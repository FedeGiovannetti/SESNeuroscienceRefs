However, there is limited understanding on how different types of poverty may affect children of various immigration backgrounds differently in outcomes such as school readiness. This study examined these relationships between household and/or neighbourhood poverty, poverty timing, and immigration background with school readiness outcomes at kindergarten. This study utilized a retrospective, population-based cohort of administrative records linked with surveys completed by kindergarten teachers for 15&#xa0;369 children born in British Columbia, Canada. The exposures investigated were neighbourhood poverty (residing in a neighbourhood in the lowest income-quintile) and/or household poverty (receiving a health insurance subsidy due to low household income). Experiencing both neighbourhood and household poverty simultaneously was defined as ""combined"" household and neighbourhood poverty. The outcome of vulnerability on school readiness domains was assessed at kindergarten (47.8% female; mean age&#xa0;=&#xa0;6.01 years) using teacher ratings on the Early Development Instrument (EDI). Children exposed to combined poverty between age 0 and 2 had greater odds of being vulnerable in two or more domains of school readiness than children not exposed to any poverty during this period (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.07, 95% CI: [1.74; 2.47], p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). The effect of combined poverty was larger than household poverty only (aOR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.54, 95% CI: [1.31; 1.82], p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) or neighbourhood poverty only (aOR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.49, 95% CI: [1.30; 1.70], p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). Combined poverty was associated with negative outcomes regardless of timing. Both non-immigrants (aOR&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.40, 95% CI: [1.92; 3.00], p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and second-generation immigrants (aOR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.63, 95% CI: [1.22; 2.17], p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) experiencing combined poverty scored lower on school readiness.

This study aimed to investigate the association between contextual factors and affordances in the home environments of infants facing poverty. Term infants (<i>n</i> = 128) were divided into two groups: (1) exposed group (EG), comprising term infants exposed to poverty, and (2) comparison group (CG), consisting of term infants classified with medium and high socio-economic status. The main dependent variables were physical space, variety of stimulation, gross and fine motor toys, and the total score; measured using the Brazilian version of the Affordances in the Home Environment for Motor Development-Infant Scale (AHEMD-IS) questionnaire, named <i>Affordances no Ambiente Domiciliar para o Desenvolvimento Motor-Escala Beb&#xea;</i>. Statistical analysis employed independent sample t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests, chi-square tests, and stepwise multiple linear regression models to evaluate predictors of less adequate home environments. The EG presented significantly fewer affordances in gross motor toys (Cohen's r = 0.353; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01); fine motor toys (Cohen's r = 0.327; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01); and total score (Cohen's r = 0.377; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Binary logistic regression analysis showed a significant association (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.828, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) between the less than adequate home environment category and maternal age (<i>p</i> = 0.043, OR: 0.829 (0.692-0.994)), revealing that maternal age was associated with better quantity and quality of affordances for child development.",2023,12,15,"Children (Basel, Switzerland)","10.3390/children10121932","PMC10742190","Children (Basel)","eng",NA,NA,"2018/24930-0; 2020/11267-1","10.1590/S0100-55022006000100010; 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31389-7; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60555-2; 10.1590/0103-1104201610902; 10.1016/j.infbeh.2011.09.005; 10.1590/1413-812320172211.01992017; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002920; 10.1590/1809-2950/14685223012016; 10.1016/0010-0277(81)90002-0; 10.1111/ped.13021; 10.1590/bjpt-rbf.2014.0112; 10.2522/ptj.20140011; 10.1590/S1413-35552013005000096; 10.1590/2237-6089-2017-0008; 10.1590/1984-0462/2023/41/2022104; 10.1111/1467-8624.t01-1-00382; 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2007.11.008; 10.1371/journal.pone.0254106; 10.1016/j.annepidem.2010.05.003; 10.1177/15579883221123852; 10.4322/2526-8910.ctoAO1183; 10.1037/a0024338; 10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.155; 10.1016/j.ijporl.2020.110353; 10.1590/1980-5764-dn-2022-0105; 10.1207/s15374424jccp3401_9; 10.14336/AD.2018.0324; 10.1126/science.1175626; 10.1111/dmcn.12693; 10.1017/S0140525X1600193X; 10.1111/desc.12066; 10.1016/j.neurenf.2017.03.009; 10.1016/j.infbeh.2018.03.002; 10.1590/1413-81232020255.32852019; 10.1016/j.tjog.2020.11.018; 10.1093/humupd/dmr026; 10.1007/s13524-018-0730-3","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","Neuropediatrics and Motricity Studies Center (NENEM), Federal University of S&#xe3;o Carlos, S&#xe3;o Carlos 13565-905, Brazil."
"38127758","Highlighting health consequences of racial disparities sparks support for action.","Riana M Brown, Pia Dietze, Maureen A Craig","Racial disparities arise across many vital areas of American life, including employment, health, and interpersonal treatment. For example, one in three Black children lives in poverty (versus one in nine white children), and, on average, Black Americans live four fewer years compared with white Americans. Which disparity is more likely to spark reduction efforts? We find that highlighting disparities in health-related (versus economic) outcomes spurs greater social media engagement and support for disparity-mitigating policy. Further, reading about racial health disparities elicits greater support for action (e.g., protesting) compared with economic- or belonging-based disparities. This occurs in part because people view health disparities as violating morally sacred values, which enhances perceived injustice. This work elucidates which manifestations of racial inequality are most likely to prompt Americans to action.",2023,12,22,"Science (New York, N.Y.)","10.1126/science.adh4262",NA,"Science","eng","D002648; D006801; D014481; D001741; D044383; D011203; D004651; D000095223","Child; Humans; United States; Black or African American; Black People; Poverty; Employment; White",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA."

Assess differences in preoperative status and postoperative outcomes among patients of different educational backgrounds undergoing surgical management of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). Patient education level (EL) has been suggested to correlate with health literacy, disease perception, socioeconomic status (SES), and access to health care. The CSM data set of the Quality Outcomes Database (QOD) was queried for patients undergoing surgical management of CSM. EL was grouped as high school or below, graduate-level, and postgraduate level. The association of EL with baseline disease severity (per patient-reported outcome measures), symptoms &gt;3 or &#x2264;3 months, and 24-month patient-reported outcome measures were evaluated. Among 1141 patients with CSM, 509 (44.6%) had an EL of high school or below, 471 (41.3%) had a graduate degree, and 161 (14.1%) had obtained postgraduate education. Lower EL was statistically significantly associated with symptom duration of &gt;3 months (odds ratio=1.68), higher arm pain numeric rating scale (NRS) (coefficient=0.5), and higher neck pain NRS (coefficient=0.79).

"38102602","Conceptualising the empowerment of caregivers raising children with developmental disabilities in Ethiopia: a qualitative study.","Zsofia Szlamka, Ikram Ahmed, Elisa Genovesi, Mersha Kinfe, Rosa A Hoekstra, Charlotte Hanlon","Caregivers of children with developmental disabilities (DDs) in Ethiopia experience stigma and exclusion. Due to limited existing services and substantial barriers to accessing care, they often lack support. Caregiver empowerment could help address injustices that hinder their capacity to support their child as they would like. The aim of this study was to explore the meaning and potential role of empowerment for caregivers raising a child with a DD and how empowerment was situated in relation to other priorities in service development. This was a qualitative phenomenological study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in Amharic and English with caregivers of children with a DD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15), clinicians (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11), community-based health extension workers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5), representatives of non-governmental organisations working with families with DDs (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17), and representatives of local authorities in health, education, and social care (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15). Data were analysed thematically. Three main themes were developed: ""Barriers to exercising caregivers' agency""; ""Whose decision is it to initiate empowerment?""; and ""Supporting caregivers through support groups"". Caregiver capacity to do what they thought was best for their child was undermined by poverty, a sense of hopelessness, experience of domestic abuse and multiple burdens experienced by those who were single mothers. Caregivers were nonetheless active in seeking to bring about change for their children. Caregivers and professionals considered support groups to be instrumental in facilitating empowerment. Participants reflected that caregiver-focused interventions could contribute to increasing caregivers' capacity to exercise their agency. A tension existed between a focus on individualistic notions of empowerment from some professionals compared to a focus on recognising expertise by experience identified as vital by caregivers. Power dynamics in the context of external funding of empowerment programmes could paradoxically disempower. Caregivers of children with DDs in Ethiopia are disempowered through poverty, stigma, and poor access to information and resources. Shifting power to caregivers and increasing their access to opportunities should be done on their own terms and in response to their prioritised needs.",2023,12,15,"BMC health services research","10.1186/s12913-023-10428-4","PMC10722818","BMC Health Serv Res","eng","D002648; D006801; D017028; D002658; D005002; D036301; D012657","Child; Humans; Caregivers; Developmental Disabilities; Ethiopia; Qualitative Research; Self-Help Groups","1658511; ES/P000703/1; NIHR200842; NIHR200842; NIHR134325; 222154/Z20/Z; 223615/Z/21/Z","10.18357/ijcyfs94201818645; 10.1177/1049732314552455; 10.1016/j.rasd.2008.04.006; 10.1007/s10826-011-9506-8; 10.1080/1366825021000008657; 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2005.00732.x; 10.1007/s10803-007-0512-z; 10.1111/jar.12209; 10.1111/j.1365-2214.2006.00644.x; 10.1007/s10803-018-3835-z; 10.1155/2016/3501910; 10.1016/j.ridd.2021.104123; 10.1192/bjo.2018.39; 10.1007/s10803-020-04557-6; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113034; 10.1186/s12991-018-0212-4; 10.3402/gha.v7.25447; 10.1017/gmh.2016.17; 10.1037/ort0000249; 10.1177/1362361317730298; 10.1177/1362361319848532; 10.1093/heapro/16.2.179; 10.1093/cdj/bss031; 10.1037/a0018854; 10.1080/01436590500235603; 10.1093/cdj/36.2.134; 10.1002/jcop.20113; 10.5014/ajot.2021.045526; 10.1093/inthealth/ihs037; 10.1007/s10826-014-0004-7; 10.1016/j.ridd.2011.01.037; 10.1371/journal.pone.0229851; 10.4102/ajod.v9i0.705; 10.1016/j.pec.2018.07.026; 10.1111/j.1365-2524.2010.00976.x; 10.1093/heapol/czz025; 10.1002/cl2.1070; 10.1080/00207411.2019.1629264; 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005799; 10.1007/S40037-019-0509-2; 10.1186/s12913-022-07889-4; 10.1186/s13033-017-0144-4; 10.1186/s13033-019-0268-9; 10.7748/nr2013.03.20.4.12.e326; 10.1186/s12913-016-1383-9; 10.1186/s13033-017-0121-y; 10.1080/13645570701401305; 10.1177/1525822X05279903; 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; 10.1177/070674370505000206; 10.1093/intqhc/mzm042; 10.1037/h0089739; 10.1177/1362361311422708; 10.1007/s40615-019-00575-y; 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60685-6; 10.2147/IJGM.S369408; 10.2147/PHMT.S344715; 10.1111/j.1471-0366.2012.00377.x; 10.2471/BLT.15.168252; 10.1257/jep.21.1.141; 10.1371/journal.pone.0232217; 10.1097/YCO.0000000000000506","The authors declare no competing interests.","Department of Health Service and Population Research, Institute of Psychiatry, Centre for Global Mental Health, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."

Research prior to the pandemic suggests that women may be more at risk of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) due to unmet expectations of their childbirth plans. Therefore, this study aimed to examine if the mismatch between women's planned birth and actual birth experiences during COVID-19 was associated with women's postpartum PTSS. Women in the postpartum period (up to 6&#xa0;months after birth) across 11 countries reported on childbirth experiences, mental health, COVID-19-related factors, and PTSS (PTSD checklist DSM-5 version) using self-report questionnaires (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04595123). More than half (64%) of the 3532 postpartum women included in the analysis reported changes to their childbirth plans. All changes were significantly associated with PTSS scores. Participants with one and two changes to their childbirth plans had a 12% and 38% increase, respectively, in PTSS scores compared to those with no changes (Exp(&#x3b2;)&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.12; 95% CI [1.06-1.19]; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001 and Exp(&#x3b2;)&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.38; 95% CI [1.29-1.48]; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). In addition, the effect of having one change in the childbirth plan on PTSS scores was stronger in primigravida than in multigravida (Exp(&#x3b2;)&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.86; 95% CI [0.77-0.97]; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014). Changes to women's childbirth plans during the COVID-19 pandemic were common and associated with women's postpartum PTSS score. Developing health policies that protect women from the negative consequences of unexpected or unintended birth experiences is important for perinatal mental health.",2023,12,16,"Archives of women's mental health","10.1007/s00737-023-01403-3",NA,"Arch Womens Ment Health","</AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Hadjigeorgiou</LastName><ForeName>Eleni</ForeName><Initials>E</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Nursing, School of Health Science, Cyprus University of Technology, Limassol, Cyprus.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Hancheva</LastName><ForeName>Camellia</ForeName><Initials>C</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Sofia University ""St. Kliment Ohridski"", Sofia, Bulgaria.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Contreras-Garc&#xed;a</LastName><ForeName>Yolanda</ForeName><Initials>Y</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Departamento de Obstetricia y Puericultura Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Concepci&#xf3;n, Concepci&#xf3;n, Chile.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Dom&#xed;nguez-Salas</LastName><ForeName>Sara</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Departamento de Psicolog&#xed;a Experimental, Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Motrico</LastName><ForeName>Emma</ForeName><Initials>E</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, University of Loyola, Sevilla, Spain.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Soares</LastName><ForeName>Isabel</ForeName><Initials>I</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Psychology, CIPsi, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Ayers</LastName><ForeName>Susan</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, University of Loyola, Sevilla, Spain.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Centre for Maternal and Child Health Research School of Health and Psychological Sciences, City, University of London, London, United Kingdom.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng",NA,NA,"UIDB/04750/2020; UIDB/05380/2020; SFRH/BPD/117597/2016; NORTE-06-3559-FSE-000044; UIDB/PSI/01662/2020; 01/C05-i02 /2022; 16.12.2020; FNI; Academic Clinical Lecturer","10.1186/s12884-022-04637-8; 10.1017/S0033291715002706; 10.1007/s00737-018-0889-z; 10.1037/pas0000254; 10.1093/hsw/hlac001; 10.1186/s13006-022-00519-z; 10.1046/j.1523-536x.2000.00104.x; 10.1348/014466500163095; 10.1016/j.jad.2022.01.108; 10.1016/j.wombi.2021.12.003; 10.1186/1471-2393-14-191; 10.1111/hex.13077; 10.1016/j.ajog.2021.11.1346; 10.1080/08870446.2011.649755; 10.1016/j.cpr.2022.102157; 10.1037/tra0000629; 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2022.110716; 10.1089/jwh.2020.8866; 10.1186/s12978-021-01070-6; 10.1111/birt.12634; 10.1007/s00404-021-06310-5; 10.1080/02646838.2015.1031646; 10.1089/jwh.2022.0400; 10.1186/s12884-020-03399-5; 10.3126/jkmc.v4i1.15024; 10.1186/s12992-020-00589-w; 10.1007/s10995-021-03344-8; 10.1046/j.1523-536X.2003.00215.x; 10.1080/02646838.2013.784960; 10.1016/j.clet.2022.100440; 10.1016/j.appet.2020.104985; 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2012.07.010; 10.1186/s12884-021-03898-z; 10.1007/s00737-019-00994-0; 10.1007/s11222-012-9343-7",NA,"Department of Psychology, University of Loyola, Sevilla, Spain."
"38095998","The rich get richer? Children's reasoning about socioeconomic status predicts inclusion and resource bias.","Brenda C Straka, Analia Albuja, Jane Leer, Kaelah Brauher, Sarah E Gaither","Children's socioeconomic status (SES) is linked to disparate access to resources and affects social behaviors such as inclusion and resource allocations. Yet it is unclear whether children's essentialized view of SES (i.e., believing SES is immutable) or subjective social status (SSS) influences behavioral biases toward high- versus low-SES peers. We measured 4- to 9-year-old children's SES essentialism and SSS to test whether these predict inclusion and resource allocations to high- versus low-SES peers (<i>N</i> = 127; from a midsize city in the Southeastern United States; 49.6% female; parent-reported 54.2% White, 2.8% Black, 8.3% Latine, 5.6% Asian, 1.4% another race, 27.8% multiracial, 43.3% not provided). We also compared children's SES beliefs to their parent's. Children's SES essentialism and SSS decreased across the ages tested, and children reported higher SSS than their parents. Parents' SES essentialism predicted younger (but not older) children's SES essentialism. Moreover, SES essentialism mediated the negative relationship between age and preference for including high-SES peers, while SSS mediated the negative relationship between age and preference for allocating more resources to high-SES peers. This suggests that beliefs about the nature of SES may influence sociorelational behavior like including or excluding others, while perceived social status (SSS) may influence resource allocations. Furthermore, older children and those with lower SES essentialism included low- versus high-SES peers more often while older and lower SSS children distributed more resources toward low- versus high-SES peers. Thus, children's SES essentialism and SSS may also influence their behaviors to either perpetuate or rectify inequality.

"38088153","Strengthening self-regulation and reducing poverty to prevent adolescent depression and anxiety: Rationale, approach and methods of the ALIVE interdisciplinary research collaboration in Colombia, Nepal and South Africa.","Crick Lund, Mark J D Jordans, Emily Garman, Ricardo Araya, Mauricio Avendano, Annette Bauer, Vikram Bahure, Tarun Dua, Georgia Eleftheriou,  ..., Paula Yarrow","Depression and anxiety are the leading contributors to the global burden of disease among young people, accounting for over a third (34.8%) of years lived with disability. Yet there is limited evidence for interventions that prevent adolescent depression and anxiety in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where 90% of adolescents live. This article introduces the 'Improving Adolescent mentaL health by reducing the Impact of poVErty (ALIVE)' study, its conceptual framework, objectives, methods and expected outcomes. The aim of the ALIVE study is to develop and pilot-test an intervention that combines poverty reduction with strengthening self-regulation to prevent depression and anxiety among adolescents living in urban poverty in Colombia, Nepal and South Africa. This aim will be achieved by addressing four objectives: (1) develop a conceptual framework that identifies the causal mechanisms linking poverty, self-regulation and depression and anxiety; (2) develop a multi-component selective prevention intervention targeting self-regulation and poverty among adolescents at high risk of developing depression or anxiety; (3) adapt and validate instruments to measure incidence of depression and anxiety, mediators and implementation parameters of the prevention intervention; and (4) undertake a four-arm pilot cluster randomised controlled trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability and cost of the selective prevention intervention in the three study sites. The contributions of this study include the active engagement and participation of adolescents in the research process; a focus on the causal mechanisms of the intervention; building an evidence base for prevention interventions in LMICs; and the use of an interdisciplinary approach. By developing and evaluating an intervention that addresses multidimensional poverty and self-regulation, ALIVE can make contributions to evidence on the integration of mental health into broader development policy and practice.",2023,12,13,"Epidemiology and psychiatric sciences","10.1017/S2045796023000811",NA,"Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci","eng","D000293; D006801; D001007; D003105; D003863; D000075762; D009390; D011203; D000068356; D013019","Adolescent; Humans; Anxiety; Colombia; Depression; Interdisciplinary Research; Nepal; Poverty; Self-Control; South Africa",NA,"NA",NA,"Waves for Change, Cape Town, South Africa."
"38078276","Linguistic findings in persons with schizophrenia-a review of the current literature.","Felicitas Ehlen, Christiane Montag, Karolina Leopold, Andreas Heinz","Alterations of verbalized thought occur frequently in psychotic disorders. We characterize linguistic findings in individuals with schizophrenia based on the current literature, including findings relevant for differential and early diagnosis. Review of literature published via PubMed search between January 2010 and May 2022. A total of 143 articles were included. In persons with schizophrenia, language-related alterations can occur at all linguistic levels. Differentiating from findings in persons with affective disorders, typical symptoms in those with schizophrenia mainly include so-called ""poverty of speech,"" reduced word and sentence production, impaired processing of complex syntax, pragmatic language deficits as well as reduced semantic verbal fluency. At the at-risk state, ""poverty of content,"" pragmatic difficulties and reduced verbal fluency could be of predictive value. The current results support multilevel alterations of the language system in persons with schizophrenia. Creative expressions of psychotic experiences are frequently found but are not in the focus of this review. Clinical examinations of linguistic alterations can support differential diagnostics and early detection. Computational methods (Natural Language Processing) may improve the precision of corresponding diagnostics. The relations between language-related and other symptoms can improve diagnostics.",2023,1,1,"Frontiers in psychology","10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1287706","PMC10710163","Front Psychol","<CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#xa9;

We evaluated the long-term interplay of the crisis and these factors with substance use difficulties five years after the crisis onset. A household probability sample of 1970 adults living in Flint during the crisis was surveyed about their crisis experiences, use of substances since the crisis, and risk/resilience factors, including prior potentially traumatic event exposure and current social support. Analyses were weighted to produce population-representative estimates. Of the survey respondents, 17.0% reported that substance use since the crisis contributed to problems with their home, work, or social lives, including 11.2% who used despite a doctor's warnings that it would harm their health, 12.3% who used while working or going to school, and 10.7% who experienced blackouts after heavy use. A total of 61.6% of respondents reported using alcohol since the crisis, 32.4% using cannabis, and 5.2% using heroin, methamphetamine, or non-prescribed prescription opioids. Respondents who believed that exposure to contaminated water harmed their physical health were more likely to use substances to the detriment of their daily lives (RR = 1.32, 95%CI: 1.03-1.70), as were respondents with prior potentially traumatic exposure (RR = 2.99, 95%CI: 1.90-4.71), low social support (RR = 1.94, 95%CI: 1.41-2.66), and PTSD and depression (RR's of 1.78 and 1.49, respectively, <i>p</i>-values &lt; 0.01).

We examined the relationship between individual- and neighborhood-level socioeconomic status (SES) and CHIP and evaluated effect modification by interpersonal and intrapersonal resources. The study population included 10,799 postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative without hematologic malignancy or antineoplastic medication use. Individual- and neighborhood (Census tract)-level SES were assessed across several domains including education, income, and occupation, and a neighborhood-level SES summary z-score, which captures multiple dimensions of SES, was generated. Interpersonal and intrapersonal resources were self-reports. CHIP was ascertained based on a prespecified list of leukemogenic driver mutations. Weighted logistic regression models adjusted for covariates were used to estimate risk of CHIP as an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI).

The aim of this study was to examine impact of the pandemic on mental health care and people with mental health conditions in Ethiopia. A convergent mixed methods study was conducted. We systematically mapped information from publicly available reports on impacts of the pandemic on mental health care. Monthly service utilisation data were obtained from Amanuel Mental Specialised Hospital, the main psychiatric hospital, and analysed using segmented Poisson regression (2019 vs. 2020). In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 purposively selected key informants. Framework analysis was used for qualitative data. Findings from each data source were integrated. In the early stages of the pandemic, participants indicated a minimal response towards the mental health aspects of COVID-19. Mental health-related stigma and discrimination was evident. Scarce mental health service settings were diverted to become COVID-19 treatment centres. Mental health care became narrowly biomedical with poorer quality of care due to infrequent follow-up. Households of people with pre-existing mental health conditions in the community reported worsening poverty and decreased access to care due to restricted movement, decreased availability and fear. Lack of reliable medication supplies increased relapse and the chance of becoming chained at home, abandoned or homeless. Caregiver burden was exacerbated. Within mental health facilities, prisons and residential units, infection control procedures did not adequately safeguard those with mental health conditions. Meanwhile, the needs of people with mental health conditions in COVID-19 quarantine and treatment facilities were systematically neglected. Only late in the day were integrated services developed to address both physical and mental health needs. The COVID-19 pandemic had substantial negative impacts on the lives of people with mental health conditions in Ethiopia. Future emergency response should prioritise the human rights, health, social and economic needs of people with mental health conditions. Integration of mental and physical health care would both expand access to care and increase resilience of the mental health system.",2023,12,6,"International journal of mental health systems","10.1186/s13033-023-00612-8","PMC10699067","Int J Ment Health Syst","eng",NA,NA,"DEL-15-01","10.1007/s00127-020-01924-7; 10.1111/ppc.12618; 10.1016/S2214-109X(21)00253-9; 10.2147/PRBM.S264286; 10.1016/j.schres.2005.05.028; 10.1007/s00127-003-0678-4; 10.1016/j.jad.2005.03.011; 10.1186/1752-4458-6-23; 10.1186/s12889-016-2911-6; 10.1186/s12888-019-2281-6; 10.1007/s00127-018-1546-6; 10.1192/bjp.bp.114.149112; 10.1186/1471-244X-11-165; 10.1093/schbul/sbn029; 10.1017/S2045796019000398; 10.1186/s13033-019-0294-7; 10.1186/s12939-019-1020-4; 10.1186/s12889-019-7239-6; 10.1186/s13033-019-0332-5; 10.1111/tmi.13370; 10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108636; 10.1016/S2215-0366(21)00384-9; 10.1136/bmjgh-2018-001108; 10.1016/S2214-109X(22)00027-4; 10.1192/bjo.2021.999; 10.1186/s40814-021-00773-8; 10.1186/s13063-020-04331-0; 10.1186/s12991-021-00344-4; 10.7748/nr2011.01.18.2.52.c8284; 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-070367; 10.1186/s12888-020-02638-5; 10.1016/S2215-0366(21)00025-0; 10.1080/16549716.2017.1337356; 10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.101151; 10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30090-0; 10.1186/s13033-022-00540-z; 10.1186/s12888-017-1352-9; 10.1186/s13033-017-0144-4; 10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30307-2; 10.1186/1472-6963-14-113; 10.1192/bjp.bp.114.153676","The authors declare no competing interests.","Department of Psychiatry, WHO Collaborating Centre for Mental Health Research and Capacity-Building, School of Medicine, College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia."

Children in rural areas from low socioeconomic (SES) backgrounds face unique physical activity contextual challenges. In line with Stage 0 with the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development, the objective of the present study was to conduct a community-engaged needs assessment survey with middle school children and adults to identify perceptions, barriers, and facilitators of physical activity, sport, psychological needs, and nutrition from a multi-level lens. A cross-sectional survey data collection was conducted with children (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;39) and adults (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;63) from one middle school community in the Midwestern United States. The child sample was 33% 6th grade; 51% 7th grade and was 49% female. The adult sample was primarily between 30 and 39 years old (70%) and comprised predominantly of females (85%). Multi-level survey design was guided by the psychological needs mini-theory within self-determination theory and aimed to identify individual perceptions, barriers, and facilitators in line with the unique context of the community. At the individual level, 71.8% of children and 82.2% of the overall sample (children and adults) were interested in new physical activity/sport programming for their school. Likewise, 89.7% of children and 96.8% of adults agree that PA is good for physical health. For basic psychological needs in the overall sample, relatedness was significantly greater than the autonomy and competence subscales. Children's fruit and vegetable intake were below recommended levels, yet only 43.6% of children were interested in nutritional programming. Conversely, 61.5% indicated interest at increasing leadership skills. At the policy-systems-environmental level, the respondents' feedback indicated that the condition and availability of equipment are areas in need of improvement to encourage more physical activity. Qualitative responses are presented within for physical activity-related school policy changes. Interventions addressing children's physical activity lack sustainability, scalability, and impact due to limited stakeholder involvement and often neglect early behavioral intervention stages.

Knowledge will be generated on whether the mental health intervention could potentially improve young people's mental health and human capital in conflict-affected areas? We will evaluate of the impact of potential mental health improvements on human capital outcomes, including educational and employment outcomes. Findings will help to make conclusions about the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, and it will assess its effectiveness to improve the mental health and human capital outcomes of beneficiaries. This will enable the identification of strategies to address mental health problems among socioeconomically vulnerable young people that can be adapted to different contexts in in low and middle-income countries.",2023,1,1,"Frontiers in psychiatry","10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1238725","PMC10686213","Front Psychiatry","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30934-1; 10.21615/cesp.12.3.1; 10.1016/j.rcp.2014.07.003; 10.1016/j.rcp.2016.04.007; 10.1037/a0022257; 10.1136/bmjgh-2019-002014; 10.21615/cesmedicina.32.2.6; 10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30382-5; 10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30134-2; 10.1192/bji.2018.4; 10.1257/aer.99.3.1006; 10.1111/j.1468-0262.2004.00481.x; 10.1257/aer.20150503; 10.2196/13392; 10.2196/jmir.9208; 10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00664; 10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00552; 10.1007/s00127-021-02043-7; 10.1016/j.invent.2018.11.005; 10.1080/14733145.2012.733715; 10.1186/1477-7525-8-8; 10.1016/j.sleep.2011.06.019; 10.1093/sleep/34.5.601; 10.1097/MLR.0b013e3182408812; 10.1177/1744987109352932","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","Eje de Salud Poblacional, Fundaci&#xf3;n Santa Fe de Bogot&#xe1;, Bogot&#xe1;, Colombia."

To explore clinician-reported and patient-reported inequities between patients under the poverty threshold vs. the others. 916 patients consecutively recruited in 10 national centers received a comprehensive standardized evaluation of illness severity, addictions and patient-reported outcomes. 739 (80.7%) of the patients were classified in the poverty group. This group had poorer objective illness outcomes (lower positive, negative, cognitive, excitement/aggressive and self-neglect symptoms and lifetime history of planned suicide) in multivariate analyses. While they had similar access to treatments and psychotherapy, they had lower access to socially useful activities, couple's life, housing and parenthood. They had also more disturbed metabolic parameters. On the contrary, the poverty group reported better self-esteem. No significant difference for depression, risky health behavior including addictions and sedentary behavior was found. The equity in access to care is attributed to the French social system. However, mental and physical health remain poorer in these patients, and they still experience poor access to social roles independently of illness severity and despite healthcare interventions. These patients may have paradoxically better self-esteem due to decreased contact with society and therefore lower stigma exposure (especially at work). Schizophrenia presents itself as a distinct impoverished population concerning health-related outcomes and social integration, warranting focus in public health initiatives and improved treatment, including tailored interventions, collaborative care models, accessible mental health services, housing support, vocational training and employment support, community integration, education and awareness, research and data collection, culturally competent approaches, and long-term support.",2023,1,1,"Frontiers in public health","10.3389/fpubh.2023.1182441","PMC10646173","Front Public Health","eng","D006801; D012559; D004651; D057545; D011203","Humans; Schizophrenia; Employment; Social Stigma; Poverty",NA,"10.1177/1403494819848276; 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2017.11.020; 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31869-X; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.2299; 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.109877; 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.11.006; 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.08.024; 10.1017/S2045796020000785; 10.1192/bjp.2020.143; 10.1186/s13033-020-00348-9; 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.109927; 10.1016/j.encep.2018.07.007; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2015.05.004; 10.1093/schbul/13.2.261; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1994.tb01487.x; 10.1192/bjp.124.5.460; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2000.tb10933.x; 10.1093/schbul/sbu001; 10.1016/j.schres.2016.10.023; 10.1080/09638288.2017.1312568; 10.1136/bjsports-2020-102955; 10.1016/j.schres.2010.05.019; 10.1186/s13034-017-0207-y; 10.1037//0022-3514.63.3.452; 10.1016/S0895-4356(00)00314-0; 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2019.01.003; 10.1192/bjp.2018.87; 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000455; 10.1037/0278-6133.27.5.576; 10.1002/oby.21716; 10.1093/aje/kwf182; 10.1037/bul0000258; 10.1176/appi.ps.201400073; 10.1093/schbul/sbaa181; 10.4088/JCP.20m13732; 10.1016/j.schres.2020.07.017; 10.1093/schbul/sbaa153","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","Fondation FondaMental, Cr&#xe9;teil, France."

Here, we take a data-driven approach to exploring how measures of children's environments relate to the development of their brain structure and function in a community sample of children between the ages of 4 and 10 years. We constructed exposomes including measures of family socioeconomic status, children's exposure to adversity, and geocoded measures of neighborhood socioeconomic status, crime, and environmental toxins. We connected the exposome to two structural measures (cortical thickness and surface area, <i>n</i> = 170) and two functional measures (participation coefficient and clustering coefficient, <i>n</i> = 130). We found dense connections <i>within</i> exposome and brain layers and sparse connections <i>between</i> exposome and brain layers. Lower family income was associated with thinner visual cortex, consistent with the theory that accelerated development is detectable in early-developing regions. Greater neighborhood incidence of high blood lead levels was associated with greater segregation of the default mode network, consistent with evidence that toxins are deposited into the brain along the midline.

AMS aim to enable timely initiation of pharmacologic treatment, build hospital capacity to support patients who use substances, and facilitate transition to community services. As an emerging service being adopted in hospitals across North America, the model of care, populations served, substance use trends, and clinical trajectory has not been widely described. This work aims to characterize patients accessing care through the AMS, establishing predictors for clinical trajectories in hospital including patient-initiated discharge (PID) and hospital re-admission. Using a retrospective cohort design, we describe all patients seen by the AMS between 2018 and 2022 across four hospitals in Hamilton, Ontario. Patients seen by AMS were hospitalized and qualified for a SUD based on DSM-V criteria. The study used descriptive statistics to describe the cohort, where appropriate adjusted time-to-event survival models were constructed to identify predictors for hospital re-admission. Patients seen by the AMS (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;695) frequently lacked access to primary care (47.0&#xa0;%) and less than half (44.3&#xa0;%) were receiving community addiction services on admission. The majority met criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD), with injecting being the primary consumption route (54.8&#xa0;%). Patients exhibited high acuity, with 34.2&#xa0;% requiring critical care measures. Provision of OAT substantially increased to 77.9&#xa0;% of patients (29&#xa0;% on admission). PID occurred in 17.8&#xa0;% of patients and was significantly associated with an admitting diagnosis of suicidal ideation, infection, heart failure, and distinct substance use profiles including methamphetamine, fentanyl, and heroin use (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). PID conferred a 66&#xa0;% increased risk for re-admission (Hazard-Ratio: 1.66; 95&#xa0;% CI: 1.08, 2.54; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02).

The aim of this study was to identify whether age-5 caries is associated with (a) biomarkers for poor physical health, and (b) the pace of aging (PoA) by age 45&#x2009;years. Participants are members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study birth cohort. At age 45, 94.1% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;938) of those still alive took part. Data on age-5 caries experience and age-45 health biomarkers were collected. The PoA captures age-related decline across the cardiovascular, metabolic, renal, immune, dental and pulmonary systems from age 26 to 45&#x2009;years. We used (a) generalized estimating equations to examine associations between age-5 caries and poor physical health by age 45&#x2009;years, and (b) ordinary least squares regression to examine whether age-5 caries was associated with the PoA. Analyses adjusted for sex, perinatal health, childhood SES and childhood IQ. High caries experience at age-5 was associated with higher risk for some metabolic abnormalities, including BMI &#x2265;30, high waist circumference, and high serum leptin. Those with high caries experience at age-5 were aging at a faster rate by age 45&#x2009;years than those who had been caries-free. Oral health is essential for wellbeing.

Data were used from Maastricht Aging Study, a prospective cohort study with a 12-year follow-up. The baseline sample consisted of 1023 adults over 40 years old. The ""LIfestyle for BRAin health"" (LIBRA) index was used to assess modifiable dementia risk. Cognitive performance was assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 years, and measured in the domains of information processing speed, executive functioning and verbal memory function. An SES score was calculated from equivalent income and educational level (tertiles). Linear mixed models were used to study the association between LIBRA, SES and their interaction on the rate of cognitive decline. Participants in the lowest SES tertile displayed more decline in information processing speed (vs. middle SES: X<sup>2</sup> = 7.08, <i>P</i> = 0.029; vs. high SES: X<sup>2</sup> = 9.49, <i>P</i> = 0.009) and verbal memory (vs. middle SES: X<sup>2</sup> = 9.28, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; vs. high SES: X<sup>2</sup> = 16.68, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) over 6 years compared to their middle- and high-SES counterparts. Higher (unhealthier) LIBRA scores were associated with more decline in information processing speed (X<sup>2</sup> = 12.66, <i>P</i> = 0.002) over 12 years and verbal memory (X<sup>2</sup> = 4.63, <i>P</i> = 0.032) over 6 years. No consistent effect modification by SES on the association between LIBRA and cognition was found. Results suggest that lifestyle is an important determinant of cognitive decline across SES groups.

Children in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC)-particularly those affected by poverty, armed conflict, and forced migration-may be at increased risk of maltreatment due to heightened parental distress and disruptions to social support networks. Parenting interventions have been shown to reduce the risk of child maltreatment as well as improve a range of caregiver and child outcomes, yet large-scale implementation remains limited in low-resource displacement settings. This study will examine the impact of an entertainment-education narrative film intervention on reducing physical and emotional abuse and increasing positive parenting among migrant and displaced families from Myanmar living in Thailand. The study is a pragmatic, superiority cluster randomized controlled trial with approximately 40 communities randomized to the intervention or treatment as usual arms in a 1:1 ratio. Participating families in the intervention arm will be invited to attend a community screening of the film intervention and a post-screening discussion, as well as receive a poster depicting key messages from the film. Primary outcomes are changes in physical abuse, emotional abuse, and positive parenting behaviour. Secondary outcomes include caregiver knowledge of positive parenting, caregiver attitudes towards harsh punishment, caregiver psychological distress, and family functioning. Outcomes will be assessed at 3 time points: baseline, 4 weeks post-intervention, and 4-month follow up. A mixed methods process evaluation will be embedded within the trial to assess intervention delivery, acceptability, perceived impacts, and potential mechanisms of change. To our knowledge, this study will be the first randomized controlled trial evaluation of a film-based intervention to reduce child maltreatment among migrant and displaced families in a LMIC. An integrated knowledge translation approach will inform uptake of study findings and application to potential scale up pending evaluation results.

However, the associations between sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances, social disadvantage during pregnancy, and neonatal brain structure remains poorly understood. The current study explored the association between maternal sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances during pregnancy and neonatal brain outcomes, examining sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances as a mediator of the effect of social disadvantage during pregnancy on infant structural brain outcomes. The study included 148 mother-infant dyads, recruited during early pregnancy, who had both actigraphy and neuroimaging data. Mothers' sleep was assessed throughout their pregnancy using actigraphy, and neonates underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging in the first weeks of life. Neonatal structural brain outcomes included cortical gray matter, subcortical gray matter, and white matter volumes along with a measure of the total surface area of the cortex. Neonates of mothers who experienced greater inter-daily deviations in sleep duration had smaller total cortical gray and white matter volumes and reduced cortical surface areas. Neonates of mothers who had higher levels of circadian misalignment and later sleep timing during pregnancy showed smaller subcortical gray matter volumes. Inter-daily deviations in sleep duration during pregnancy mediated the association between maternal social disadvantage and neonatal structural brain outcomes. Findings highlight the importance of regularity and rhythmicity in sleep schedules during pregnancy and bring to light the role of chronodisruption as a potential mechanism underlying the deleterious neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal adversity. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Social disadvantage was associated with sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances during pregnancy, including later sleep schedules, increased variability in sleep duration, circadian misalignment, and a higher proportion of the sleep period spent awake. Maternal sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances during pregnancy were associated with decreased brain volume and reduced cortical surface area in neonates.

However, a comprehensive analysis of the impact of different parental beliefs on the spatial HLE remains lacking, leaving unanswered questions about which specific parental beliefs are most influential and whether inducing a growth mindset can enhance the spatial HLE. To address these gaps, we conducted an online study with parents of 3- to 5-year-olds. We found that parents' growth mindset about their children's ability strongly predicted the spatial HLE after controlling for parents' motivational beliefs about their children, beliefs about their own ability, children's age, children's gender, and family SES. Further, reading an article about growth mindset led parents to choose more challenging spatial learning activities for their children. These findings highlight the critical role of parents' growth mindset in the spatial HLE. Crucially, these findings demonstrate that general growth mindset messages without specific suggestions for parental practices can influence parental behavior intentions. Further, these effects were also observed in the control domain of literacy, underscoring the broad relevance of the growth mindset in the HLE.",2023,10,9,"Journal of Intelligence","10.3390/jintelligence11100193","PMC10607904","J Intell","eng",NA,NA,"1760144; 220020546","10.1073/pnas.1607946113; 10.1007/s10339-013-0550-8; 10.3758/s13423-021-02012-w; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2012.07.002; 10.1016/j.ambp.2008.01.002; 10.1037/a0013844; 10.1207/s1532799xssr1004_1; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2012.01.002; 10.1177/0829573516645773; 10.1016/j.appdev.2005.12.001; 10.1080/10409289.2017.1331662; 10.2308/bria-18-044; 10.1037/0022-0663.95.3.465; 10.1155/2012/602807; 10.2307/1128973; 10.1016/j.jecp.2017.01.011; 10.1177/0142723711422626; 10.1111/j.1751-228X.2011.01122.x; 10.1016/j.appdev.2003.09.002; 10.1037/dev0000282; 10.1371/journal.pone.0168227; 10.1017/CBO9780511610448.005; 10.1007/978-3-642-14749-4_10; 10.1002/icd.2061; 10.1002/j.2168-9830.1997.tb00278.x; 10.1111/j.1467-9817.2012.01548.x; 10.1016/j.conb.2016.02.007; 10.1177/0956797614563338; 10.1037/bul0000191; 10.1037/a0025913; 10.1016/j.jrp.2021.104165; 10.1037/0012-1649.36.5.596; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2013.05.004; 10.1037/edu0000626; 10.1016/B978-0-12-394388-0.00006-X; 10.1037/a0020376; 10.1016/j.appdev.2015.08.002; 10.1111/j.1467-9817.2010.01438.x; 10.1111/cdep.12389; 10.1177/14687984020022001; 10.1080/10888438.2017.1313846; 10.1177/0956797617711968; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2011.01088.x; 10.1007/s11145-009-9175-9; 10.1111/desc.12792; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2014.08.004; 10.1111/1467-8624.00417; 10.1111/cdev.12222; 10.1598/rrq.33.1.5; 10.1037/0022-0663.88.3.520; 10.1037/0022-0663.93.3.604; 10.1155/2012/851657; 10.1080/09500690802595839; 10.1016/j.cogdev.2018.04.005; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2018.07.008; 10.1111/desc.13302; 10.1016/j.appdev.2021.101318; 10.1016/j.tine.2014.02.005; 10.1111/mono.12282; 10.1037/0033-2909.117.2.250; 10.21105/joss.01285; 10.1037/a0016127; 10.1016/S0039-6060(03)00248-4; 10.1037/0022-0663.99.2.397; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1998.tb06247.x; 10.1002/sce.10126; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2018.07.009","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University Bloomington, Bloomington, IN 47405, USA."

Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are effective and can be delivered in primary care, but uptake has been limited in rural communities. Referral to and coordination with an external telemedicine (TM) vendor by rural primary care clinics for MOUD (TM-MOUD) may increase MOUD access for rural patients, but we know little about perspectives on this model among key stakeholders. As part of a TM-MOUD feasibility study, we explored TM-MOUD acceptability and feasibility among personnel and patients from seven rural primary care clinics and a TM-MOUD vendor. We conducted virtual interviews or focus groups with clinic administrators (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;7 interviews), clinic primary care and behavioral health providers (8 groups, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;30), other clinic staff (9 groups, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;37), patients receiving MOUD (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;16 interviews), TM-MOUD vendor staff (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;4 interviews), and vendor-affiliated behavioral health and prescribing providers (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;17 interviews). We asked about experiences with and acceptability of MOUD (primarily buprenorphine) and telemedicine (TM) and a TM-MOUD referral and coordination model. We conducted content analysis to identify themes and participants quantitatively rated acceptability of TM-MOUD elements on a 4-item scale. Perceived benefits of vendor-based TM-MOUD included reduced logistical barriers, more privacy and less stigma, and access to services not available locally (e.g., counseling, pain management). Barriers included lack of internet or poor connectivity in patients' homes, limited communication and trust between TM-MOUD and clinic providers, and questions about the value to the clinic of TM-MOUD referral to external vendor. Acceptability ratings for TM-MOUD were generally high; they were lowest among frontline staff. Rural primary care clinic personnel, TM-MOUD vendor personnel, and patients generally perceived referral from primary care to a TM-MOUD vendor to hold potential for increasing access to MOUD in rural communities. Increasing TM-MOUD uptake requires buy-in and understanding among staff of the TM-MOUD workflow, TM services offered, requirements for patients, advantages over clinic-based or TM services from clinic providers, and identification of appropriate patients. Poverty, along with patient hesitation to initiate treatment, creates substantial barriers to MOUD treatment generally; insufficient internet availability creates a substantial barrier to TM-MOUD.",2024,1,1,"Journal of substance use and addiction treatment","10.1016/j.josat.2023.209194",NA,"J Subst Use Addict Treat","eng","D006801; D012424; D009293; D000083682; D000288; D011320","Humans; Rural Population; Opioid-Related Disorders; Opiate Overdose; Administrative Personnel; Primary Health Care",NA,"NA","Declaration of competing interest None.","Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA."

A further aim was to determine whether patient age was associated with an increased risk of not achieving symmetrical muscle function within the first 2&#xa0;years after ACL reconstruction. The patient data in the present study were extracted from the rehabilitation outcome registry, Project ACL. Patients aged 11-25&#xa0;years registered for primary ACL reconstruction with a hamstring tendon autograft between April 1, 2013 and November 23, 2020 were included. A total of 691 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study; 41 paediatric patients (females 11-13, males 11-15&#xa0;years), 347 adolescents (females 14-19, males 16-19&#xa0;years) and 303 young adults (females 20-25, males 20-25&#xa0;years). The comparison between groups revealed that 70% of paediatric patients, 39% of adolescents and 35% of young adults had returned to knee-strenuous sport at 8 months and that 90% of paediatric patients, 71% of adolescents and 62% of young adults had returned to sport at 12&#xa0;months. Paediatric patients also reported higher scores compared with both the other patient groups on the Knee Self-Efficacy Scale (K-SES) and the Anterior Cruciate Ligament Return to Sport after Injury scale (ACL-RSI) at 8 and 12&#xa0;months.

Poverty can lead to poorer mental health, which reduces opportunities and increases the risk of lifetime poverty. Cash transfer programmes are one of the most common strategies to reduce poverty and now reach substantial proportions of populations living in low- and middle-income countries. Because of their rapid expansion in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, they have recently gained even more importance. Recently, there have been suggestions that these cash transfers might improve youth mental health, disrupting the cycle of disadvantage at a critical period of life. Here, we present a conceptual framework describing potential mechanisms by which cash transfer programmes could improve the mental health and life chances of young people. Furthermore, we explore how theories from behavioural economics and cognitive psychology could be used to more specifically target these mechanisms and optimise the impact of cash transfers on youth mental health and life chances. Based on this, we identify several lines of enquiry and action for future research and policy.",2023,1,1,"Global mental health (Cambridge, England)","10.1017/gmh.2023.4","PMC10579689","Glob Ment Health (Camb)","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/S2352-4642(22)00073-6; 10.3368/jhr.48.2.370; 10.4073/csr.2013.8; 10.1016/S2215-0366(19)30511-5; 10.1017/S0047279418000715; 10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30382-5; 10.1257/pol.20130225; 10.1257/aer.20150503; 10.1080/02692171.2019.1649641; 10.1057/s41300-019-00075-5; 10.1093/wbro/lky002; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.3221; 10.1016/j.jaac.2018.07.896; 10.1136/bmj.a2981; 10.1001/jama.2010.621; 10.1287/mnsc.2014.1901; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.0217; 10.1080/13600818.2015.1065313; 10.2307/2657556; 10.1136/jech-2015-205868; 10.1057/9780230596023; 10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.01.014; 10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.05.020; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114631; 10.1353/bsp.2021.0003; 10.1007/s40865-019-00126-3; 10.1126/science.1232491; 10.1093/qje/qjw033; 10.1257/app.20150048; 10.1017/S2045796021000561; 10.1016/S2214-109X(18)30560-6; 10.1002/pmh.1465; 10.2139/ssrn.2139541; 10.1162/qjec.122.1.159; 10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30060-9; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60754-X; 10.1111/j.1759-5436.2011.00274.x; 10.1371/journal.pone.0208925; 10.1186/s12889-017-4513-3; 10.31235/osf.io/ydr54; 10.1038/s41562-021-01252-z; 10.17226/25388; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113181; 10.1093/heapol/czy020; 10.1002/wps.20492; 10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31612-X; 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00579-1; 10.1080/00220388.2015.1134774; 10.1086/655458; 10.1016/S2352-4642(19)30432-8; 10.1016/S2215-0366(17)30159-1; 10.1126/science.aay0214; 10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.104716; 10.1093/sf/60.1.248; 10.1136/bmj.n2061; 10.1007/978-981-10-2327-9_7; 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61124-7; 10.1017/S0033291721002506; 10.1007/s10804-009-9082-y; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2022.02.011; 10.7189/jogh.11.04066; 10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004661","We declare no competing interests.","Centre for Global Mental Health, Health Service &amp; Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."

"37821942","Cost-effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination of children in China: a modeling analysis.","Qiang Wang, Huajie Jin, Liuqing Yang, Hui Jin, Leesa Lin","China has a high burden of influenza-associated illness among children. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing government-funded influenza vaccination to children in China (fully-funded policy) compared with the status quo (self-paid policy). A decision tree model was developed to calculate the economic and health outcomes, from a societal perspective, using national- and provincial-level data. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) [incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained] was used to compare the fully-funded policy with the self-paid policy under the willingness-to-pay threshold equivalent to national and provincial GDP per capita. Sensitivity analyses were performed and various scenarios were explored based on real-world conditions, including incorporating indirect effect into the analysis. Compared to the self-paid policy, implementation of a fully-funded policy could prevent 1,444,768 [95% uncertainty range (UR): 1,203,446-1,719,761] symptomatic cases, 92,110 (95% UR: 66,953-122,226) influenza-related hospitalizations, and 6494 (95% UR: 4590-8962) influenza-related death per season. The fully-funded policy was cost-effective nationally (7964 USD per QALY gained) and provincially for 13 of 31 provincial-level administrative divisions (PLADs). The probability of a funded vaccination policy being cost-effective was 56.5% nationally, and the probability in 9 of 31 PLADs was above 75%. The result was most sensitive to the symptomatic influenza rate among children under 5&#xa0;years [ICER ranging from -&#xa0;25,612 (cost-saving) to 14,532 USD per QALY gained]. The ICER of the fully-funded policy was substantially lower (becoming cost-saving) if the indirect effects of vaccination were considered. Introducing a government-funded influenza policy for children is cost-effective in China nationally and in many PLADs. PLADs with high symptomatic influenza rate and influenza-associated mortality would benefit the most from a government-funded influenza vaccination program.",2023,10,11,"Infectious diseases of poverty","10.1186/s40249-023-01144-6","PMC10566174","Infect Dis Poverty","eng","D002648; D002675; D006801; D002681; D003362; D007251; D019057; D012621; D014611; D005380; D007252","Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; China; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Influenza, Human; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Seasons; Vaccination; Financing, Government; Influenza Vaccines","AIR@InnoHK; KYCX20_0153; 3225002102D; 202106090165","10.1016/S2214-109X(19)30545-5; 10.1016/S2352-4642(18)30062-2; 10.1093/cid/ciz075; 10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.07.045; 10.3947/ic.2017.49.4.247; 10.3390/vaccines9030286; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.7423; 10.1080/21645515.2020.1772620; 10.1371/journal.pone.0073724; 10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.10.045; 10.1186/s12916-020-01545-6; 10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.10.013; 10.1186/s12879-018-3422-0; 10.1136/bmj.i1750; 10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106423; 10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.02.032; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2017.3879; 10.1186/s12879-016-1614-z; 10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30264-3; 10.3390/vaccines8010007; 10.1111/irv.12419; 10.1016/j.pedneo.2021.05.002; 10.1016/S2468-2667(19)30163-X; 10.1136/bmj.f5061; 10.1186/s12916-021-02049-7; 10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.04.008; 10.1186/1741-7015-11-153; 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-9624.2019.10.007; 10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.12.075; 10.1186/s40249-015-0077-6; 10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.06.035; 10.1186/s12879-017-2801-2; 10.1186/s12955-019-1109-x; 10.1016/j.jval.2016.02.017; 10.1056/NEJMoa055414; 10.1001/jama.2010.250; 10.1093/cid/cix420; 10.1186/s12879-017-2399-4; 10.1371/journal.pone.0087590; 10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.01.006; 10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.01.015; 10.1016/j.jval.2020.10.011","All authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, WC1E 7TH, UK."

Clinical guidelines recommend 6-12&#xa0;months of DAPT, depending on stent type, clinical picture and patient factors. Our hypothesis is that a nanostructured noble metal coating has the potential to reduce protein deposition and platelet activation. These effects would reduce subsequent thrombo-inflammatory reactions, potentially mitigating the need for an extensive DAPT in the acute phase. Here, a noble metal nanostructure coating on stents is investigated. Twelve pigs underwent endovascular implantation of coated and non-coated stents for paired comparisons in a blinded study design. The non-coated control stent was placed at the contralateral corresponding artery. Volumetric analysis of angiographic data, performed by a treatment blinded assessor, demonstrated a significant thrombus reduction for one of the coatings compared to control. This effect was already seen one hour after implantation. This finding was supported by in vitro data showing a significant reduction of coagulation activation in the coated group. This novel coating shows promise as an implant material addition and could potentially decrease the need for DAPT in the early phases of stent implementation.",2023,10,11,"Scientific reports","10.1038/s41598-023-44364-4","PMC10567768","Sci Rep","eng","D006801; D000818; D013552; D010975; D003324; D054855; D015607; D013927; D015539; D016896; D004359; D062645","Humans; Animals; Swine; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Coronary Artery Disease; Drug-Eluting Stents; Stents; Thrombosis; Platelet Activation; Treatment Outcome; Drug Therapy, Combination; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention",NA,"10.1016/j.actbio.2019.06.021; 10.3389/fbioe.2018.00099; 10.1016/j.pcad.2017.12.004; 10.1016/j.jacc.2016.03.513; 10.1016/j.jcin.2014.05.016; 10.1016/j.actbio.2019.06.019; 10.1002/jbm.a.34714; 10.15420/ecr.2018:8:2; 10.1016/j.actbio.2019.06.020; 10.1002/jbm.b.33403; 10.1002/jbm.b.34041; 10.1021/am900028e; 10.1016/s0934-8840(11)80203-3; 10.1186/s13756-021-00907-w; 10.1016/j.enfi.2014.10.004; 10.1186/s12871-015-0156-z; 10.1093/ilar.43.4.244; 10.1038/s41598-022-12564-z; 10.1177/1756287219854915; 10.1186/s13613-021-00961-y; 10.1038/s41569-018-0118-5; 10.1016/s0002-9149(00)01159-0; 10.4065/81.5.641; 10.1016/S0049-3848(98)00198-4; 10.1002/phar.2228; 10.1159/000338054; 10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.10.039; 10.1056/NEJMra011883; 10.1182/blood.V71.4.932.932; 10.1182/blood.V55.1.156.156; 10.1177/18479804211062316; 10.1016/j.actbio.2015.01.036; 10.1039/B716509A; 10.1021/ja056278e; 10.1016/j.mseb.2008.06.007; 10.1089/ten.TEA.2012.0772; 10.1021/la011011o; 10.1177/0885328217748465; 10.1016/j.actbio.2019.08.042; 10.1021/cr020377i; 10.1016/j.steroids.2014.07.018; 10.1016/j.thromres.2011.03.013; 10.1016/j.actbio.2019.06.022; 10.1586/erc.11.40; 10.1111/joim.12296; 10.1097/MCA.0b013e32832cff1f; 10.18433/jpps30456; 10.1002/adfm.202005361; 10.1038/s41569-019-0234-x; 10.1002/adma.202201971","Authors J.S and B.S have a pending patent application for the coating technology utilized in this work.

"37814220","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and socioeconomic determinants in an Iranian cohort study.","Zahra Sadeghianpour, Bahman Cheraghian, Hamid Reza Farshchi, Mohsen Asadi-Lari","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is widespread worldwide. On the other hand, social inequality and socioeconomic status (SES) can affect all aspects of health. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between SES indicators and NAFLD. This was a cross-sectional study using data from the registration phase of the Hoveyzeh Cohort Study, which included 10,009 individuals aged 35-70&#xa0;years from May 2016 to August 2018. Fatty liver disease was determined based on Fatty Liver Index (FLI). The crude and adjusted odds ratios were calculated by logistic regression analysis to estimate associations between the fatty liver index and SES after controlling the potential confounders. According to the FLI index, there were 2,006 people with fatty liver (28%) and 5,246 people without fatty liver (72%). Several 4496 people (62%) were women. The chi-square test showed significant relationships between the educational level and skill level (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), the wealth index (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and&#xa0;Townsend Index&#xa0;(P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) with fatty liver index. In multivariable analysis, after adjustment for age, sex, physical activity, smoking, type of residence, calorie intake, dyslipidemia, skill level, and diabetes, the wealth index (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) was positively associated with the fatty liver index.

However, very little work has examined differences in white matter in adolescents at familial risk for depression. In a sample aged 9-14 (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;117), we used tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to examine differences in white matter microstructure between adolescents with (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;42) and without (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;75) maternal history of depression. Microstructure was indexed using fractional anisotropy (FA). Threshold-free cluster enhancement was applied and cluster maps were thresholded at whole-brain family-wise error &lt;&#xa0;.05. There was no significant main effect of risk status on FA. However, there was a significant interaction between risk status and age, such that large and diffuse portions of the white matter skeleton showed relatively increased FA with age for youth with a maternal history of depression compared to those without. Most tracts identified by the interaction were robust to controlling for sex, youth internalizing, in-scanner motion, neighborhood SES, and intra-cranial volume, evidence that maternal depression is a unique predictor of white matter alterations in youth.

To date, studies addressing this theme mainly focused on school children and rarely accounted for sleep, with a cross-country perspective. We aimed at comparing lifestyle patterns among preschool-aged children across Europe, their associations with socio-demographic factors and their links with body mass index (BMI). Harmonized data on 2-5-year-olds participating in nine European birth cohorts from the EU Child Cohort Network were used (EBRBs, socio-demographics and anthropometrics). Principal component analysis and multivariable linear and logistic regressions were performed. The most consistent pattern identified across cohorts was defined by at least three of the following EBRBs: discretionary consumption, high screen time, low outdoor play time and low sleep duration. Consistently, children from low-income households and born to mothers with low education level had higher scores on this pattern compared to their socioeconomically advantaged counterparts.

Evidence on ASHAs has focused on workplace challenges from a system perspective, without sufficient probing into individual-level stress. This study aims to gain perspectives into the experiences of work stress, the related health symptoms, and the responses to stress among ASHAs in India. Focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted with ASHAs in Sehore district, Madhya Pradesh, were audio-recorded and transcribed. Grounded theory was used to generate themes under the various domains of ASHAs' work and domestic life. We identified pathways between the conditions that trigger stressful events, experiences of these events, resulting perceptions, effects on health and wellbeing, and approaches used by ASHAs to respond to stress. Six FGDs with 59 ASHAs generated the following themes: (a) Facility: Workload, undue pressures, unstructured work; ASHAs' relationships with seniors (e.g., feelings of being disrespected, blamed, or targeted), and low access to physical and administrative resources; (b) Home: Feelings of guilt for putting less time for family/child care; disrespect by the elderly for a poorly incentivised job; (c) Community: Low acceptance by the villagers; caste- and gender-bias; difficult community-level relationships (emotional labour, fear/stigma towards her services); (d) Somatic and psychological symptoms: headache, exhaustion, depressive symptoms (to cite a few); and (e) Responses to stress: Motivation (support from peers, family, a sense of identity/pride, incentives), Individual strengths (e.g., social responsibility), and spiritual recourse mechanisms.

Data were analyzed from 781 veterans who participated National Veteran Homeless and Other Poverty Experiences (NV-HOPE) study conducted in 2021. Chi-square tests, analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and logistic regressions analyses were conducted to examine unadjusted and adjusted associations between gambling group status and sociodemographic, psychiatric, substance use, functioning, and homelessness measures. A significant minority of low-income U.S. veterans reported gambling, with 24.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 95% CI 21.12-28.76%) exhibiting RG and 6.7% (95% CI 3.88-9.42%) screening positive for ARPG. The prevalence of ARPG was higher among younger, non-White veterans. ARPG was associated with greater symptoms of substance use and anxiety; poorer physical functioning; history of any mental illness; lifetime history of homelessness; and having any student or car loans relative to NG. Veterans who had RG were more likely to screen positive for drug use disorders relative to NG. Results of the current study provide an up-to-date estimate of the current prevalence of RG and ARPG among low-income U.S. veterans and underscore the importance of routine screening, monitoring, and development of interventions for problematic gambling severity, as well as interventions for ARPG in this population.

Eating competence represents a variety of contextual skills reflecting a comfortable and flexible approach to eating and is associated with diet quality and health related behavior. In non-pregnant samples, perceived stress is negatively associated with eating competence. Given that pregnancy and the postpartum period can be periods of high stress, we hypothesized that higher stress in pregnancy would result in lower pregnancy eating competence.

We studied 526 children of various Asian nationalities in Singapore (46.6% female, 13.4% below the poverty line) with longitudinal data on perinatal and childhood experiences, maternal report on empathic concern of the child, and a comprehensive set of physiological measures reflecting pediatric allostatic load assessed at 6 y of age. The perinatal and childhood experiences included adversities and positive experiences. We found that cumulative adverse childhood experience was positively associated with allostatic load of children at 6 y of age at higher levels of empathic concern but not significantly associated at lower levels of empathic concern. This finding reveals evidence for the importance of empathic concern as a psychological characteristic that moderates the developmental impact of environmental influences, serving as a source for vulnerability to adversities in children.",2023,9,26,"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","10.1073/pnas.2217769120","PMC10523447","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","eng","D011247; D006801; D002648; D005260; D008297; D052636; D000076783; D001213; D004645; D005190","Pregnancy; Humans; Child; Female; Male; Allostasis; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Asian; Empathy; Family",NA,"10.1007/s40615-020-00757-z","M.J.M. and W.T.B. coauthored one review article in 2021 and one review article in 2022.","Translational Neuroscience Programme, Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences (SICS), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore 117609, Republic of Singapore."
"37706103","Neuroscience Engagement and Outreach on Neurodevelopmental Disorders: A Report from India.","Divya Bhatia","The current project was funded by the Global Engagement Seed Grant from the International Brain Research Organisation (IBRO) as part of the IBRO-led Global Engagement Initiative. The project was focused on public awareness about neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) as well as neuroscience engagement. Thus, the project had two specific aims: (a) public awareness about epidemiology, diagnosis, risk factors, prevention of NDDs and relevant government guidelines and available policies (b) public engagement in neuroscience. Therefore, the current project report with an emphasis on the requirement of neuroscience engagement and outreach at the societal level, highlights several activities such as population-based workshops and webinars, carried out as part of the project in both rural and urban areas to enhance the public engagement in neuroscience and awareness on several NDDs. India is an extremely diverse country with significant variations in cultural, educational, financial, socioeconomic status and linguistic aspects. With about 27% of its population living below the poverty line, India accounts for about 23 million children suffering from a disability, most of whom do not seek medical help. These data highlight the gravity of the situation which calls for urgent actions from governments, healthcare professionals, researchers and policymakers to design adequate public awareness programs regarding several prevalent NDDs. Therefore, the current project was an effort to bring public awareness about brain health and the epidemiology, diagnosis and prevention of NDDs and relevant government guidelines and available policies.",2023,4,1,"Annals of neurosciences","10.1177/09727531231176122","PMC10496791","Ann Neurosci","eng",NA,NA,NA,"NA","The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.","E-Cog: Emotion &amp; Cognition Psychology Research Centre, Jindal School of Psychology and Counselling, O.P.

This study aimed to determine the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on childhood cancer survival using pooled South African data. Five databases spanning January 2000 to December 2021 were interrogated. SES status was assigned based on a public sector annual household income classification. H0 households (formally unemployed) received free healthcare. H1, H2 and H3 (annual income &gt; United States Dollar [USD] 19,000) households paid for healthcare relative to their income. The Spearman test assessed correlations between SES and disease stage in patients with solid tumours. Hazard ratios were determined using Cox regression modelling. The Kaplan-Meier procedure estimated overall survival (OS). A total of 1598 children were eligible for analysis; 1269 had a solid tumour with a negative correlation between SES and stage (Spearman rho&#xa0;=&#xa0;-.178; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001). Patients with solid tumours and lower SES showed proportionately higher numbers of stage III and IV disease (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.01). This proportion decreased with higher SES categories. In the multivariate analyses adjusted for sex, age, tumour type and stage, higher SES was associated with lower mortality risk (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001), indicating that the impact of SES on survival was in excess of any effect that could be explained by lower stage disease alone. There was a strong positive correlation between race and SES (Fisher's exact tests, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001) across all groups and all SES strata. Five-year OS was 85.3% in children from H3 households versus 46.3% in children from H0 households (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001). SES significantly impacts childhood cancer survival for children with solid tumours in South Africa. SES is a robust surrogate for race in South Africa as a prognostic metric of disease outcome in childhood cancer. Advocacy to increase social support for impoverished patients is essential to achieve equitable improvements in outcomes treated with standardised national treatment guidelines.",2023,12,1,"Pediatric blood &amp; cancer","10.1002/pbc.30669",NA,"Pediatr Blood Cancer","eng",NA,NA,"CSUR180429324830","NA",NA,"Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Paediatric Haematology Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Stellenbosch, Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa."

However, little is known about neurocognitive tests used in people with depression in LMIC. We aimed to investigate cognitive performance and cognitive tests in depression research in LMIC. APA PsycInfo, Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, and Global Health were systematically searched for studies that implemented a cognitive performance test in a depressed, LMIC population. Tool quality was assessed using an adapted scale for quality of measures in cross-cultural settings. Data extracted included demographics, depression and cognitive performance measures, and cognitive performance comparisons between depression and control groups. 29 studies met eligibility criteria, involving a total of 19,100 participants from 11 LMIC. 93.1&#xa0;% of studies were conducted in upper middle-income countries. 67 cognitive performance tools were implemented. Reliability was reported for 5.6&#xa0;% of cognitive performance tests and validity was reported for 8.3&#xa0;%. 36.1&#xa0;% of tests used were culturally adapted. 75.9&#xa0;% of included studies implemented at least one memory test. Cognitive deficits were observed in all depressed groups, especially in memory (Cohen's d&#xa0;=&#xa0;-1.60, 95&#xa0;% CI -2.02 to -1.18). Heterogeneity between studies; averaged results across memory subtypes; no assessment of depression severity and cognitive deficits associations; restrictive search terms. Cognitive impairments in depression, especially in memory, are prevalent in LMIC. This research has drawn attention to the burden of cognitive dysfunction in depression in LMIC, and to the disparate research gap in LMIC.

The underlying mechanism may involve hypofunction of the NMDA receptor. We investigated whether schizophrenia-related pathway polygenic scores, composed of genetic variants within NMDA receptor encoding genes, are associated with cortical glutamate in schizophrenia. Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) glutamate was measured in 70 participants across 4 research sites using Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS). Two NMDA receptor gene sets were sourced from the Molecular Signatories Database and NMDA receptor pathway polygenic scores were constructed using PRSet. The NMDA receptor pathway polygenic scores were weighted by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and associations with ACC glutamate were tested. We then tested whether NMDA receptor pathway polygenic scores with SNPs weighted by associations with non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia were associated with ACC glutamate. A higher NMDA receptor complex pathway polygenic score was significantly associated with lower ACC glutamate (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.25, 95&#xa0;% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.49, -0.02, competitive p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.03). When SNPs were weighted by associations with non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia, there was no association between the NMDA receptor complex pathway polygenic score and ACC glutamate (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.05, 95&#xa0;% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.18, 0.27, competitive p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.79). These results provide initial evidence of an association between common genetic variation implicated in NMDA receptor function and ACC glutamate levels in schizophrenia.

Developing new therapies is therefore crucial to address patient needs. To this end, we focused on galectin-3 (Gal-3), a lectin known to be associated with several pathological processes seen in SSc. Using RNA sequencing of whole-blood samples in a cross-sectional cohort of 249 patients with SSc, Gal-3 and its interactants defined a strong transcriptomic fingerprint associated with disease severity, pulmonary and cardiac malfunctions, neutrophilia and lymphopenia. We developed new Gal-3 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAb), which were then evaluated in a mouse model of hypochlorous acid (HOCl)-induced SSc. We show that two of these antibodies, D11 and E07, reduced pathological skin thickening, lung and skin collagen deposition, pulmonary macrophage content, and plasma interleukin-5 and -6 levels. Moreover, E07 changed the transcriptional profiles of HOCl-treated mice, resulting in a gene expression pattern that resembled that of control mice. Similarly, pathological pathways engaged in patients with SSc were counteracted by E07 in mice.

Poverty and low educational attainment are intriguingly associated with poor awareness and perception of these diseases that add to the suffering. Poverty goes parallel with a low level of education and is intricately associated with neuropsychiatric ailments, which have the potential to spread transgenerationally. Robust education policies, proper government rules and regulations against the spread of disease-related myths and misconceptions, uplifting medical education in its true sense, voices against consanguinity, and programs to raise scientific perception about diseases can help to throw light at the end of this dark tunnel. In this article, the authors intend to 1) decipher the potential psychosocial basis of human suffering and poverty in patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders, and 2) discuss the apropos way-outs that would potentially mitigate suffering, and alleviate the economic burden and cognitive disabilities of families with neuropsychiatric diseases.",2023,5,1,"Medical research archives","10.18103/mra.v11i5.3919","PMC10461571","Med Res Arch","eng",NA,NA,"R01 NS039422","10.31887/DCNS.2018.20.3/mhoehe; 10.1111/ane.12232; 10.1016/S1474-4422(19)30043-2; 10.1080/14737159.2017.1335598; 10.1097/WCO.0000000000000319; 10.1093/brain/awt035; 10.1016/j.gde.2020.05.032; 10.1016/j.nbd.2020.105088; 10.1007/s13311-018-00694-0; 10.1172/JCI24761; 10.1016/B978-0-12-802395-2.00021-3; 10.1007/s00439-017-1843-; 10.1038/ng.3572; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2020.01.023; 10.1111/andr.12700; 10.1007/s10567-021-00355-3; 10.1017/S0954579413000680; 10.2147/AHMT.S237807; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2013.01.026; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.106966; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2005.03.006; 10.1017/S0012162206001253; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.0154; 10.1016/j.ridd.2017.10.022; 10.1111/jar.12337; 10.1016/j.jaac.2013.07.011; 10.1017/S0033291721001951; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2014.13101306; 10.1007/s12402-014-0146-x; 10.1016/S2215-0366(16)30376-5; 10.1038/s41380-019-0350-3; 10.1186/s12913-020-05683-8; 10.1080/17482631.2020.1725362; 10.1097/ACM.0000000000000530; 10.1097/ACM.0000000000000531; 10.1017/s0317167100009082; 10.1016/j.neurol.2021.01.021; 10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102601; 10.1093/brain/awx341; 10.1371/journal.pbio.3000946; 10.3389/fpubh.2021.535737; 10.1136/jech.2007.068031; 10.3390/ijerph18042007; 10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.126; 10.1017/S1461145711001982; 10.1177/1039856212459587; 10.1038/s41380-017-0010-4; 10.1159/000505330; 10.1016/j.seizure.2021.11.021; 10.1002/mds.28575; 10.1037/per0000268; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.03.039; 10.1186/s41983-022-00538-x; 10.1080/07370016.2018.1404832; 10.1007/s10964-021-01427-x; 10.2105/AJPH.2004.055921; 10.1186/s12889-021-10176-2; 10.3390/ijerph8093528; 10.3390/ijerph19116918; 10.2196/30388; 10.1002/hbm.25562; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03544.x; 10.1037/adb0000471; 10.1037/abn0000711; 10.1007/s10339-021-01029-2; 10.1016/s0899-3289(99)00002-4; 10.1016/j.dsx.2020.06.008; 10.1016/j.cpr.2006.01.009; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2015.10.012; 10.1016/j.jad.2019.06.064; 10.29399/npa.22655; 10.1007/s10578-019-00938-w; 10.1016/j.psychres.2017.10.044; 10.1016/j.jbtep.2011.09.008; 10.18103/mra.v10i3.2707; 10.1136/jme.2003.007062; 10.1186/s12939-018-0748-6; 10.1007/s12664-020-01056-5; 10.1186/1472-6939-5-5; 10.1086/381709; 10.1016/j.actatropica.2009.08.019; 10.1111/j.1875-595X.2012.00123x; 10.1192/bjp.bp.108.050187; 10.4103/ijcm.ijcm_997_21; 10.1007/s10943-021-01466-5; 10.20529/IJME.2008.054; 10.1111/j.1525-1497.2006.00642.x; 10.1097/ACM.0000000000003765; 10.1186/s12904-018-0360-y; 10.1017/mdh.2018.23; 10.1111/medu.14074; 10.1111/j.1525-1497.2006.00646.x; 10.7748/ncyp.2022.e1416; 10.1126/science.aat7615; 10.3390/jcm10112479; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107300; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2016.04.003; 10.1016/j.healthpol.2018.05.012; 10.1177/0883073821991300; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.108260; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107638; 10.2147/AHMT.S175765; 10.1007/s00787-016-0873-y; 10.1007/s10519-020-10006-y; 10.1186/s40359-021-00633-3; 10.1097/YCO.0000000000000701; 10.1155/2021/6667006; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2011.07.031; 10.1146/annurev-neuro-071714-034136; 10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.02.006; 10.1016/j.prdoa.2020.100038; 10.1038/s41398-018-0204-9; 10.3389/fneur.2018.00491; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.0350; 10.1001/jama.291.3.358; 10.1007/s00127-015-1072-8; 10.1002/da.23277; 10.1186/s13229-018-0193-9; 10.1136/bmjgh-2019-002026; 10.1080/23288604.2020.1833639; 10.1007/s001150050653; 10.3233/JHD-190382; 10.1007/s11920-019-1017-0; 10.1377/hlthaff.2016.0605; 10.1111/bioe.12357; 10.1186/s40659-016-0070-y; 10.1016/j.tics.2016.10.008; 10.5114/ninp.2013.39069; 10.1016/j.rcp.2017.05.001; 10.1055/s-0042-1745741; 10.1097/ACM.0000000000001003; 10.1007/s40596-014-0112-0; 10.1007/s40596-014-0045-7; 10.1007/s40596-014-0049-3; 10.1176/appi.focus.20180033; 10.4103/0973-1229.109282; 10.1176/jnp.1.2.173; 10.1080/17470919.2016.1245214; 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.17100200; 10.31887/DCNS.2018.20.2/gfricchione; 10.1353/pbm.2010.0012; 10.1159/000447359; 10.30773/pi.2021.0258; 10.1176/appi.ajp.159.5.695; 10.1007/s00406-007-0783-6; 10.1016/j.mehy.2005.05.007; 10.1016/j.psychres.2016.04.042; 10.1017/S2045796016000949; 10.1177/070674371205700804; 10.1016/j.cpr.2011.05.003","We wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication, and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome.","Department of Neurology, University Hospital ""12 de Octubre"", Madrid, Spain."

Furthermore, there is evidence that block construction training is particularly beneficial for improving early mathematics skills in children from low-Socio Economic Status (SES) groups who are known to have lower maths performance than their peers. The current study investigates (a) the association between block construction and mathematics in children just before the start of formal schooling (4 years-of-age in the UK) and (b) whether the association between block construction and mathematics differs between children from more compared to less affluent families. Participants in this study included 116 children (M = 3 years 11 months, SD = 3 months) who all completed numeracy, block construction, and receptive vocabulary tasks. Socio-economic status and demographic information (child age, gender, ethnicity) were also obtained from parents. Findings show a strong positive association between block construction and early numeracy skills. Block construction skills explained approximately 5% of the variation in numeracy, even after controlling for age in months, household income, and child receptive vocabulary. When separated by SES group, for children from less affluent families, block construction explained a significant amount of variability (14.5%) in numeracy performance after covariates. For children from more affluent families, block construction did not explain a significant amount of variation in numeracy. These findings suggest that, interventions involving block construction skills may help to reduce SES-based attainment gaps in UK children's mathematics achievement.",2023,8,10,"Journal of Intelligence","10.3390/jintelligence11080161","PMC10455495","J Intell","eng",NA,NA,"Incubator Fund; Undergraduate Research Bursary.","10.1037/dev0000899; 10.1080/15248372.2020.1741363; 10.5951/TCM.10.2.0098; 10.1016/j.lindif.2011.11.008; 10.1080/07370000802177177; 10.1542/peds.109.4.634; 10.1177/1476718X18762238; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2012.01.002; 10.1542/peds.109.6.1028; 10.1111/rssa.12128; 10.1186/1479-5868-10-102; 10.1111/j.1751-228X.2011.01122.x; 10.1007/s00426-018-1008-5; 10.1111/desc.12786; 10.1016/j.jecp.2017.04.016; 10.1016/j.learninstruc.2020.101417; 10.1007/s11121-007-0070-9; 10.3758/s13423-019-01694-7; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.05.007; 10.1016/j.cogpsych.2018.12.002; 10.1111/bjep.12211; 10.1037/fam0000450; 10.1177/0956797614563338; 10.1016/j.cognition.2021.104918; 10.31234/osf.io/tjb6f; 10.1037/0012-1649.35.4.940; 10.1037/a0025913; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01623.x; 10.2307/1130467; 10.1111/cdev.13933; 10.1037/xge0000182; 10.1016/j.learninstruc.2014.01.006; 10.1111/cdep.12389; 10.1016/j.tine.2020.100146; 10.1037/edu0000079; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2015.12.020; 10.17105/SPR44-1.41-59; 10.1016/j.appdev.2014.05.005; 10.2466/22.24.PMS.119c28z8; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2018.04.006; 10.1111/cogs.13081; 10.1016/S0277-9536(02)00131-4; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2018.07.008; 10.1007/s10643-014-0644-7; 10.1016/j.jecp.2014.02.012; 10.1016/j.tine.2014.02.005; 10.1111/cdev.12165; 10.1037/a0016127; 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.563493","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","Centre for Educational Neuroscience, Birkbeck, University of London, London WC1H 0AL, UK."

The indicators of social policy were extracted from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development database (OECD). The probability of ADw/oD with moderate AD brain pathology was inversely associated with the Gini index for disposable income, poverty rate, and certain public expenditures on healthcare.

Forty percent of the NTD-affected people live in Africa with the poorest, most vulnerable, and hard to reach geographical areas. The NTDs cause significant social and economic burden and deepen marginalization and stigmatization. The World Health Organization's current roadmap for NTD aims to prevent, control, eliminate, or eradicate 20 tropical diseases. Ethiopia experiences a high burden of these diseases, but current access to diagnostics, medicine, and/or care has been little explored to inform the country's NTD strategic plan. The overall purpose of the scoping review was to map and characterize the burden of NTDs and challenges in access to diagnostics, medicine, and/or care in Ethiopia. A systematic search of evidence was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from January 2000 until May 2022, without restrictions of language or study design. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Review was followed for screening of studies. Key findings were extracted and narrated qualitatively. The search resulted in 4532 articles, of which 105 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the scoping review under three themes: burden of NTDs, access to diagnostics, medicine and/or care, and key barriers. Although gains have been made in the prevention and control of NTDs in Ethiopia, the burden remains high, and progress in access to diagnostics, medicine/drugs, and/or care is very slow. Poverty, poor quality of life, and underfunding of NTD programs decelerate the process of NTD elimination program in the country. The scoping review identified a considerable number of studies on the burden of NTDs in Ethiopia and strategies for diagnosis, treatment, and/or care; however, there is a paucity of evidence on the suitability and potential benefits of novel diagnostic technologies and medicines in the country. A regular review and analysis of such country-level evidence is important to inform the country NTDs roadmap and local implementation strategies.",2023,8,14,"Systematic reviews","10.1186/s13643-023-02302-5","PMC10424375","Syst Rev","eng","D006801; D005002; D011788; D014330; D014943; D058069; D006297","Humans; Ethiopia; Quality of Life; Tropical Medicine; Global Health; Neglected Diseases; Health Services Accessibility","221576/Z/20/Z","10.1007/s40121-020-00361-y; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008319; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0009379; 10.1186/s13071-021-04600-0; 10.1016/j.parepi.2021.e00210; 10.1016/j.fawpar.2020.e00089; 10.1186/s13071-020-04317-6; 10.1371/journal.pone.0243863; 10.1186/s13104-019-4317-x; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008120; 10.1016/j.inhe.2011.03.004; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008882; 10.1371/journal.pone.0235281; 10.1002/central/CN-02201675/full","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Centre for Innovative Drug Development and Therapeutic Trials for Africa (CDT-Africa), College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia."

Evidence from twin studies has shown that family SES moderates genetic and environmental influences on child mental health. However, it is also known that SES is itself under genetic influence and previous gene-environment interaction (G&#xd7;E) studies have not incorporated the potential genetic overlap between child mental health and family SES into G&#xd7;E analyses. We applied a novel approach using extended family data to investigate the moderation of aetiological influences on child emotional and behavioural problems by parental socioeconomic status in the presence of modelled gene-environment correlation. The sample comprised &gt;28,100 children in extended-family units drawn from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Mothers reported children's emotional and behavioural symptoms. Parents' income and educational attainment were obtained through linkage to administrative register data. Bivariate moderation Multiple-Children-of-Twins-and-Siblings (MCoTS) models were used to analyse relationships between offspring outcomes (emotional and behavioural symptom scores) and parental socioeconomic moderators (income rank and educational attainment). The aetiology of child emotional symptoms was moderated by maternal and paternal educational attainment. Shared environmental influences on child emotional symptoms were greater at lower levels of parents' education. The aetiology of child behavioural symptoms was moderated by maternal, but not paternal, socioeconomic factors. Genetic factors shared between maternal income and child behavioural symptoms were greater in families with lower levels maternal income. Nonshared environmental influences on child behavioural symptoms were greater in families with higher maternal income and education.

Children ages 5 to 14 years who had experienced TBI were recruited from consecutive hospital admissions. Soon after injury, participants were assessed for preinjury characteristics, including psychiatric disorders, socioeconomic status (SES), psychosocial adversity, and family function, and the presence and location of lesions were documented by MRI. Psychiatric outcomes, including novel oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, were assessed 24 months after injury. Of the children without preinjury oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, or disruptive behavior disorder not otherwise specified who were recruited in this study, 165 were included in this sample; 95 of these children returned for the 24-month assessment. Multiple imputation was used to address attrition. The prevalence of novel oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder was 23.7 out of 165 (14%). In univariable analyses, novel oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder was significantly associated with psychosocial adversity (p=0.049) and frontal white matter lesions (p=0.016) and was marginally but not significantly associated with SES. In the final multipredictor model, frontal white matter lesions were significantly associated with novel oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder (p=0.021), and psychosocial adversity score was marginally but not significantly associated with the outcome. The odds ratio of novel oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder among the children with versus those without novel depressive disorder was significantly higher for girls than boys (p=0.025), and the odds ratio of novel oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder among the children with versus those without novel attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was significantly higher for boys than girls (p=0.006). Approximately 14% of children with TBI developed oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder. The risk for novel oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder can be understood from a biopsychosocial perspective.

As social support helps to buffer these problems, we investigated the association between job loss related to COVID-19 and depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts; the differences in the effects according to SES; and the mediating effects of social support. The effects of COVID-19-related job loss on depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts among 1,364 people were investigated through semi-structured and self-administered questionnaires: Patient Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Disorder-7, and the Functional Social Support Questionnaire. Logistic regression and subgroup analyses were performed to assess the association between job loss and mental health status, and the moderating effects of income and educational levels. Moreover, the mediating effects of perceived social support on the association between job loss and depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts were analyzed. COVID-19-related job loss increased the risk of depression and suicidal thoughts. Adults with lower income and education level were at higher risk of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts; perceived social support level had significant mediating effects on the association between job loss and depression/anxiety; and income level had significant moderating effects on this mediating pathway. COVID-19-related job loss were likely to be significantly associated with negative mental health outcomes, especially among individuals with low income and education levels.

"37557972","Higher subjective socioeconomic status is linked to increased charitable giving and mentalizing-related neural value coding.","Stefan Schulreich, Anita Tusche, Philipp Kanske, Lars Schwabe","Socioeconomic status (SES), a concept related to an individual's economic and social position relative to others, can shape social interactions like altruistic behaviors. However, little is known about the exact neurocognitive mechanisms that link SES with altruism. Our study aimed to provide a comprehensive account of the sociocognitive and neural mechanisms through which SES affects charitable giving - an important variant of human altruism. To this end, participants completed a charitable donation task while their brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We also assessed participants' socio-cognitive ability to infer other people's mental states (i.e., mentalizing) - a driver of prosocial behavior - in an independent social task. Behaviorally, we found that both charitable giving and social cognition were status-dependent, as subjective SES positively predicted donations and mentalizing capacity. Moreover, the link between SES and charitable giving was mediated by individuals' mentalizing capacity. At the neural level, a multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data revealed that higher subjective SES was associated with stronger value coding in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ). The strength of this value representation predicted charitable giving and was linked to mentalizing. Furthermore, we observed an increased negative functional coupling between rTPJ and left putamen with higher SES. Together, increased charitable giving in higher-status individuals could be explained by status-dependent recruitment of mentalizing-related value coding and altered functional connectivity in the brain. Our findings provide insights into the socio- and neurocognitive mechanisms explaining why and when higher SES leads to prosociality, which might ultimately inform targeted interventions to promote prosocial behavior in human societies.",2023,10,1,"NeuroImage","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2023.120315",NA,"Neuroimage","eng","D006801; D000076563; D001921; D000533; D001931; D012923; D008279; D056345","Humans; Mentalization; Brain; Altruism; Brain Mapping; Social Class; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Theory of Mind",NA,"NA","Declaration of Competing Interest None.","Department of Cognitive Psychology, Faculty of Psychology and Human Movement Science, Universit&#xe4;t Hamburg, Hamburg 20146, Germany."

However, the association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and educational level remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether there is an independent relationship between NAFLD and educational level as a surrogate marker for socioeconomic status (SES). This cross-sectional study included 8,727 participants from the Paracelsus 10,000 study. The association between NAFLD and educational level was assessed using multivariable logistic regression models and multivariable linear regression. The primary endpoints were NAFLD (FLI score &gt; 60) and liver fibrosis (FIB-4 score &gt; 1.29). Further subgroup analysis with liver stiffness measurement was done. In the study, NAFLD prevalence was 23% among participants with high education, 33% among intermediate, and 40% among those with low education (p&lt;0.01). Importantly, a significantly reduced risk of NAFLD was observed in individuals with higher education, as indicated by an adjusted relative risk of 0.52 (p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, higher education level was associated with significantly lower odds of NAFLD and fibrosis. Additionally, a subgroup analysis revealed that higher liver stiffness measurements were independently associated with lower levels of education. The study's findings indicate that a lower education level increases the risk of NAFLD independent of confounding factors. Therefore, these findings highlight the potential impact of educational attainment on NAFLD risk and emphasize the need for targeted interventions in vulnerable populations.",2023,12,1,"European journal of internal medicine","10.1016/j.ejim.2023.07.039",NA,"Eur J Intern Med","eng","D006801; D065626; D012307; D003430; D008103; D004522","Humans; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Risk Factors; Cross-Sectional Studies; Liver Cirrhosis; Educational Status",NA,"NA","Declaration of Competing Interest E.T. has received personal fees from Arvelle Therapeutics, Inc., Argenx, Bial, Biogen, Biocodex, B&#xf6;hringer Ingelheim, Eisai, Epilog, Everpharma, GlaxoSmithKline, GW Pharma, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, LivaNova PLC, Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Medtronic, NewBridge Pharmaceuticals, Novartis, Sandoz, Sanofi, Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Takeda, UCB Pharma, and Xenon; grants from Austrian Science Fund (FWF), Bayer, Biogen, Eisai, European Union, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, &#xd6;sterreichische Nationalbank, Red Bull, and UCB Pharma; He is CEO of NeuroConsult GmbH.; and has been a trial investigator for Eisai, GlaxoSmithKline, Marinus, Pfizer, and UCB Pharma; none COI related to the study.

Contingency management (CM) is a treatment for substance use disorders that has shown to be effective in eliciting behaviour change. The efficacy of CM interventions in low and middle income countries (LMICs) has been under explored. The aim of this systematic review of randomized controlled trials was to assess measures of CM efficacy in addressing substance use disorders, while also considering contextual moderators of CM in LMICs. A search of PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane library databases yielded 18 studies for inclusion, from which relevant data were extracted using modified versions of the Cochrane Characteristics of Studies tool. Two studies were located in a low-income country, two in lower-middle income countries, and fourteen in upper middle-income countries. Overall, estimated efficacy estimates were similar to those from higher income countries. However, context-specific challenges that warrant further investigation included limited access to trained staff and structural and financial constraints. While CM in LMICs is in its early stages of development, efficacy estimates were not substantially different compared to high income countries.

"37511796","Pharmacogenomics and the Management of Mood Disorders-A Review.","Kristian Kleine Schaars, Roos van Westrhenen","Due to the chronic relapsing nature of mental disorders and increased life expectancy, the societal burden of these non-communicable diseases will increase even further. Treatments for mental disorders, such as depression, are available, but their effect is limited due to patients' (genetic) heterogeneity, low treatment compliance and frequent side effects. In general, only one-third of the patients respond to treatment. Today, medication selection in psychiatry relies on a trial-and-error approach based mainly on physicians' experience. Pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing can help in this process by determining the person-specific genetic factors that may predict clinical response and side effects associated with genetic variants that impact drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters or drug targets. PGxis a discipline that investigates genetic factors that affect the absorption, metabolism, and transport of drugs, thereby affecting therapy outcome. These genetic factors can, among other things, lead to differences in the activity of enzymes that metabolize drugs. Studies in depressed patients show that genotyping of drug-metabolizing enzymes can increase the effectiveness of treatment, which could benefit millions of patients worldwide. This review highlights these studies, gives recommendations and provides future perspectives on how to proceed with PGx testing. Finally, it is recommended to consider genotyping for <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>CYP2C19</i>, when there is an indication (side effects or inefficacy).",2023,7,24,"Journal of personalized medicine","10.3390/jpm13071183","PMC10381396","J Pers Med","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.3109/07853890.2011.583675; 10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.141950; 10.1159/000430915; 10.1503/jpn.100059; 10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00094; 10.3389/fphar.2021.640032; 10.1002/cpt.147; 10.1038/s41431-023-01347-3; 10.1038/s41431-021-01004-7; 10.1038/s41397-022-00288-2; 10.2217/pgs.14.151; 10.1038/tp.2012.99; 10.1097/FPC.0b013e3283649b9a; 10.9758/cpn.2015.13.2.150; 10.1186/s12888-017-1412-1; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2017.09.024; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2019.01.003; 10.9758/cpn.2018.16.4.469; 10.1038/s41398-022-01847-8; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.12443; 10.3389/fnins.2019.00960; 10.1177/02698811211015224; 10.1002/da.23029; 10.1001/jama.2022.9805; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2011.01802.x; 10.1002/cpt.2122; 10.1016/S0140-6736(22)01841-4","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","Outpatient Clinic Pharmacogenetics, Parnassia Psychiatric Institute/PsyQ, Overschiestraat 57, 1062 HN Amsterdam, The Netherlands."

A growing knowledge of the biology of development and neuroscience has highlighted the importance of adverse environmental exposures, collectively termed adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on health outcomes. ACEs are associated with short-term, medium-term and long-term negative consequences for health and development and their effects may be multiplicative, especially during critical periods of sensitivity and developmental plasticity.

In this Review, we discuss the key mechanisms linking ACEs to health outcomes and consider promising strategies to prevent and mitigate their effects, highlighting evidence from programs in low-income and middle-income countries.

Because clinical symptoms are strongly correlated with tau aggregates, drug development and clinical diagnosis need cost-effective and accessible specific fluid biomarkers of tau aggregates; however, recent studies suggest that the fluid biomarkers currently available cannot specifically track tau aggregates. We show that the microtubule-binding region (MTBR) of tau containing the residue 243 (MTBR-tau243) is a new cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker specific for insoluble tau aggregates and compared it to multiple other phosphorylated tau measures (p-tau181, p-tau205, p-tau217 and p-tau231) in two independent cohorts (BioFINDER-2, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;448; and Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;219).

The common indicators of SES are income, education, and occupation statuses. Recently, researchers have used mixed measurements of SES, such as the MacArthur Scale. Numerous researches have proven the influence of SES on human development. Individuals who are less educated, have lower job status, and earn less or no income are at greater risk of poor health than their higher SES counterparts. SES has also been proven to influence life satisfaction, academic achievement, emotion regulation, cognitive function, and decision-making tendencies. SES has life span influence, which correlates with the level of cognition, rate of cognitive decline, and incidence of Alzheimer's disease among elderly individuals. Besides the individual level of SES, neighborhood SES can also affect cognitive function as an environmental factor. Low-SES individuals exhibit hypoactivation of the executive network and hyperactivation of the reward network, indicating low-SES individuals tend to focus more on monetary issues, while neglecting other non-monetary issues, which is consistent with the scarcity hypothesis.",2023,1,1,"Advances in experimental medicine and biology","10.1007/978-981-99-1627-6_6",NA,"Adv Exp Med Biol","eng","D006801; D000368; D012923; D012959; D007182; D003071; D000092886","Humans; Aged; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Income; Cognition; Low Socioeconomic Status",NA,"10.1016/j.copsyc.2017.06.018; 10.1353/dem.2000.0005; 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233; 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.18.1.341; 10.1016/S0277-9536(02)00073-4; 10.1037/0012-1649.40.3.367; 10.1111/1467-8624.00612; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00746.x; 10.1111/1467-8624.00469; 10.1146/annurev.psych.031809.130711; 10.3102/00346543075003417; 10.1016/S1053-5357(01)00118-4; 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00238; 10.1073/pnas.1308240110; 10.1126/science.1238041; 10.1037/0022-0167.51.1.3; 10.1001/jama.294.22.2879; 10.1037/0278-6133.19.6.586; 10.1097/01.psy.0000188434.52941.a0; 10.1159/000085307; 10.1093/ageing/19.2.91; 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2011.03499.x; 10.1001/archneurol.2007.27; 10.1159/000345036; 10.1038/nrn2897; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.01.021; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00542.x; 10.1037/0894-4105.22.3.293; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00807.x; 10.1162/jocn.2009.21101; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2004.03.011; 10.1093/scan/nsn003; 10.1093/scan/nsm013; 10.1093/cercor/bhz080; 10.3758/s13415-015-0371-6; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.3139; 10.4324/9780429501739; 10.1146/annurev-psych-010416-044224; 10.1016/S0006-8993(00)02950-4; 10.1037/a0024768; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01643.x; 10.1037/0278-6133.14.5.464; 10.1016/j.dcn.2016.10.003; 10.1126/science.1222426; 10.1007/s00213-012-2689-x; 10.1016/j.tics.2010.12.004; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1915-15.2015",NA,"State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Faculty of Psychology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China."
"37409864","[Theoretical and clinical implications of trauma].","Philippe Fossati","Usually, trauma is defined as exposure to an event that threatens death or induces serious injury or sexual violence. Beyond post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), trauma may increase the risk for severe mental disorders including mood disorders and psychotic disorder. PTSD, following exposure to a traumatic event, is strongly linked to dissociation. However, in contrast convergent findings indicated that, despite the relationship between peri-traumatic dissociation and later PTSD, many people who develop PTSD do not display dissociative responses in the acute phase after the event. Several risk factors are described for PTSD including previous history of traumatic event, previous mental disorders, genetic factors and gender. It is now proposed to distinguish PTSD with or without dissociative symptoms with some specific neural signature for each syndrome. Dissociation may also lead to change in cultural belief and worldview. According to the terror management theory (TMT), it is suggested that cultural worldviews, self-esteem, and interpersonal relationships work together to protect individuals from death anxiety. The trauma, by disrupting this anxiety buffering system, contributes to change beliefs in victims and exposes them to a feeling of social exclusion.

The study was implemented in Lebanon, in an area characterized by high levels of poverty and a high number of the Syrian refugees. A parallel group Randomized Controlled Trial reporting on caregiver-reported child-level wellbeing. We used a combination of the Kid- and Kiddy-KINDL (parent version) for index children ages three to 12. Putative mediators of the CSI on children's psychosocial wellbeing included harsh parenting, caregiver psychological distress, caregiver wellbeing. Measurements were conducted at baseline, post-intervention and 3-months follow-up.

Thus, appropriate tools to define and measure CR as early as adolescence are essential to understand its developmental processes. To this aim, we introduce the construct of ""Cognitive Reserve Potential"" (CRP) and its corresponding index of experiential factors tailored to youth. We investigated prototypical youth exposures potentially associated with the lifelong development of CR (e.g., sport practice, musical experiences, cultural activities, and relationships with peers and family).

To evaluate if the association between parity and cognition differs between racial/ethnic groups. Participants included 778 older, postmenopausal women from the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (Latina: n&#x200a;=&#x200a;178, Non-Latino Black [NLB]: n&#x200a;=&#x200a;169, Non-Latino White [NLW]: n&#x200a;=&#x200a;431) who self-reported at least one birth. Cognitive outcomes included working memory, learning memory, and verbal fluency. Covariates included age, education, cardiovascular and other reproductive health factors, adult socioeconomic status (SES) and depressive symptoms. We fit a series of linear models to examine a) whether parity was associated with cognitive functioning, b) if this association varied by race/ethnicity through parity by race/ethnicity interactions, and c) individual parity with cognition associations stratified by race/ethnicity. In the full sample, parity was significantly negatively associated with Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) performance (b&#x200a;=&#x200a;-0.70, p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.024) but not Animal Fluency or word-list learning and memory. Tests of race/ethnicity-by-parity interactions were not statistically significant (ps&#x200a;&gt;&#x200a;0.05). However, stratified analyses by race/ethnicity showed a differential effect of parity on DSST performance, such that parity was significantly negatively associated with DSST performance (b&#x200a;=&#x200a;-1.66, p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.007) among Latinas but not in NLWs (b&#x200a;=&#x200a;-0.16, p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.74) or NLBs (b&#x200a;=&#x200a;-0.81, p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.191).

"37384265","A transdisciplinary public health model for child and adolescent mental healthcare in low- and middle-income countries.","Sheila Ramaswamy, John Vijay Sagar, Shekhar Seshadri","Despite the high burden of child and adolescent mental health problems in LMICs, attributable to poverty and childhood adversity, access to quality mental healthcare services is poor. LMICs, due to paucity of resources, also contend with shortage of trained mental health workers and paucity of standardized intervention modules and materials. In the wake of these challenges, and given that child development and mental health concerns cut across a plethora of disciplines, sectors and services, public health models need to incorporate integrated approaches to responding to the mental health and psychosocial care needs of vulnerable children. This article presents a working model for convergence, and the practice of transdisciplinary Public Health, in order to address the gaps and challenges in child and adolescent mental healthcare in LMICs.

"37368403","Associations Between Socioeconomic Status, Obesity, Cognition, and White Matter Microstructure in Children.","Zhaolong Adrian Li, Yuqi Cai, Rita L Taylor, Sarah A Eisenstein, Deanna M Barch, Scott Marek, Tamara Hershey","Lower neighborhood and household socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with negative health outcomes and altered brain structure in children. It is unclear whether such findings extend to white matter and via what mechanisms. To assess whether and how neighborhood and household SES are independently associated with children's white matter microstructure and examine whether obesity and cognitive performance (reflecting environmental cognitive and sensory stimulation) are plausible mediators. This cross-sectional study used baseline data from participants in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Data were collected at 21 US sites, and school-based recruitment was used to represent the US population. Children aged 9 to 11 years and their parents or caregivers completed assessments between October 1, 2016, and October 31, 2018. After exclusions, 8842 of 11 875 children in the ABCD study were included in the analyses. Data analysis was conducted from July 11 to December 19, 2022. Neighborhood disadvantage was derived from area deprivation indices at participants' primary residence. Household SES factors were total income and highest parental educational attainment. A restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) model was used to quantify restricted normalized directional (RND; reflecting oriented myelin organization) and restricted normalized isotropic (RNI; reflecting glial and neuronal cell bodies) diffusion in 31 major white matter tracts. The RSI measurements were scanner harmonized. Obesity was assessed through body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), age- and sex-adjusted BMI z scores, and waist circumference, and cognition was assessed through the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, pubertal development stage, intracranial volume, mean head motion, and twin or siblingship. Among 8842 children, 4543 (51.4%) were boys, and the mean (SD) age was 9.9 (0.7) years. Linear mixed-effects models revealed that greater neighborhood disadvantage was associated with lower RSI-RND in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.055; 95% CI, -0.081 to -0.028) and forceps major (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.040; 95% CI, -0.067 to -0.013). Lower parental educational attainment was associated with lower RSI-RND in the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus (eg, right hemisphere: &#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.053; 95% CI, 0.025-0.080) and bilateral corticospinal or pyramidal tract (eg, right hemisphere: &#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.042; 95% CI, 0.015-0.069). Structural equation models revealed that lower cognitive performance (eg, lower total cognition score and higher neighborhood disadvantage: &#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.012; 95% CI, -0.016 to -0.009) and greater obesity (eg, higher BMI and higher neighborhood disadvantage: &#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.004; 95% CI, -0.006 to -0.001) partially accounted for the associations between SES and RSI-RND. Lower household income was associated with higher RSI-RNI in most tracts (eg, right inferior longitudinal fasciculus: &#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.042 [95% CI, -0.073 to -0.012]; right anterior thalamic radiations: &#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.045 [95% CI, -0.075 to -0.014]), and greater neighborhood disadvantage had similar associations in primarily frontolimbic tracts (eg, right fornix: &#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.046 [95% CI, 0.019-0.074]; right anterior thalamic radiations: &#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.045 [95% CI, 0.018-0.072]). Lower parental educational attainment was associated with higher RSI-RNI in the forceps major (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.048; 95% CI, -0.077 to -0.020). Greater obesity partially accounted for these SES associations with RSI-RNI (eg, higher BMI and higher neighborhood disadvantage: &#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.015; 95% CI, 0.011-0.020). Findings were robust in sensitivity analyses and were corroborated using diffusion tensor imaging. In this cross-sectional study, both neighborhood and household contexts were associated with white matter development in children, and findings suggested that obesity and cognitive performance were possible mediators in these associations.

It is often implied but not tested that choice patterns among low-income individuals may be a factor impeding behavioral interventions aimed at improving upward economic mobility. To test this, we assessed rates of ten cognitive biases across nearly 5000 participants from 27 countries. Our analyses were primarily focused on 1458 individuals that were either low-income adults or individuals who grew up in disadvantaged households but had above-average financial well-being as adults, known as positive deviants. Using discrete and complex models, we find evidence of no differences within or between groups or countries.

Although young people appear less susceptible to severe forms of physical illness due to the coronavirus, they have not escaped unscathed from its' psychological impacts. The present study measured the content of worries in young people residing in the UK during the pandemic and how it varied with sociodemographic factors. Between May and December 2020, UK-residing participants aged 12-25 years completed an online survey that presented participants with free-text fields to describe their top three worries over the last two weeks, in addition to demographic and other information. Cross-sectional data from 2560 participants (Males&#x2009;=&#x2009;767; Female&#x2009;=&#x2009;1793) was analyzed. Irrespective of sociodemographic, a majority of the participants reported worries related to academics, followed by social relationships, own physical health, social and work routines, and physical health of others. Significantly more females reported concerns about academics, finances, physical health, social and work routines, social relationships, mental health and emotions, and physical health of others. Expectedly, more older (18-25 years) than younger (12-17 years) participants reported concerns about career-prospects and finances, while more younger than older ones were worried about academics (98.41% vs. 80.90%). With respect to financial worries, a higher percentage of BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) communities in the UK reported such worries. Ethnicity significantly predicted more worries about social relationships among White than BAME participants.

These findings highlight the need for tailored interventions depending on the major concerns for young people of different ages, sexes, ethnicities, and SES.

"37363172","The four-factor personality model and its qualitative correlates among opioid agonist therapy clients.","Ioan T Mahu, Patricia J Conrod, Sean P Barrett, A&#xef;ssata Sako, Jennifer Swansburg, Sherry H Stewart","The Four Factor Personality Vulnerability model identifies four specific personality traits (e.g., sensation seeking [SS], impulsivity [IMP], anxiety sensitivity [AS], and hopelessness [HOP]) as implicated in substance use behaviors, motives for substance use, and co-occurring psychiatric conditions. Although the relationship between these traits and polysubstance use in opioid agonist therapy (OAT) clients has been investigated quantitatively, no study has examined the qualitative expression of each trait using clients' voice. Nineteen Methadone Maintenance Therapy (MMT) clients (68.4% male, 84.2% white, mean age[SD]&#x2009;=&#x2009;42.71 [10.18]) scoring high on one of the four personality traits measured by the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale [SURPS] completed a semi-structured qualitative interview designed to explore their lived experience of their respective trait. Thematic analysis was used to derive themes, which were further quantified using content analysis. Themes emerging from interviews reflected (1) internalizing and externalizing symptoms, (2) adversity experiences, and (3) polysubstance use. Internalizing symptoms subthemes included symptoms of anxiety, fear, stress, depression, and avoidance coping. Externalizing subthemes included anger, disinhibited cognitions, and anti-social and risk-taking behaviors. Adverse experiences subthemes included poor health, poverty, homelessness, unemployment, trauma, and conflict. Finally, polysubstance use subthemes include substance types, methods of use, and motives. Differences emerged between personality profiles in the relative endorsement of various subthemes, including those pertaining to polysubstance use, that were largely as theoretically expected. Personality is associated with unique cognitive, affective, and behavioral lived experiences, suggesting that personality may be a novel intervention target in adjunctive psychosocial treatment for those undergoing OAT.",2023,1,1,"Frontiers in psychiatry","10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1129274","PMC10289030","Front Psychiatry","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.15585/MMWR.MM7006A4; 10.1002/14651858.CD002207.pub4; 10.3389/fnins.2020.00569; 10.2105/AJPH.2019.305412; 10.1016/S0376-8716(97)00117-8; 10.1097/HRP.0000000000000052; 10.1186/S12954-020-00396-X; 10.1093/epirev/mxaa005; 10.1016/j.drugpo.2017.05.044; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2005.08.010; 10.1016/j.jsat.2013.07.001; 10.1503/cmaj.170958; 10.1097/ADM.0000000000000166; 10.1097/ADM.0000000000000193; 10.1007/s40429-016-0127-6; 10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00770; 10.1037//0893-164x.14.3.231; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2019.106056; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.109133; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2009.07.001; 10.1111/eip.12114; 10.7202/1069458ar; 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; 10.1111/J.1365-2648.2007.04569.X; 10.1080/14659891.2019.1704083; 10.1177/0844562120924516; 10.1186/S13722-021-00213-1; 10.1037/0893-706164X.14.3.243; 10.1177/1073191118820135; 10.1016/S0092-6566(03)00067-9; 10.1159/000328510; 10.1097/00006842-199603000-00003; 10.1097/01.PSY.0000164012.88829.41; 10.1016/J.JPAIN.2013.08.005; 10.1155/2017/9724371; 10.1017/S0954579422001262; 10.2147/PRBM.S44762; 10.1016/S0006-3223(02)01475-0; 10.1016/J.JANXDIS.2016.04.011; 10.3109/00952990.2010.535581; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2016.08.020; 10.1007/s11135-017-0574-8; 10.1037/1040-3590.19.2.176; 10.1016/S0027-9684(15)30175-9; 10.1001/JAMA.2016.9795; 10.4103/0976-3147.91934","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Life Sciences Centre, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada."

This study aimed to assess changes in body composition, fitness, and cognitive abilities in children from low-income households after a summer physical activity program and explored whether time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was related to these changes. Participant's (<i>N</i> = 77) body composition, aerobic fitness (i.e., PACER), and cognitive function (i.e., modified flanker task) were measured during week 1 and week 3. MVPA was collected via hip accelerometer worn during program hours. Paired t-tests and regression analyses were conducted to determine changes between week 1 and 3, whether participation was related to changes in fitness, adiposity, and cognitive function. T-tests revealed significant changes in PACER score (10.71 &#xb1; 7.72 to 13.301 &#xb1; 10.68; <i>p&#xa0;</i>&lt; 0.001) and incongruent accuracy on the flanker task (65.94% &#xb1; 23.83 to 69.00% &#xb1; 21.89; <i>p&#xa0;</i>&lt; 0.006), however no significant change in BMI-for-age percentile or body fat percentage was detected. Additionally, regression analyses revealed no significant relationship between change in MVPA or attendance, and changes in PACER, flanker task performance, BMI, or body fat percentage.

"37342774","Can prosocial values improve brain health?","Agustin Ibanez, Diana Matallana, Bruce Miller","Prosocial values play a critical role in promoting care and concern for the well-being of others and prioritizing the common good of society. Evidence from population-based reports, cognitive neuroscience, and clinical studies suggests that these values depend on social cognition processes, such as empathy, deontological moral cognition, moral emotions, and social cooperation. Additionally, indirect evidence suggests that various forms of prosocial behaviors are associated with positive health outcomes at the behavioral, cardiovascular, immune, stress-related, and inflammatory pathways. However, it is unclear whether prosociality can positively influence brain health outcomes. In this perspective, we propose that prosocial values are not only influenced by brain conditions but could also potentially play a role in protecting brain health. We review studies from various fields that support this claim, including recent reports of prosociality-based interventions impacting brain health. We then explore potential multilevel mechanisms, based on the reduction of allostatic overload at behavioral, cardiovascular, immune, stress-related, and inflammatory levels. Finally, we propose potential prosociality-based interventions for improving brain health in at-risk populations, such as psychiatric and neurological patients, and individuals exposed to poverty or violence.

This study used data from specialized homeless programs from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Homeless Operations Management System to explore prevalence and correlates of chronic homelessness among veterans with GD in this program and to describe initial descriptive epidemiology. Chi-square tests, analyses of variance, and logistic regressions were conducted to examine differences in sociodemographic, military, clinical, and behavioral characteristics between veterans with versus without chronic homelessness. Of 6053 veterans with GD, 1733 (28.6%) had chronic homelessness. Veterans with versus without chronic homelessness were more likely to be older, male, unemployed, and of low educational attainment and report having spent fewer years in the military. Chronic homelessness was associated with elevated odds of mental health and medical diagnoses, traumatic experiences, incarceration, and suicidal thoughts. Veterans with versus without chronic homelessness more frequently reported needing substance use, medical and psychiatric treatments but expressed low interest in participation in psychiatric treatment. Veterans with GD and chronic homelessness have more clinical and behavioral concerns and needs for treatment, but participate in treatment at lower rates.

The present study addressed the following aims in a clinical sample: whether SEs predict general versus substance-specific SUD in adolescence and adulthood after controlling for conduct disorder symptoms (CDsymp); whether SEs predict SUDs across drug classes; whether SEs predict change in SUD from adolescence to adulthood; and whether there are racial/ethnic differences in associations. Longitudinal analyses were conducted using data from a sample of 744 clinical probands recruited from residential and outpatient SUD treatment facilities in CO during adolescence (M<sub>age</sub> = 16.26) and re-assessed twice in adulthood (M<sub>ages</sub> = 22.56 and 28.96), approximately seven and twelve years after first assessment. SEs and CDsymp were assessed in adolescence. SUD severity was assessed at adolescence and twice during adulthood. SEs assessed in adolescence robustly predicted general SUD for legal and illegal substances in adolescence and adulthood, whereas CDsymp predicted SUD primarily in adolescence. Higher positive and negative SEs in adolescence were associated with greater SUD severity after controlling for CDsymp, with similar magnitudes. Results indicated cross-substance effects of SEs on SUD. We found no evidence for racial/ethnic differences in associations.

With a simulation study, we compared various approaches for incorporating the survey weights and design into weighting and matching-based causal inference methods. When the models were correctly specified, most approaches performed well. However, when a variable was treated as an unmeasured confounder and the survey weights were constructed to depend on this variable, only the matching methods that used the survey weights in causal estimation and as a covariate in matching continued to perform well. If unmeasured confounders are potentially associated with the survey sample design, we recommend that investigators include the survey weights as a covariate in matching, in addition to incorporating them in causal effect estimation.

SES correlates with psychological and environmental conditions that could contribute to the disproportionate burden of chronic stress. Chronic stress can induce changes in global DNA methylation and gene expression, which increases risk of chronic pain. We aimed to explore the association of epigenetic aging and SES in middle-to-older age individuals with varying degrees of knee pain. Participants completed self-reported pain, a blood draw, and answered demographic questions pertaining to SES. We used an epigenetic clock previously associated with knee pain (DNAmGrimAge) and the subsequent difference of predicted epigenetic age (DNAmGrimAge-Diff). Overall, the mean DNAmGrimAge was 60.3 (&#xb1;7.6), and the average DNAmGrimAge-diff was 2.4 years (&#xb1;5.6 years). Those experiencing high-impact pain earned less income and had lower education levels compared to both low-impact and no pain groups. Differences in DNAmGrimAge-diff across pain groups were found, whereby individuals with high-impact pain had accelerated epigenetic aging (&#x223c;5 years) compared to low-impact pain and no pain control groups (both &#x223c;1 year). Our main finding was that epigenetic aging mediated the associations of income and education with pain impact, as such the relationship between SES and pain outcomes may occur through potential interactions with the epigenome reflective of accelerated cellular aging. PERSPECTIVE: Socioeconomic status (SES) has previously been implicated in the pain experience. The present manuscript aims to present a potential social-biological link between SES and pain via accelerated epigenetic aging.",2023,6,12,"The journal of pain","10.1016/j.jpain.2023.06.002","PMC10713866","J Pain","eng",NA,NA,"R01 AG076082; R37 AG033906; R01 AG059809; R01 AG067757; UL1 TR003096","10.1159/000503289; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08111.x; 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001033; 10.1097/nor.0000000000000620; 10.1016/s0140-6736(18)30488-4; 10.1073/pnas.2012350117; 10.1177/17448069221118004; 10.1177/1744806919871819; 10.15585/mmwr.mm6736a2; 10.1534/genetics.114.173492; 10.1186/s13587-015-0017-x; 10.1038/s41598-017-16391-5; 10.3389/fncir.2018.00014; 10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00163; 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000762; 10.1016/j.pain.2007.05.005; 10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115; 10.1038/s41586-021-04190-y; 10.18689/ijons-1000106; 10.1097/01.brs.0000131435.56714.15; 10.1097/00007632-200006010-00011; 10.18632/aging.101414; 10.18632/aging.101684; 10.1016/j.bja.2019.03.023; 10.1080/09638280802309327; 10.1177/1744806920966902; 10.1093/jpepsy/jsab113; 10.1093/pm/pny119; 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000964; 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001433; 10.2147/jpr.S386565; 10.2105/ajph.2019.304964; 10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102529; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.04.010; 10.1186/1471-2458-10-475; 10.1016/j.exger.2022.111861; 10.1080/15592294.2022.2111752; 10.1016/j.jpain.2004.05.005; 10.1016/j.expneurol.2014.09.001; 10.18632/aging.101168; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2015.06.018; 10.1007/s10865-021-00234-w; 10.1016/j.joep.2009.10.008; 10.1016/j.jpain.2012.04.003; 10.1016/j.cophys.2018.05.006; 10.1007/s12603-022-1758-z; 10.1007/s40122-022-00359-z; 10.1016/j.jacc.2019.04.042; 10.1002/ejp.1409; 10.1016/j.jpain.2008.05.005; 10.1016/0304-3959(92)90154-4; 10.1289/ehp.114-a160; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.12.007","Conflicts of Interest.

Recent work suggests that the gut microbiome of symptomatic patients with AD has an altered taxonomic composition compared with that of healthy, cognitively normal control individuals. However, knowledge about changes in the gut microbiome before the onset of symptomatic AD is limited. In this cross-sectional study that accounted for clinical covariates and dietary intake, we compared the taxonomic composition and gut microbial function in a cohort of 164 cognitively normal individuals, 49 of whom showed biomarker evidence of early preclinical AD. Gut microbial taxonomic profiles of individuals with preclinical AD were distinct from those of individuals without evidence of preclinical AD. The change in gut microbiome composition correlated with &#x3b2;-amyloid (A&#x3b2;) and tau pathological biomarkers but not with biomarkers of neurodegeneration, suggesting that the gut microbiome may change early in the disease process. We identified specific gut bacterial taxa associated with preclinical AD. Inclusion of these microbiome features improved the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of machine learning classifiers for predicting preclinical AD status when tested on a subset of the cohort (65 of the 164 participants). Gut microbiome correlates of preclinical AD neuropathology may improve our understanding of AD etiology and may help to identify gut-derived markers of AD risk.",2023,6,14,"Science translational medicine","10.1126/scitranslmed.abo2984","PMC10680783","Sci Transl Med","eng","D006801; D000069196; D000544; D003430; D064307; D016229","Humans; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Alzheimer Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Microbiota; Amyloid beta-Peptides","P01 AG003991; P01 AG026276; P30 DK052574; R01 AG057680","NA","G.D. is a co-founder, holder of equity in, a consultant to, and a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of Viosera Therapeutics, which is developing combination antimicrobial therapy against bacterial pathogens.

"37314797","Acceptability, Tolerability, and Estimates of Putative Treatment Effects of Probiotics as Adjunctive Treatment in Patients With Depression: A Randomized Clinical Trial.","Viktoriya L Nikolova, Anthony J Cleare, Allan H Young, James M Stone","The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a promising target for novel treatments for mood disorders, such as probiotics. However, few clinical trials have been conducted, and further safety and efficacy data are needed to support this treatment approach. To provide acceptability and tolerability data and estimates of intervention effect size for probiotics as adjunctive treatment for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). In this single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot randomized clinical trial, adults aged 18 to 55 years with MDD taking antidepressant medication but having an incomplete response were studied. A random sample was recruited from primary and secondary care services and general advertising in London, United Kingdom. Data were collected between September 2019 and May 2022 and analyzed between July and September 2022. Multistrain probiotic (8 billion colony-forming units per day) or placebo daily for 8 weeks added to ongoing antidepressant medication. The pilot outcomes of the trial were retention, acceptability, tolerability, and estimates of putative treatment effect on clinical symptoms (depression: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAMD-17] and Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology [IDS] scores; anxiety: Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [HAMA] and General Anxiety Disorder [GAD-7] scores) to be used as indicators for a definitive trial. Of 50 included participants, 49 received the intervention and were included in intent-to-treat analyses; of these, 39 (80%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 31.7 (9.8) years. A total of 24 were randomized to probiotic and 25 to placebo. Attrition was 8% (1 in the probiotic group and 3 in the placebo group), adherence was 97.2%, and there were no serious adverse reactions. For the probiotic group, mean (SD) HAMD-17 scores at weeks 4 and 8 were 11.00 (5.13) and 8.83 (4.28), respectively; IDS, 30.17 (11.98) and 25.04 (11.68); HAMA, 11.71 (5.86) and 8.17 (4.68); and GAD-7, 7.78 (4.12) and 7.63 (4.77). For the placebo group, mean (SD) HAMD-17 scores at weeks 4 and 8 were 14.04 (3.70) and 11.09 (3.22), respectively; IDS, 33.82 (9.26) and 29.64 (9.31); HAMA, 14.70 (5.47) and 10.95 (4.48); and GAD-7, 10.91 (5.32) and 9.48 (5.18). Standardized effect sizes (SES) from linear mixed models demonstrated that the probiotic group attained greater improvements in depressive symptoms according to HAMD-17 scores (week 4: SES, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.01-0.98) and IDS Self Report scores (week 8: SES, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.03-0.87) as well as greater improvements in anxiety symptoms according to HAMA scores (week 4: SES, 0.67; 95% CI, 0-0.95; week 8: SES, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.06-1.05), but not GAD-7 scores (week 4: SES, 0.57; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.82; week 8: SES, 0.32; 95% CI, -0.19 to 0.65), compared with the placebo group. The acceptability, tolerability, and estimated effect sizes on key clinical outcomes are promising and encourage further investigation of probiotics as add-on treatment for people with MDD in a definitive efficacy trial.

Currently, diagnosis and management of early AD are largely guided by clinical symptoms. FDA-approved neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers can aid detection and diagnosis, but the clinical implementation of these testing modalities is limited because of availability, cost, and perceived invasiveness. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs) may enable earlier and faster diagnoses as well as aid in risk assessment, early detection, prognosis, and management.

"37294204","Regional Cortical Thickness Correlates of Intellectual Abilities Differ in Children With Traumatic Brain Injury Versus Those With Orthopedic Injury in the Chronic Post-Injury Phase.","Tricia L Merkley, Colt Halter, Benjamin Graul, Shawn D Gale, Chase Junge, Madeleine Reading, Sierra Jarvis, Kaitlyn Greer, Chad Squires,  ..., Derin Cobia","A decline in intellectual functioning (intelligence quotient [IQ]) is often observed following more severe forms of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is a useful index for long-term outcome. Identifying brain correlates of IQ can serve to inform developmental trajectories of behavior in this population. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we examined the relationship between intellectual abilities and patterns of cortical thickness in children with a history of TBI or with orthopedic injury (OI) in the chronic phase of injury recovery. Participants were 47 children with OI and 58 children with TBI, with TBI severity ranging from complicated-mild to severe. Ages ranged from 8 to 14 years old, with an average age of 10.47 years, and an injury-to-test range of &#x223c;1-5 years. The groups did not differ in age or sex. The intellectual ability estimate (full-scale [FS]IQ-2) was derived from a two-form (Vocabulary and Matrix Reasoning subtests) Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). MRI data were processed using the FreeSurfer toolkit and harmonized across data collection sites using neuroComBat procedures, while holding demographic features (i.e., sex, socioeconomic status [SES]), TBI status, and FSIQ-2 constant. Separate general linear models per group (TBI and OI) and a single interaction model with all participants were conducted with all significant results withstanding correction for multiple comparisons via permutation testing. Intellectual ability was higher (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) in the OI group (FSIQ-2&#x2009;=&#x2009;110.81) than in the TBI group (FSIQ-2&#x2009;=&#x2009;99.81). In children with OI, bi-hemispheric regions, including the right pre-central gyrus and precuneus and bilateral inferior temporal and left occipital areas were related to IQ, such that higher IQ was associated with thicker cortex in these regions. In contrast, only cortical thickness in the right pre-central gyrus and bilateral cuneus positively related to IQ in children with TBI. Significant interaction effects were found in the bilateral temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes and left frontal regions, indicating that the relationship between IQ and cortical thickness differed between groups in these regions. Changes in cortical associations with IQ after TBI may reflect direct injury effects and/or adaptation in cortical structure and intellectual functioning, particularly in the bilateral posterior parietal and inferior temporal regions. This suggests that the substrates of intellectual ability are particularly susceptible to acquired injury in the integrative association cortex. Longitudinal work is needed to account for normal developmental changes and to investigate how cortical thickness and intellectual functioning and their association change over time following TBI. Improved understanding of how TBI-related cortical thickness alterations relate to cognitive outcome could lead to improved predictions of outcome following brain injury.",2023,10,1,"Journal of neurotrauma","10.1089/neu.2022.0524","PMC10623066","J Neurotrauma","eng","D006801; D002648; D007223; D002675; D000293; D000070642; D001921; D003071; D001930; D008279","Humans; Child; Infant; Child, Preschool; Adolescent; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Brain; Cognition; Brain Injuries; Magnetic Resonance Imaging","R01 HD048946","10.1177/0883073821996095; 10.1089/neu.2019.6918; 10.33588/rn.7007.2019393; 10.1542/peds.2011-0438; 10.3109/02699052.2013.862739; 10.1111/ene.12719; 10.1017/S1355617721001296; 10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2011.09.008; 10.1016/j.intell.2013.07.010; 10.1038/nature04513; 10.1073/pnas.0402680101; 10.1089/neu.2008.0615; 10.1097/HTR.0000000000000040; 10.1037/0894-4105.21.5.515; 10.1037/a0032837; 10.1017/S1355617712000756; 10.1017/S1355617712001531; 10.1177/147323000803600102; 10.1089/neu.2014.3555; 10.1037/0033-2909.133.3.535; 10.1016/s0140-6736(74)91639-0; 10.1080/01688639708403763; 10.3109/02699052.2011.624568; 10.1001/archneurol.2010.149; 10.3109/02699052.2015.1011234; 10.1006/nimg.1998.0395; 10.1006/nimg.1998.0396; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.01.021; 10.1109/TMI.2006.887364; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.02.051; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116450; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.11.024; 10.1093/biostatistics/kxj037; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.05.068; 10.1097/MOP.0b013e3283395f13; 10.1097/00001199-200505000-00006; 10.1136/ip.2009.022483; 10.1136/adc.2005.072405; 10.1136/jnnp.2005.081901; 10.1017/S1355617709090481; 10.1093/jpepsy/jss070; 10.1016/j.rehab.2020.01.008; 10.1542/peds.2009-0365; 10.1089/neu.2012.2403; 10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2012.01.003; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.09.010; 10.1177/0883073816654143; 10.1016/j.intell.2008.09.006; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.01.016; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.09.038; 10.1146/annurev.neuro.28.061604.135655; 10.1016/B978-0-444-63521-1.00041-8; 10.1007/s11065-014-9261-x; 10.1196/annals.1425.006","Keith Owen Yeates is supported by the Ronald and Irene Ward Chair in Pediatric Brain Injury from the Alberta Children's Hospital Foundation.

"37272829","Lathyrism in Spain: Lessons from 68 publications following the 1936-39 Civil War.","Santiago Gim&#xe9;nez-Rold&#xe1;n, Valerie S Palmer, Peter S Spencer","After the end of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), an estimated 1,000 patients presented with lathyrism due to their excessive and prolonged consumption of grasspea (<i>Lathyrus sativus</i> L.) against the backdrop of poverty, drought, and famine. Based on 68 scientific communications between 1941 and 1962 by qualified medical professionals, the disease emerged in different geographical locations involving selective populations: (1) farmers from extensive areas of central Spain, traditionally producers and consumers of grasspea; (2) immigrants in the industrial belt of Catalonia and in the Basque Country, areas with little or no production of grasspea, which was imported from producing areas; (3) workers in Galicia, an area where the legume is neither produced nor consumed, who were seasonally displaced to high-production areas of grasspea in Castille; and (4) inmates of overcrowded postwar Spanish prisons. Original reports included failed attempts by Carlos Jim&#xe9;nez D&#xed;az (1898-1967) to induce experimental lathyrism, the neuropathology of lathyrism in early stages of the disease in two patients, as reported by Carlos Oliveras de la Riva (1914-2007), and the special susceptibility of children to develop a severe form of lathyrism after relatively brief periods of consumption of the neurotoxic seed of <i>L. sativus</i>. In the Spanish Basque Country, <i>L. cicera</i> L. (<i>aizkol</i>) was cultivated exclusively as animal fodder. Patients who were forced to feed on this plant developed unusual manifestations of lathyrism, such as axial myoclonus and severe neuropsychiatric disorders, unknown in other regions of the country and previously unreported. The postwar epidemic of lathyrism in Spain represents the most extensively studied outbreak of this self-limiting but crippling upper motor neuron disease.",2023,1,1,"Journal of the history of the neurosciences","10.1080/0964704X.2023.2195442",NA,"J Hist Neurosci","eng","D002648; D000818; D006801; D007842; D013030; D027807; D009422; D000069338","Child; Animals; Humans; Lathyrism; Spain; Lathyrus; Nervous System Diseases; Neuropathology",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, Oregon Health &amp; Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA."
"37270494","Digital health technologies for peripartum depression management among low-socioeconomic populations: perspectives from patients, providers, and social media channels.","Alexandra Zingg, Tavleen Singh, Amy Franklin, Angela Ross, Sudhakar Selvaraj, Jerrie Refuerzo, Sahiti Myneni","Peripartum Depression (PPD) affects approximately 10-15% of perinatal women in the U.S., with those of low socioeconomic status (low-SES) more likely to develop symptoms. Multilevel treatment barriers including social stigma and not having appropriate access to mental health resources have played a major role in PPD-related disparities. Emerging advances in digital technologies and analytics provide opportunities to identify and address access barriers, knowledge gaps, and engagement issues. However, most market solutions for PPD prevention and management are produced generically without considering the specialized needs of low-SES populations. In this study, we examine and portray the information and technology needs of low-SES women by considering their unique perspectives and providers' current experiences. We supplement our understanding of women's needs by harvesting online social discourse in PPD-related forums, which we identify as valuable information resources among these populations. We conducted (a) 2 focus groups (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;9), (b) semi-structured interviews with care providers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;9) and low SES women (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;10), and (c) secondary analysis of online messages (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1,424). Qualitative data were inductively analyzed using a grounded theory approach. A total of 134 open concepts resulted from patient interviews, 185 from provider interviews, and 106 from focus groups. These revealed six core themes for PPD management, including ""Use of Technology/Features"", ""Access to Care"", and ""Pregnancy Education"". Our social media analysis revealed six PPD topics of importance in online messages, including ""Physical and Mental Health"" (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;725 messages), and ""Social Support"" (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;674). Our data triangulation allowed us to analyze PPD information and technology needs at different levels of granularity. Differences between patients and providers included a focus from providers on needing better support from administrative staff, as well as better PPD clinical decision support.

"37258714","Early life stress in male mice blunts responsiveness in a translationally-relevant reward task.","Erin E Hisey, Emma L Fritsch, Emily L Newman, Kerry J Ressler, Brian D Kangas, William A Carlezon","Early-life stress (ELS) leaves signatures upon the brain that persist throughout the lifespan and increase the risk of psychiatric illnesses including mood and anxiety disorders. In humans, myriad forms of ELS-including childhood abuse, bullying, poverty, and trauma-are increasingly prevalent. Understanding the signs of ELS, including those associated with psychiatric illness, will enable improved treatment and prevention. Here, we developed a novel procedure to model human ELS in mice and identify translationally-relevant biomarkers of mood and anxiety disorders. We exposed male mice (C57BL/6&#x2009;J) to an early-life (juvenile) chronic social defeat stress (jCSDS) and examined social interaction and responsivity to reward during adulthood. As expected, jCSDS-exposed mice showed a socially avoidant phenotype in open-field social interaction tests. However, sucrose preference tests failed to demonstrate ELS-induced reductions in choice for the sweetened solution, suggesting no effect on reward function. To explore whether other tasks might be more sensitive to changes in motivation, we tested the mice in the Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT), a procedure often used in humans to study reward learning deficits associated with depressive illness. In a touchscreen PRT variant that was reverse-translated to maximize alignment with the version used in human subjects, mice exposed to jCSDS displayed significant reductions in the tendency to develop response biases for the more richly-rewarded stimulus, a hallmark sign of anhedonia when observed in humans. Our findings suggest that translationally-relevant procedures that utilize the same endpoints across species may enable the development of improved model systems that more accurately predict outcomes in humans.",2023,11,1,"Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","10.1038/s41386-023-01610-7","PMC10579416","Neuropsychopharmacology","eng","D006801; D051379; D008297; D002648; D000818; D000328; D000076783; D013315; D008810; D001921; D012201","Humans; Mice; Male; Child; Animals; Adult; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Stress, Psychological; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Brain; Reward","F32 MH125634; P50 MH115874; R01 MH063266; T32 MH125786","10.1503/jpn.180053; 10.1037/bul0000270; 10.1146/annurev-devpsych-121318-084950; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.10.012; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.20081192; 10.3389/fnsys.2022.860847; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.06.021; 10.3389/fnbeh.2019.00167; 10.3389/fnbeh.2022.882464; 10.1093/ijnp/pyy038; 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.01.016; 10.3389/fnbeh.2011.00072; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2020.12.030; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0885-17.2017; 10.1097/FBP.0000000000000155; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.12.014; 10.1038/nprot.2007.441; 10.1016/j.cell.2007.09.018; 10.1038/nprot.2011.361; 10.1901/jeab.2008.90-103; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.09091379; 10.1016/0091-3057(91)90284-9; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2004.11.026; 10.1007/s40614-021-00288-w; 10.1038/s41398-020-00969-1; 10.1007/s40473-015-0044-3; 10.1038/s41386-021-01250-9; 10.1038/npp.2016.215; 10.1097/HRP.0000000000000230; 10.1038/s41398-022-02159-7; 10.1038/s41380-019-0628-5; 10.1038/nature11713; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.12.009; 10.1038/nn.3591; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1731-10.2010; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1787-13.2014","WAC and KJR are members of the NPP editorial board.

"37223988","Dynamics of pulsatile activities of arcuate kisspeptin neurons in aging female mice.","Teppei Goto, Mitsue Hagihara, Kazunari Miyamichi","Reproductive senescence is broadly observed across mammalian females, including humans, eventually leading to a loss of fertility. The pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is essential for gonad function, is primarily controlled by kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC<sup>kiss</sup>), the pulse generator of GnRH. The pulsatility of GnRH release, as assessed by the amount of circulating gonadotropin, is markedly reduced in aged animals, suggesting that the malfunctions of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> may be responsible for reproductive aging and menopause-related disorders. However, the activity dynamics of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> during the natural transition to reproductive senescence remain unclear. Herein, we introduce chronic in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> in female mice by fiber photometry to monitor the synchronous episodes of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> (SEs<sup>kiss</sup>), a known hallmark of GnRH pulse generator activity, from the fully reproductive to acyclic phase over 1 year. During the reproductive phase, we find that not only the frequency, but also the intensities and waveforms of individual SEs<sup>kiss</sup>, vary depending on the stage of the estrus cycle. During the transition to reproductive senescence, the integrity of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> patterns, including the frequency and waveforms, remains mostly unchanged, whereas the intensities tend to decline. These data illuminate the temporal dynamics of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> activities in aging female mice. More generally, our findings demonstrate the utility of fiber-photometry-based chronic imaging of neuroendocrine regulators in the brain to characterize aging-associated malfunction.",2023,5,24,"eLife","10.7554/eLife.82533","PMC10208635","Elife","eng","D000818; D005260; D051379; D000375; D007987; D059648; D009474; D012098","Animals; Female; Mice; Aging; Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone; Kisspeptins; Neurons; Reproduction",NA,"10.1126/science.100883; 10.1371/journal.pone.0035538; 10.1002/0471142301.nsa04is48; 10.1126/science.462193; 10.1038/nature12354; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1775-08.2008; 10.1073/pnas.1713897114; 10.1210/en.2016-1351; 10.1073/pnas.0704114104; 10.1095/biolreprod28.3.598; 10.1210/en.2011-1521; 10.1016/S0140-6736(98)05352-5; 10.1210/jcem.85.5.6612; 10.1210/en.2018-01047; 10.1210/en.2018-00653; 10.1016/j.neuron.2017.05.038; 10.1159/000335994; 10.1098/rspb.1962.0066; 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2016.10.018; 10.1210/en.2007-0078; 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2009.06.015; 10.1095/biolreprod38.4.780; 10.1006/meth.2001.1262; 10.1126/science.abq4515; 10.1111/jog.14124; 10.1095/biolreprod59.6.1477; 10.1210/edrv.21.2.0394; 10.1210/en.2019-00193; 10.1038/s41467-022-35243-z; 10.1210/en.2015-1740; 10.1210/endo-116-2-813; 10.1073/pnas.2117767119; 10.1073/pnas.2009156118; 10.1210/en.2008-1667; 10.1095/biolreprod24.4.784; 10.1095/biolreprod27.2.327; 10.1210/en.2014-1890; 10.1016/j.celrep.2018.06.037; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0658-18.2018; 10.1016/j.yfrne.2013.07.003; 10.1095/biolreprod51.6.1264; 10.1210/endo-126-2-884; 10.1126/science.abf4588; 10.1210/en.2013-1502; 10.1111/jne.12257; 10.1095/biolreprod39.5.1060","TG, MH, KM No competing interests declared","Laboratory for Comparative Connectomics, RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research, Kobe, Japan."
"37208001","The association between population drinking and ischemic heart disease mortality in educational groups.","Thor Norstr&#xf6;m, Jonas Landberg","A large number of observational studies have found a J-shaped relationship between alcohol intake and ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk. However, some studies suggest that the alleged cardio-protective effect may be an artifact in the way that the elevated risk for abstainers is due to self-selection on risk factors for IHD. The aim of this paper is to estimate the association between alcohol and IHD-mortality on the basis of aggregate time-series data, where the problem with selection effects is not present. In addition, we will analyze SES-specific mortality to investigate whether there is any socio-economic gradient in the relationship at issue. SES was measured by educational level. We used IHD-mortality in three educational groups as outcome. Per capita alcohol consumption was proxied by Systembolaget's alcohol sales (litres of alcohol 100% per capita 15+). Swedish quarterly data on mortality and alcohol consumption spanned the period 1991Q1-2020Q4. We applied SARIMA time-series analysis. Survey data were used to construct an indicator of heavy SES-specific episodic drinking. The estimated association between per capita consumption and IHD-mortality was positive and statistically significant in the two groups with primary and secondary education, but not in the group with postsecondary education. The association was significantly stronger the lower the educational group. Although the associations were generally stronger for males than for females, these differences were not statistically significant (P&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Our findings suggest that the detrimental impact of per capita consumption on IHD-mortality was stronger the lower the educational group.",2023,7,10,"Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire)","10.1093/alcalc/agad033","PMC10331932","Alcohol Alcohol","eng","D008297; D005260; D006801; D000428; D017202; D012307; D000431; D013548","Male; Female; Humans; Alcohol Drinking; Myocardial Ischemia; Risk Factors; Ethanol; Sweden","2017-01769; FO2017-0084","10.1093/alcalc/37.5.409; 10.1007/s10654-009-9383-2; 10.1111/j.1530-0277.1998.tb04391.x; 10.1093/aje/kwt224; 10.1111/add.15567; 10.1046/j.1360-0443.2000.951015056.x; 10.1111/add.14703; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002476; 10.1111/add.12104; 10.1024/suc.2003.49.2.95; 10.1080/09652140020021206; 10.1007/s11883-022-00992-1; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03195.x; 10.1159/000504437; 10.1111/dar.13232; 10.1093/biomet/65.2.297; 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309115; 10.2188/jea.JE20150010; 10.1111/dar.13114; 10.1080/09595230500293845; 10.1016/S0899-3289(99)00013-9; 10.1080/09652140020021143; 10.1111/dar.13304; 10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30052-9; 10.1080/09595230600741057; 10.1111/j.1465-3362.2009.00059.x; 10.1111/add.13757; 10.1093/aje/kwp451; 10.1186/s12916-014-0182-6; 10.1136/bmj.d671; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1990.tb03710.x; 10.1136/heart.83.4.394; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1985.tb05294.x; 10.15288/jsad.2017.78.375",NA,"Department of Public Health Sciences, Stockholm University, Stockholm 106 91, Sweden."

To examine whether there were differences in overall and telehealth addiction treatment utilization after telehealth policy changes during the COVID-19 pandemic by age, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This cohort study examined electronic health record and claims data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California for adults (age &#x2265;18 years) with drug use problems before the COVID-19 pandemic (from March 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019) and during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020; hereafter referred to as COVID-19 onset). Analyses were conducted between March 2021 and March 2023. The expansion of telehealth services during COVID-19 onset. Generalized estimating equation models were fit to compare addiction treatment utilization during COVID-19 onset with that before the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilization measures included the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set of treatment initiation and engagement (including inpatient, outpatient, and telehealth encounters or receipt of medication for opioid use disorder [OUD]), 12-week retention (days in treatment), and OUD pharmacotherapy retention. Telehealth treatment initiation and engagement were also examined. Differences in changes in utilization by age group, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES) were examined. Among the 19&#x202f;648 participants in the pre-COVID-19 cohort (58.5% male; mean [SD] age, 41.0 [17.5] years), 1.6% were American Indian or Alaska Native; 7.5%, Asian or Pacific Islander; 14.3%, Black; 20.8%, Latino or Hispanic; 53.4%, White; and 2.5%, unknown race. Among the 16&#x202f;959 participants in the COVID-19 onset cohort (56.5% male; mean [SD] age, 38.9 [16.3] years), 1.6% were American Indian or Alaska Native; 7.4%, Asian or Pacific Islander; 14.6%, Black; 22.2%, Latino or Hispanic; 51.0%, White; and 3.2%, unknown race. Odds of overall treatment initiation increased from before the COVID-19 pandemic to COVID-19 onset for all age, race, ethnicity, and SES subgroups except for patients aged 50 years or older; patients aged 18 to 34 years had the greatest increases (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.22-1.40). Odds of telehealth treatment initiation increased for all patient subgroups without variation by race, ethnicity, or SES, although increases were greater for patients aged 18 to 34 years (aOR, 7.17; 95% CI, 6.24-8.24). Odds of overall treatment engagement increased (aOR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.24) without variation by patient subgroups. Retention increased by 1.4 days (95% CI, 0.6-2.2 days), and OUD pharmacotherapy retention did not change (adjusted mean difference, -5.2 days; 95% CI, -12.7 to 2.4 days).

"37200341","Formal help for persons with multiple sclerosis-Background factors associated with usage of personal assistance and home help in Sweden.","Daniel St&#xe5;hl, Emilie Friberg","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease that may cause several different symptoms, some which may entail the need for help in daily life. The aim of this study was to explore the association between sociodemographic background factors and the use of personal assistance and home help services (home help) among persons with MS in Sweden. The study was based on cross-sectional survey data merged with register data and included 3,863 persons with MS aged 20-51. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with the use of personal assistance and home help. The central finding of this study was that grade of impairment, as determined by the Expanded Disability Status Scale for Multiple Sclerosis (EDSS), was the most important variable associated with the use of both personal assistance (p &lt; 0.001, OR 18.83) and home help (p &lt; 0.001, OR 6.83). Living alone and receiving sickness benefit were also both associated with the use of personal assistance (p &lt; 0.001, OR 3.32; p 0.001, OR 3.32) and home help (p 0.004, OR 2.56; p 0.011, OR 2.56). Stating a visible symptom of MS as being the most limiting factor of the disease (p 0.001, OR 2.73) and having a disposable income below the limit for poverty risk (p 0.02, OR 2.16) was associated with the use of personal assistance. Receiving informal, meaning unpaid, help (p 0.049, OR 1.89) was associated with the use of home help. Several background factors were controlled for but were not related to differences in the usage of formal help. The results indicated no significant differences in demographic characteristics that could be linked to unequal distribution. However, differences were found between those using personal assistance and home help. The latter were mainly affected by invisible symptoms, suggesting a plausible influencing factor in the chances of obtaining more comprehensive help in the form of personal assistance.

Several theories propose that early experiences of adversity or low SES can alter the pace of neurodevelopment during childhood and adolescence. These theories make contrasting predictions about whether adverse experiences and low SES are associated with accelerated or delayed neurodevelopment. We contextualize these predictions within the context of normative development of cortical and subcortical structure and review existing evidence on SES and structural brain development to adjudicate between competing hypotheses. Although none of these theories are fully consistent with observed SES-related differences in brain development, existing evidence suggests that low SES is associated with brain structure trajectories more consistent with a delayed or simply different developmental pattern than an acceleration in neurodevelopment.",2023,9,1,"Trends in cognitive sciences","10.1016/j.tics.2023.03.011","PMC10524122","Trends Cogn Sci","eng","D002648; D000293; D006801; D012923; D001921","Child; Adolescent; Humans; Social Class; Brain","R01 MH106482; R37 MH119194","10.1177/0963721412453588; 10.1177/0963721419837670; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.20081192; 10.1176/APPI.AJP.2021.20081192; 10.1037/met0000407; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2023.119885; 10.1007/978-l-4615-4831-7_25; 10.1016/J.DCN.2022.101164; 10.1017/S0033291721003135; 10.1016/J.BPSC.2022.01.006; 10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031912-114413; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.0426; 10.1542/PEDS.2020-049702","Declaration of interests No interests are declared.","Department of Psychology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA."

We tested the hypothesis that a syndrome of despair-related maladies at midlife is preceded by psychopathology during adolescence. Participants are members of a representative cohort of 1037 individuals born in Dunedin, New Zealand in 1972-73 and followed to age 45 years, with 94% retention. Adolescent mental disorders were assessed in three diagnostic assessments at ages 11, 13, and 15 years. Indicators of despair-related maladies across four domains - suicidality, substance misuse, sleep problems, and pain - were assessed at age 45 using multi-modal measures including self-report, informant-report, and national register data. We identified and validated a syndrome of despair-related maladies at midlife involving suicidality, substance misuse, sleep problems, and pain. Adults who exhibited a more severe syndrome of despair-related maladies at midlife tended to have had early-onset emotional and behavioral disorders [<i>&#x3b2;</i> = 0.23, 95% CI (0.16-0.30), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001], even after adjusting for sex, childhood SES, and childhood IQ. A more pronounced midlife despair syndrome was observed among adults who, as adolescents, were diagnosed with a greater number of mental disorders [<i>&#x3b2;</i> = 0.26, 95% CI (0.19-0.33), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001]. Tests of diagnostic specificity revealed that associations generalized across different adolescent mental disorders. Midlife adults who exhibited a more severe syndrome of despair-related maladies tended to have had psychopathology as adolescents.

Yet it remains unclear whether and how socioeconomic status (SES) affects gestational PAH exposure. To examine whether there are socioeconomic disparities in PAHs exposure among pregnant women from Rochester, NY, and if so, to what extent disproportionate proximity to air pollution sources, measured by residential distance to transportation-related sources, contributed to the exposure disparity. We measured 1-hydroxypyrene concentrations in 726 urine samples collected from 305 pregnant women up to three samples throughout pregnancy. Residential distances to transportation-related sources were calculated based on participants' home addresses. We used linear mixed-effects models with random intercepts of participants to examine associations between 1-hydroxypyrene, SES indicators, and distance to transportation-related sources. We used structural equation modelling to assess to what extent distance to transportation-related sources contributes to the socioeconomic disparity in 1-hydroxypyrene concentrations. Reduced household income and maternal education level were both significant SES predictors of 1-hydroxypyrene concentrations, after the adjustment for other maternal demographic characteristics. Each&#xa0;interquartile range (IQR) increases in residential proximity to the airport (from 14.3 to 6.0&#x2009;km), the railroad yard (from 22.3 to 6.0&#x2009;km), and annual average daily traffic within 300&#x2009;m (from 3796 to 99,933 vehicles/year) were associated with 15.0% (95%CI: 7.0-22.2%), 15.4% (95%CI: 6.5-23.5%), and 13.6% (95%CI: 4.7-23.3%) increases in 1-hydroxypyrene concentrations, respectively. Proximity to these sources jointly explained 10% (95%CI: 1.6-18.4%) of the 1-hydroxypyrene concentration change associated with decreases in SES as a latent variable defined by both household income and education level. Our findings suggest that efforts to address disproportionate residential proximity to transportation-related sources may reduce the socioeconomic disparity in PAH exposure.",2023,5,9,"Journal of exposure science &amp; environmental epidemiology","10.1038/s41370-023-00555-9",NA,"J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol","eng",NA,NA,"R01 ES027495","10.1289/ehp.5742; 10.1186/1476-069X-10-89; 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141581; 10.1289/ehp.10958; 10.1186/s12989-020-00386-8; 10.1038/s41467-019-11654-3; 10.1016/j.reprotox.2013.01.008; 10.1073/pnas.1105209108; 10.1016/j.envint.2013.07.019; 10.1007/s11356-017-9315-8; 10.1016/j.envint.2015.09.003; 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.07.070; 10.1016/j.envres.2021.111614; 10.1016/j.envpol.2017.09.087; 10.1007/s11869-020-00969-6; 10.1007/s11356-021-16030-7; 10.1289/EHP8584; 10.1007/s40572-015-0069-5; 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044798; 10.1016/j.envint.2021.106656; 10.3390/metabo9100198; 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.03.073; 10.1080/10962247.2012.671792; 10.1056/NEJMoa1702747; 10.1016/j.envres.2021.112534; 10.1007/s00420-021-01822-8; 10.1016/j.envint.2021.106535; 10.1016/j.envres.2019.109048; 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.103; 10.1016/j.envres.2014.11.022; 10.1016/j.envint.2021.106405; 10.1016/j.envres.2021.111169; 10.1021/acs.est.5b04629; 10.1021/es5001566; 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.10.043; 10.1021/acs.est.0c05933; 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.05.016; 10.1021/acs.est.6b01815; 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.02.015; 10.3390/ijerph15102177; 10.1289/EHP5732; 10.1021/acs.est.1c01549; 10.1021/es100008x; 10.1080/02786820701213511; 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147234; 10.1002/2015JD023628; 10.1111/j.0735-2166.2004.00215.x; 10.1016/j.pmedr.2018.10.020; 10.1016/j.envpol.2013.10.005; 10.1016/j.ijheh.2022.114048",NA,"Nicholas School of the Environment &amp; Duke Global Health Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA."

We examined the association between attention bias and anxiety among rural Latinx youth and investigated potential moderators of this relationship. Clinical symptoms, demographic characteristics, and a performance-based measure of attention bias were collected from 66 rural Latinx youth with clinical levels of anxiety (33.3% female; M<sub>age</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;11.74; 92.4% Latinx, 7.6% Mixed Latinx). No moderating effects for age or gender were found.

We take a developmentally-sensitive approach to examine the neurodevelopmental sequelae of early adversity in a preregistered meta-analysis of 27,234 youth (birth to 18-years-old), providing the largest group of adversity-exposed youth to date. Findings demonstrate that early-life adversity does not have an ontogenetically uniform impact on brain volumes, but instead exhibits age-, experience-, and region-specific associations. Relative to non-exposed comparisons, interpersonal early adversity (e.g., family-based maltreatment) was associated with initially larger volumes in frontolimbic regions until &#x223c;10-years-old, after which these exposures were linked to increasingly smaller volumes. By contrast, socioeconomic disadvantage (e.g., poverty) was associated with smaller volumes in temporal-limbic regions in childhood, which were attenuated at older ages.

A second aim is to investigate the moderating roles of socioeconomic status and sex in these trends. The analysis is based on repeated cross-sectional data 2004-2020 among grade 9 students in secondary schools in a Swedish county. In total, data from 19,873 students were included in the analysis. We fitted linear and logistic regression equations and used survey-years' coefficients to estimate the trends. We also estimated the moderating effects of socioeconomic status and sex using interactions between survey year and socioeconomic status and sex, respectively. The trends in all mental health problems declined over time. Through its interaction with survey year, socioeconomic status moderated the trends; psychosomatic symptoms (B = -0.115, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), depressive symptoms (B = -0.084, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001) and suicidal ideations (odds ratio 0.953, confidence interval 0.924-0.983) significantly declined over time among those with high socioeconomic status. However, socioeconomic status did not have an association with the trend in suicide attempts. Interaction between sex and year of survey was associated with significant decreasing trends in depressive symptoms and suicidal ideations only among girls. <b>Adolescent mental health problems have decreased over time, but only for adolescents with high socioeconomic status, or only in depressive symptoms and suicidal ideations for girls.

Lower socioeconomic status (SES) is one risk factor for poor metabolic health, and may be related to limited access to healthful and affordable foods (e.g., living in a food desert). This study evaluates the respective contributions of SES and food desert severity on metabolic health during pregnancy. The food desert severity of 302 pregnant individuals was determined using the United States Department of Agriculture Food Access Research Atlas. SES was measured using total household income adjusted for household size, years of education, and amount of reserve savings. Information about participants' glucose concentrations one hour following an oral glucose tolerance test during the second trimester was extracted from medical records and percent adiposity during the second trimester was assessed using air displacement plethysmography. Information about participants' nutritional intake during the second trimester was obtained by trained nutritionists via three unannounced 24-h dietary recalls. Structural equation models showed that lower SES predicted higher food desert severity (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#xa0;0.20, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008) and higher adiposity (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#xa0;0.27, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.016) and consumption of a more pro-inflammatory diet (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#xa0;0.25, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003) during the second trimester of pregnancy. Higher food desert severity also predicted higher percent adiposity during the second trimester (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.17, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013). Food desert severity significantly mediated the relationship between lower SES and higher percent adiposity during the second trimester (&#x3b2;<sub>indirect</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#xa0;0.03, 95% CI [-&#xa0;0.079, -&#xa0;0.004]).

"37082035","Does gender moderate the association between socioeconomic status and health? Results from an observational study in persons with spinal cord injury living in Morocco.","Regula Limacher, Abderrazak Hajjioui, Maryam Fourtassi, Christine Fekete","Socioeconomic status (SES) and gender are well-known social determinants of health. However, their impact on health in populations with physical disabilities in low-resource countries is still lacking. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate associations of individual SES with health and the moderating effect of gender on this association in a Moroccan population with a physical disability, namely spinal cord injury. Cross-sectional survey data from 385 participants with spinal cord injury living in Morocco were analyzed. SES was operationalized by education level, household income, financial hardship, and subjective social status. Health indicators included secondary conditions, pain, vitality, quality of life, and general health. Associations between SES and health indicators were investigated using linear and logistic regressions. To test the potential moderation of gender, interaction terms between SES and gender were introduced in regression models. Financial hardship and lower subjective social status were associated with poorer health outcomes in four out of five indicators in the total sample. In contrast, education and income were inconsistently associated with health. Overall, gender did not moderate the association between SES and health, except that educational inequalities in general health were more pronounced in women, and the observation of a trend for a stronger negative effect of subjective social status on men's than woman's health (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). This study revealed that subjective indicators of SES negatively impact on health, whereas evidence for the moderating role of gender in this association was weak. These findings underline the importance to reduce social marginalization and poverty in populations with disabilities in low-resource countries to reduce their double burden of living with a disability and encountering social disadvantages through low SES.",2023,1,1,"Frontiers in rehabilitation sciences","10.3389/fresc.2023.1108214","PMC10110871","Front Rehabil Sci","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1056/NEJMsa0707519; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61228-8; 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)71146-6; 10.3402/gha.v8.27106; 10.1186/1475-9276-10-23; 10.1186/1475-9276-5-1; 10.1080/09638288.2021.2003451; 10.1007/s10654-017-0286-3; 10.1371/journal.pone.0090130; 10.1080/10790268.2006.11753852; 10.1016/j.apmr.2012.02.004; 10.2340/16501977-2039; 10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100854; 10.1186/s12939-019-1112-1; 10.3390/ijerph18084272; 10.4102/ajod.v3i2.80; 10.1016/j.jns.2017.02.018; 10.13016/avw3-9cvx; 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2019.05.011; 10.1177/1090198112463021; 10.1016/S0277-9536(02)00131-4; 10.1097/YCO.0000000000000083; 10.1177/1359105318800804; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.03.038; 10.1371/journal.pone.0034799; 10.1080/17441690801900795; 10.1016/j.apmr.2020.01.022; 10.1097/PHM.0000000000000622; 10.1590/1413-81232018234.16972016; 10.1007/s12529-011-9206-1; 10.1080/10790268.2007.11753924; 10.1016/j.jphys.2015.07.001; 10.1080/10790268.2007.11753405; 10.1186/1477-7525-8-94; 10.1186/s12955-018-0858-2; 10.1038/s41393-021-00663-z; 10.3389/ijph.2022.1604673; 10.1002/acr.21677; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.10.030; 10.1056/NEJM199712253372606; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.05.008; 10.1186/1756-0500-5-381; 10.1037/rep0000248; 10.1371/journal.pone.0212184; 10.1186/s12916-018-1246-9","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","Swiss Paraplegic Research, Guido A.

Both racial discrimination and neighborhood poverty are factors that contribute to this health disparity. However, studies focused on the intersection of these two oppressive systems on PTSD symptoms are lacking. To address this gap in the literature, we assessed the interactive effects of racial discrimination and neighborhood poverty on PTSD symptoms in an urban sample of trauma-exposed Black women (<i>N</i> = 300). Simple moderation analysis was used to assess the main and interactive effects of racial discrimination and neighborhood poverty on PTSD symptoms. The overall model significantly predicted PTSD symptoms, with a main effect of racial discrimination (<i>B</i> = 1.87, <i>p</i> = .009) and neighborhood poverty rate (<i>B</i> = 0.29, <i>p</i> = .008), independent of prior trauma exposure and percentage of Black residents in the zip code. More frequent experiences of racial discrimination and higher rates of neighborhood poverty both predicted higher PTSD symptoms. There was also a trending interaction of racial discrimination and neighborhood poverty (<i>B</i> = -0.05, <i>p</i> = .054), where the effect of neighborhood poverty on PTSD symptoms was only present for those who reported fewer experiences of racial discrimination. Our results suggest that people who have experienced more instances of racial discrimination show high levels of PTSD symptoms regardless of neighborhood poverty rates and highlight the importance of considering multiple levels of oppression that Black individuals face while diagnosing and treating stress-related psychopathology.

Mental illness (MI) is prevalent among violently injured individuals. The relationship between preexisting MI and violent reinjury among women has not been fully characterized. Our objective was to determine if risk of hospital reencounter-violent reinjury and all-cause-was associated with preexisting MI at time of index injury among female victims of violence. All females (15-100 + years) presenting to a level I trauma center with violent injury (2002-2019) surviving to discharge were included (N = 1,056). Exposure was presence of preexisting MI. The primary outcome was hospital reencounters for violent reinjury and all-cause within one year (through 2020). The secondary outcome was the development of a new MI within one year of index injury. Odds of reencounter and development of new MI for those with and without preexisting MI were compared with multivariable logistic regression, stratified for interaction when appropriate. There were 404 women (38%) with preexisting MI at time of index injury. Approximately 11% of patients with preexisting MI experienced violent reinjury compared to 5% of those without within 1 year ( p &lt; 0.001). Specifically, those with MI in the absence of concomitant substance use had more than three times the odds of violent reinjury (adjusted Odds Ratio, 3.52 (1.57, 7.93); p = 0.002). Of those with preexisting MI, 64% had at least one reencounter for any reason compared to 46% of those without ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . Odds of all-cause reencounter for those with preexisting MI were nearly twice of those without (adjusted Odds Ratio, 1.81 [1.36, 2.42]; p &lt; 0.0001). Among female victims of violence, preexisting MI is associated with a significantly increased risk of hospital reencounter and violent reinjury within the first year after index injury. Recognition of this vulnerable population and improved efforts at addressing MI in trauma patients is critical to ongoing prevention efforts to reduce violent reinjury.

In adults, exposure to early life adversity, including low socioeconomic status (SES), is predictive of shorter TL. However, results in pediatric populations have been mixed. Defining the true relation between TL and SES in childhood is expected to enhance the understanding of the biological pathways through which socioeconomic factors influence health across the life span. The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically review and quantitatively assess the published literature to better understand how SES, race, and TL are related in pediatric populations. Studies in the United States in any pediatric population with any measure of SES were included and identified through the following electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Medline, Socindex, CINAHL, and Psychinfo. Analysis utilized a multi-level random-effects meta-analysis accounting for multiple effect sizes within a study. Thirty-two studies were included with a total of 78 effect sizes that were categorized into income-based, education-based, and composite indicators. Only three studies directly tested the relation between SES and TL as the primary study aim. In the full model, there was a significant relation between SES and TL (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0220 p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0286). Analysis by type of SES categorization identified a significant moderating effect of income on TL (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0480, 95% CI: 0.0155 to 0.0802, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0045) but no significant effect for education or composite SES. There is an overall association between SES and TL that is predominately due to the association with income-based SES measures implicating income disparities as a key target for efforts to address health inequity across the life span. Identification of associations between family income and biological changes in children that predict life-span health risk provides key data to support public health policies addressing economic inequality in families and presents a unique opportunity to assess the effect of prevention efforts at the biologic level.",2023,6,1,"SSM - population health","10.1016/j.ssmph.2023.101380","PMC10102414","SSM Popul Health","eng",NA,NA,"U24 AG066528","NA",NA,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Tulane University School of Medicine, 1430 Tulane Avenue, New Orleans, LA, 70112, USA."
"37036974","Heterogeneity of depression across the socioeconomic spectrum.","Yu Hao, Martha J Farah","Why is lower socioeconomic status associated with higher rates of depression? And, is the surplus of depression at lower SES just more of the same type as depression found at higher levels, or is it distinctive? We addressed these questions by examining the relations among SES, amygdala volume, and symptoms of depression in healthy young adults. Amygdala volume, a risk factor for depression, does not synergize with SES in a diathesis-stress relation, nor does it mediate the relation of SES to depression. Rather, SES and amygdala volume are independent, additive risk factors. They are also associated with different depression symptoms and, whereas perceived stress fully mediates the relation of SES to depression, it has no relation to amygdala volume. These findings suggest heterogeneity of depression across the socioeconomic spectrum, with implications for treatment selection as well as for future genetic and brain studies.",2023,4,18,"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","10.1073/pnas.2222069120","PMC10119997","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","eng","D055815; D006801; D003863; D001921; D012923; D000679; D012307; D012959","Young Adult; Humans; Depression; Brain; Social Class; Amygdala; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors",NA,"10.1037/t02889-000; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.02.018; 10.15288/jsa.1994.55.149","The authors declare no competing interest.","Center for Neuroscience &amp; Society, The Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania,&#xa0;Philadelphia, PA 19104."

We evaluated the implementation of a rolling enrollment adaptation of an evidence-based tobacco treatment group intervention, Courage to Quit&#xae;-Rolling (CTQ&#xae;-R). The 4-session CTQ&#xae;-R incorporating psychoeducation, motivational enhancement, and cognitive behavioral skills was evaluated by examining feasibility and preliminary program outcomes with a pre-post design using the SQUIRE method in a sample of 289 primarily low-income, Black people who smoke. Feasibility was measured by examining program retention. Paired t-tests evaluated changes in behavioral intentions and knowledge about smoking cessation and differences in average daily cigarettes smoked from first to last session attended. CTQ-R was feasible to implement in an urban medical center program enrolling primarily low-income Black people who smoke, with 52% attending at least 2 sessions and 24% completing the full program. Participants demonstrated improvements in knowledge of smoking cessation strategies and confidence in quitting (ps&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.004). Preliminary effectiveness analyses showed a 30% reduction in average daily cigarette use, with group completers reporting greater reduction than non-completers. CTQ&#xae;-R is feasible and showed preliminary effectiveness for increasing knowledge about stop smoking skills and reducing cigarette smoking. A rolling enrollment smoking group treatment is feasible and may be effective among people who smoke who face historical and systemic barriers to tobacco treatment engagement.

We found no published reviews on the biology of SDoHs in schizophrenia-spectrum psychotic disorders (SSPD). We present an overview of pathophysiological mechanisms and neurobiological processes plausibly involved in the effects of major SDoHs on clinical outcomes in SSPD. This review of the biology of SDoHs focuses on early-life adversities, poverty, social disconnection, discrimination including racism, migration, disadvantaged neighborhoods, and food insecurity. These factors interact with psychological and biological factors to increase the risk and worsen the course and prognosis of schizophrenia. Published studies on the topic are limited by cross-sectional design, variable clinical and biomarker assessments, heterogeneous methods, and a lack of control for confounding variables. Drawing on preclinical and clinical studies, we propose a biological framework to consider the likely pathogenesis. Putative systemic pathophysiological processes include epigenetics, allostatic load, accelerated aging with inflammation (inflammaging), and the microbiome. These processes affect neural structures, brain function, neurochemistry, and neuroplasticity, impacting the development of psychosis, quality of life, cognitive impairment, physical comorbidities, and premature mortality. Our model provides a framework for research that could lead to developing specific strategies for prevention and treatment of the risk factors and biological processes, thereby improving the quality of life and increasing the longevity of people with SSPD. Biology of SDoHs in SSPD is an exciting area of research that points to innovative multidisciplinary team science for improving the course and prognosis of these serious psychiatric disorders.",2023,7,4,"Schizophrenia bulletin","10.1093/schbul/sbad031","PMC10318888","Schizophr Bull","eng","D006801; D012559; D011788; D003430; D064890; D011618; D001695","Humans; Schizophrenia; Quality of Life; Cross-Sectional Studies; Social Determinants of Health; Psychotic Disorders; Biology","K23 MH121792; R01 MH094151; P50 MH100023; MH110418; U01 DA041120; 2R01MH094151-08; R01 MH066031; P51 OD011132; R01 MH104964; R01 MH113883","NA",NA,"Center for Translational Social Neuroscience, Department of Psychiatry, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA."

Analysis of data from seven international cohorts of first-episode psychosis (FEP) with cognitive data at baseline (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;683) and follow-up data on antipsychotic treatment response: 605 treatment responsive and 78 treatment resistant cases. Cognitive measures were grouped into seven cognitive domains based on the pre-existing literature. We ran multiple imputation for missing data and used logistic regression to test for associations between cognitive performance at FEP and treatment resistant status at follow-up. On average patients who were future classified as treatment resistant reported poorer performance across most cognitive domains at baseline. Univariate logistic regressions showed that antipsychotic treatment resistance cases had significantly poorer IQ/general cognitive functioning at FEP (OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.70, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.003). These findings remained significant after adjusting for additional variables in multivariable analyses (OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.76, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.049). Although replication in larger studies is required, it appears that deficits in IQ/general cognitive functioning at first episode are associated with future treatment resistance.

Here we assessed one possible contributor to this disparity, a cognitive bias in the interpretation of negative events, in a group of 341 9-year-olds (49% female, 94% White) ranging widely in SES. This cognitive bias, known as pessimism in the attributional style literature, is the tendency to interpret negative events as persistent (Stable) and pervasive (Global). It was found to be more common among lower SES children (effect sizes&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.18-0.24 depending on SES measures: income to needs ratio, proportion of poverty from birth to age 9, and parental educational attainment). Moreover, persistent, pervasive adversity in children's lives predicted this bias and mediated the SES-pessimism link. Pessimistic attributional style, in turn, was related to childhood emotional problems and mediated the relation between SES and these problems. Finally, evidence for serial mediation of the SES-mental health problems relationship was found via persistent, pervasive adversity and pessimism, respectively.",2023,3,30,"Scientific reports","10.1038/s41598-023-32482-y","PMC10063619","Sci Rep","eng","D006801; D002648; D005260; D008297; D008603; D000067657; D012923; D011203; D003071","Humans; Child; Female; Male; Mental Health; Pessimism; Social Class; Poverty; Cognition",NA,"10.1016/S0005-7967(97)00027-2; 10.1037/0033-295X.96.2.358; 10.1037/0021-843X.87.1.49; 10.1080/15374410902851630; 10.1016/0272-7358(95)00046-1; 10.1037/0278-6133.4.3.219; 10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.1063; 10.1016/j.tics.2014.02.003; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2006.10.006; 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2006.00404.x; 10.1007/s12529-008-9018-0; 10.1080/00224545.1984.9922841; 10.1037/0021-843X.93.2.235; 10.1080/00224545.1989.9712062; 10.1080/00224545.1990.9924569; 10.1037/0003-066X.59.2.77; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05336.x; 10.1037/0033-2909.128.2.330; 10.1037/a0031808; 10.1111/jasp.12356; 10.1023/A:1010333815728; 10.1037/0022-006X.75.1.9; 10.1126/science.1260799; 10.1001/jama.290.15.2023; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.05.036; 10.1037/0012-1649.39.5.924; 10.1017/S0954579420001947; 10.1037/0022-006X.68.3.526; 10.1007/BF01324858; 10.1007/BF00938033","The authors declare no competing interests.","Center for Neuroscience and Society, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."
"36988737","Under pressure: the interaction between high-stakes contexts and individual differences in decision-making in humans and non-human species.","Meghan J Sosnowski, Sarah F Brosnan","Observed behavior can be the result of complex cognitive processes that are influenced by environmental factors, physiological process, and situational features. Pressure, a feature of a situation in which an individual's outcome is impacted by his or her own ability to perform, has been traditionally treated as a human-specific phenomenon and only recently have pressure-related deficits been considered in relation to other species. However, there are strong similarities in biological and cognitive systems among mammals (and beyond), and high-pressure situations are at least theoretically common in the wild. We hypothesize that other species are sensitive to pressure and that we can learn about the evolutionary trajectory of pressure responses by manipulating pressure experimentally in these other species. Recent literature indicates that, as in humans, pressure influences responses in non-human primates, with either deficits in ability to perform (""choking"") or an ability to thrive when the stakes are high. Here, we synthesize the work to date on performance under pressure in humans and how hormones might be related to individual differences in responses. Then, we discuss why we would expect to see similar effects of pressure in non-humans and highlight the existing evidence for how other species respond. We argue that evidence suggests that other species respond to high-pressure contexts in similar ways as humans, and that responses to pressure are a critical missing piece of our understanding of cognition in human and non-human animals. Understanding pressure's effects could provide insight into individual variation in decision-making in comparative cognition and the evolution of human decision-making.",2023,7,1,"Animal cognition","10.1007/s10071-023-01768-z","PMC10345073","Anim Cogn","Language Research Center, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA. meg.sosnowski@gmail.com.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Brosnan</LastName><ForeName>Sarah F</ForeName><Initials>SF</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, Georgia State University, P.O.

Our secondary objective was to identify the disparity trends and overall imaging utilization as compared with years 2005 and 2010. This was a retrospective, population-based study that utilized the GCNKSS (Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Study) data. Patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack were identified in the years 2005, 2010, and 2015 in a metropolitan population of 1.3 million. The proportion of imaging use within 2 days of stroke/transient ischemic attack onset or hospital admission date was computed. SES determined by the percentage below the poverty level within a given respondent's US census tract of residence was dichotomized. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the odds of advanced neuroimaging use (computed tomography angiogram/magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiogram) for age, race, gender, and SES. There was a total of 10&#x2009;526 stroke/transient ischemic attack events in the combined study year periods of 2005, 2010, and 2015. The utilization of advanced imaging progressively increased (48% in 2005, 63% in 2010, and 75% in 2015 [<i>P</i>&lt;0.001]). In the combined study year multivariable model, advanced imaging was associated with age and SES. Younger patients (&#x2264;55 years) were more likely to have advanced imaging compared with older patients (adjusted odds ratio, 1.85 [95% CI, 1.62-2.12]; <i>P</i>&lt;0.01), and low SES patients were less likely to have advanced imaging compared with high SES (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.75-0.93]; <i>P</i>&lt;0.01). A significant interaction was found between age and race. Stratified by age, the adjusted odds of advanced imaging were higher for Black patients compared with White patients among older patients (&gt;55 years; adjusted odds ratio, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.15-1.57]; <i>P</i>&lt;0.01), but no racial differences among the young. Racial, age, and SES-related disparities exist in the utilization of advanced neuroimaging for patients with acute stroke.

Our previous work found a positive association between higher curiosity and higher academic achievement at kindergarten, with a greater magnitude of benefit for children with socioeconomic disadvantage. Because characteristics of the early caregiving and physical environment impact the processes that underlie early learning, we sought to examine early environmental experiences associated with early childhood curiosity, in hopes of identifying modifiable contexts that may promote its expression. Using data from a nationally representative sample of 4,750 children from the United States, this study examined the association of multi-level ecological contexts (i.e., neighborhood safety, parenting quality, home environment, and center-based preschool enrollment) on early childhood curiosity at kindergarten, and tested for moderation by socioeconomic status. In adjusted, stratified models, children from lower-resourced environments (characterized by the lowest-SES tertile) manifested higher curiosity if they experienced more positive parenting, higher quality home environments, and if they lived in ""very safe"" neighborhoods. We discuss the ecological contexts (i.e., parenting, home, and neighborhood environments) that are promotive of early childhood curiosity, with an emphasis on the role of the neighborhood safety and the ""neighborhood built environment"" as important modifiable contexts to foster early childhood curiosity in lower-resourced families.",2023,1,1,"Frontiers in psychology","10.3389/fpsyg.2023.986221","PMC10011070","Front Psychol","eng",NA,NA,"K08 HD078506","10.1037/dev0000923; 10.1016/j.cognition.2011.03.003; 10.1353/hpu.2013.0018; 10.1111/bjop.12266; 10.1038/s41390-018-0099-4; 10.1177/1529100615569721; 10.1037/amp0000741; 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01717; 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2012.00783.x; 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2012.00796.x; 10.1037/dev0000366; 10.1016/j.healthplace.2017.04.012; 10.2105/ajph.91.11.1808; 10.1016/j.jecp.2020.104934; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01614.x; 10.1037/0012-1649.43.4.1045; 10.1371/journal.pone.0258572; 10.1038/s41390-018-0039-3; 10.3390/ijerph17217926; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116536; 10.1080/09297049.2023.2172150; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2013.08.002; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01540.x; 10.1542/peds.2008-2267","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","Division of Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics, Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, United States."

The biological sensitivity to context theory suggests that respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) indexes youths' varying susceptibility to rearing contexts. However, self-regulation in the family context is increasingly viewed as a process of ""coregulation"" that is biologically embedded and involves dynamic Parent&#xd7;Child interactions. No research thus far has examined physiological synchrony as a dyadic biological context that may moderate associations between parenting behaviors and preadolescent adjustment. Using a two-wave sample of 101 low-socioeconomic status (SES) families (children and caretakers; mean age 10.28 years), we employed multilevel modeling to examine dyadic coregulation during a conflict task, indicated by RSA synchrony, as a moderator of the linkages between observed parenting behaviors and preadolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems. Results showed that high dyadic RSA synchrony resulted in a multiplicative association between parenting and youth adjustment. High dyadic synchrony intensified the relations between parenting behaviors and youth behavior problems, such that in the context of high dyadic synchrony, positive and negative parenting behaviors were associated with decreased and increased behavioral problems, respectively. Parent-child dyadic RSA synchrony is discussed as a potential biomarker of biological sensitivity in youth.",2023,2,1,"Development and psychopathology","10.1017/S095457942100078X",NA,"Dev Psychopathol","eng","D006801; D000293; D002648; D065809; D010287; D016487; D010290; D000066553","Humans; Adolescent; Child; Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia; Parent-Child Relations; Parenting; Parents; Problem Behavior","K01 DA045219","NA",NA,"Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience Program, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA."
"36911114","Childhood adverse events and <i>BDNF</i> promoter methylation in later-life.","Aoshuang Zhou, Marie-Laure Ancelin, Karen Ritchie, Joanne Ryan","Studies have shown that the effects of early-life stress and trauma can be enduring, with long-term negative effects on health. Epigenetics, including DNA methylation, have been implicated as a potential mechanism for these effects. Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) is a neurotransmitter involved in learning and memory, and altered <i>BDNF</i> promoter methylation measured in peripheral tissue has been found with early-life stress. However, whether such methylation differences remain stable into later life, is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the association between childhood adversity and <i>BDNF</i> promoter methylation in adults aged 65 years and over. Data came from a large study of older community-dwelling individuals in France (ESPRIT). Information on three major childhood adverse events, namely abuse/maltreatment, war/natural disaster, and financial difficulties/poverty, was obtained by retrospective reporting from participants of ESPRIT study. <i>BDNF</i> promoter I and IV methylation was assessed in blood and buccal tissue. Linear regression analysis was performed, adjusting for age, sex, education, depression, and morbidity. Among 927 participants, there was no strong evidence that childhood abuse/maltreatment or financial difficulties/poverty were associated with <i>BDNF</i> methylation in older individuals. For war/natural disaster, differential methylation at four of twenty-nine CpG sites was observed, however, these would not have remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Together, these findings do not support a long-term association between adverse childhood events and <i>BDNF</i> methylation in older age, but further large prospective studies are needed, which do not target specific genes, but consider DNA methylation across the genome.",2023,1,1,"Frontiers in psychiatry","10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1108485","PMC9998928","Front Psychiatry","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/s2468-2667(17)30118-4; 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032816-045005; 10.1007/s10896-009-9269-9; 10.1093/eurpub/ckw253; 10.3109/10253890.2015.1038992; 10.1111/acps.12675; 10.1542/peds.2015-3075; 10.1038/ng1089; 10.1038/hdy.2010.54; 10.1101/cshperspect.a019133; 10.1111/aogs.12431; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.03.003; 10.1016/j.ynstr.2021.100336; 10.1038/nn.2270; 10.1515/revneuro.1997.8.1.1; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2012.08.034; 10.1073/pnas.1114122109; 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110188; 10.3389/fpsyt.2021.768680; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.04.010; 10.1080/15592294.2015.1039221; 10.2217/epi-2021-0015; 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2018.12.012; 10.1080/15592294.2017.1341026; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.11.028; 10.1002/dev.21218; 10.3389/fnhum.2020.594244; 10.1192/bjp.184.2.147; 10.4088/JCP.08m04510; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2019.104492; 10.1016/j.jad.2022.02.062; 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2014.12.035; 10.1016/j.jad.2014.07.022; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.9; 10.1016/j.neures.2013.08.004; 10.3233/jad-190738; 10.1038/tp.2015.114; 10.1073/pnas.0507816102; 10.1159/000350716; 10.1038/tp.2012.140; 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2014.04.010; 10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2019.05.002; 10.2174/1567202611666140829162158; 10.1038/nn1276; 10.1073/pnas.0507526103; 10.1038/mp.2012.38; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.07.009; 10.1007/s00228-018-2463-z; 10.3390/ijms231911729; 10.1371/journal.pone.0239335; 10.1146/annurev.neuro.24.1.677; 10.1002/cyto.a.22161; 10.1016/j.ygeno.2007.05.004; 10.1186/s12993-016-0101-4; 10.1126/science.1090842; 10.1111/j.1440-1819.2010.02135.x; 10.3390/ijms18030571; 10.1016/j.jad.2020.02.002; 10.1080/15622975.2016.1245443; 10.1126/science.277.5332.1659; 10.1371/journal.pone.0030148; 10.1038/tp.2011.60; 10.1017/s0954579416000870; 10.1038/tp.2016.112; 10.1016/j.bbi.2016.10.006; 10.1371/journal.pone.0119061; 10.1542/peds.2014-1395; 10.1073/pnas.1315458110; 10.1177/0956797615626703","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia."

Increasing work participation for people with persistent pain improves their health, quality of life, and well-being and reduces poverty; however, it is not clear how to best help unemployed people who have persistent pain to return to work. The aim of this study is to examine if a matched work placement intervention featuring case manager support and work-focused healthcare improves return to work rates and quality of life for unemployed people in Norway with persistent pain who want to work. We will use a cohort randomised controlled approach to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a matched work placement intervention featuring case manager support and work-focused healthcare compared to those receiving usual care in the cohort alone. We will recruit people aged 18-64, who have been out of work for at least 1&#xa0;month, had pain for more than 3&#xa0;months, and want to work. Initially, all (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;228) will be recruited to an observational cohort study on the impact of being unemployed with persistent pain. We will then randomly select one in three to be offered the intervention. The primary outcome of sustained return to work will be measured using registry and self-reported data, while secondary outcomes include self-reported levels of health-related quality of life and physical and mental health. Outcomes will be measured at baseline and 3, 6, and 12&#xa0;months post-randomisation. We will run a process evaluation parallel to the intervention exploring implementation, continuity of the intervention, reasons for participating, declining participation, and mechanisms behind cases of sustained return to work. An economic evaluation of the trial process will also be conducted. The ReISE intervention is designed to increase work participation for people with persistent pain. The intervention has the potential to improve work ability by collaboratively navigating obstacles to working. If successful, the intervention may be a viable option for helping people in this population.

Ses-treated groups received 30&#xa0;mg/kg of Ses once a day by oral gavage for four weeks. After the treatment period, the animals were positioned in a stereotaxic device for surgery and field potential recording. The population spike (PS) amplitude and slope of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) were evaluated in the DG region. Serum oxidative stress biomarkers (total oxidant status (TOS) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC)) were measured. A&#x3b2; impaired LTP induction at the PP-DG synapses evidenced by a decrease in EPSP slope and PS amplitude of LTP. In A&#x3b2; rats, Ses increased EPSP slope and PS amplitude of LTP in the DG granular cells. Also, an increase in TOS and a reduction in TAC caused by A&#x3b2; were significantly corrected by Ses. Ses could prevent A&#x3b2;-induced LTP impairment at the PP-DG synapses in male rats, which can be due to its preventive effects on oxidative stress.",2023,6,1,"Metabolic brain disease","10.1007/s11011-023-01191-w",NA,"Metab Brain Dis","eng","D051381; D008297; D000818; D000544; D017774; D017208; D006624; D016229; D010446; D018384; D000975","Rats; Male; Animals; Alzheimer Disease; Long-Term Potentiation; Rats, Wistar; Hippocampus; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Peptide Fragments; Oxidative Stress; Antioxidants",NA,"10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.08.012; 10.2174/138161210793176572; 10.1080/01616412.2021.1893565; 10.1016/j.brainresbull.2021.02.024; 10.1016/j.bbr.2017.08.047; 10.1007/s11011-017-9960-0; 10.1016/j.brainresbull.2018.01.008; 10.1016/j.biopha.2017.01.123; 10.1038/mp.2016.111; 10.1038/nrn2335; 10.1113/jphysiol.1973.sp010273; 10.1186/alzrt175; 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(20000401)60:1&lt;65::AID-JNR7&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q; 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2014.11.016; 10.3389/fnagi.2019.00232; 10.1007/s12017-011-8154-x; 10.1096/fj.09-132928; 10.1016/j.lfs.2019.05.071; 10.1186/1742-2094-8-57; 10.3233/JAD-170969; 10.1016/0163-1047(93)90664-4; 10.1016/j.imlet.2004.10.004; 10.1016/j.brainres.2013.09.029; 10.1007/s11064-015-1531-3; 10.1016/j.bbr.2018.10.002; 10.1016/j.biopha.2018.08.037; 10.1016/j.brainresbull.2017.04.009; 10.1146/annurev.pu.13.050192.002243; 10.1096/fj.201601071R; 10.1073/pnas.91.25.12243; 10.1126/science.285.5435.1870; 10.1016/S0891-5849(96)00629-6; 10.1016/j.brainres.2019.146475; 10.1038/nn.2583; 10.7554/eLife.26991; 10.1016/j.brainres.2015.10.007; 10.1007/s11011-017-0174-2; 10.1016/j.jocn.2005.05.009; 10.1080/01616412.2018.1436872; 10.1515/rns.2011.018; 10.2174/156720508786898451; 10.1016/j.brainres.2016.04.058; 10.1016/j.cell.2005.02.008; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.08-05-01645.1988; 10.1073/pnas.172504199; 10.1007/s12576-019-00696-3; 10.1001/archneurol.2011.31; 10.1038/npp.2017.100; 10.1016/j.bbr.2013.07.051; 10.1016/j.neulet.2016.09.055; 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2018.10.006; 10.1007/s10522-012-9413-4",NA,"Department of Neuroscience, School of Science and Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Shahid Fahmideh Street, Hamadan, Iran."

Marginalised groups that are at risk of poor mental health overall have been particularly impacted. The purpose of this review is to describe the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on marginalised group (i.e. persons who are socio-economically disadvantaged, migrants and members of ethno-racial minorities, experience homelessness) and identified interventions which could be well-suited to prevent and address mental health difficulties. We conducted a literature review of systematic reviews on mental health difficulties since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic and appropriate interventions among marginalised groups published from January 1, 2020 to May 2, 2022, using Google Scholar and PubMed (MEDLINE). Among 792 studies on mental health difficulties among members of marginalised groups identified by keywords, 17 studies met our eligibility&#xa0;criteria. Twelve systematic reviews examining mental health difficulties in one or several marginalised groups during the COVID-19 pandemic and five systematic reviews on interventions that can mitigate the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were retained in our literature review. The mental health of marginalised groups was severely affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most frequently reported mental health difficulties included symptoms of anxiety and depression. Additionally, there are interventions that appear effective and well-suited for marginalised populations, which should be disseminated on a large scale to mitigate the psychiatric burden in these groups and at the population level.",2023,1,1,"Global mental health (Cambridge, England)","10.1017/gmh.2022.56","PMC9947635","Glob Ment Health (Camb)","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1002/wps.20768; 10.1101/2021.05.04.21256517; 10.1371/journal.pone.0240146; 10.1093/pubmed/fdt060; 10.3390/ijerph18136695; 10.3390/ijerph19063219; 10.1590/1516-4446-2020-1582; 10.3390/covid2030022; 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.89; 10.1037/cap0000272; 10.1111/phn.12959; 10.1111/bjc.12331; 10.1101/2020.12.14.20248152; 10.1057/s41599-021-00915-6; 10.3390/ijerph18052470; 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-060804; 10.1038/s41398-022-01946-6; 10.3390/ijerph18084361; 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.28; 10.3389/fpubh.2020.553345; 10.1007/s00787-021-01856-w; 10.1186/s12889-020-08726-1; 10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102066; 10.2196/23365; 10.3390/ijerph18126528; 10.1186/s12992-020-00589-w; 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02143-7; 10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100243; 10.1007/s12603-020-1469-2; 10.1002/wps.20803; 10.2196/26550; 10.3389/fgwh.2020.588372; 10.3892/etm.2021.9675; 10.1371/journal.pone.0254821; 10.1007/s40200-020-00643-9; 10.25646/7059; 10.1371/journal.pone.0244630; 10.1136/jech-2020-215598; 10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.001; 10.1016/j.jad.2022.08.023; 10.1038/s41380-021-01036-x; 10.1016/j.jiph.2022.04.005; 10.3389/fpubh.2020.560389",NA,"Sorbonne Universit&#xe9;, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epid&#xe9;miologie et de Sant&#xe9; Publique, Paris, France."

We take a developmentally-sensitive approach to examine the neurodevelopmental sequelae of early adversity in a preregistered meta-analysis of 27,234 youth (birth to 18-years-old), providing the largest group of adversity-exposed youth to date. Findings demonstrate that early-life adversity does not have an ontogenetically uniform impact on brain volumes, but instead exhibits age-, experience-, and region-specific associations. Relative to non-exposed comparisons, interpersonal early adversity (e.g., family-based maltreatment) was associated with initially larger volumes in frontolimbic regions until ~10-years-old, after which these exposures were linked to increasingly smaller volumes. By contrast, socioeconomic disadvantage (e.g., poverty) was associated with smaller volumes in temporal-limbic regions in childhood, which were attenuated at older ages.

However, a scarcity of literature considers the role of immigrant background. This study's primary objective was to measure the association between organized activity participation and emotional wellbeing among a population-based sample of Grade 7 children in British Columbia, Canada. We also examined whether this relationship depended on immigration background. Our sample included 14,406 children (47.8% female; mean age&#xa0;=&#xa0;12.0&#xa0;years). 9,393 (65.2%) children were of non-immigrant origin (48.9% female; mean age&#xa0;=&#xa0;12.1&#xa0;years). 5,013 children (34.8%) were of immigrant origin (45.8% female; mean age&#xa0;=&#xa0;12.0&#xa0;years; 40.8% first-generation). Participants completed the Middle Years Development Instrument, a self-report survey measuring children's wellbeing and assets. We used odds ratios and the &#x3c7;<sup>2</sup> test to compare the organized activity participation of non-immigrant and immigrant-origin children. We used multiple linear regression to measure associations between participation and indicators of emotional wellbeing and assessed whether associations varied based on immigrant background, controlling for demographic factors and peer belonging. Participation in any activity was similar among non-immigrant and immigrant-origin children (OR<sub>1st-gen</sub>=1.06, <i>p</i>=0.37; OR<sub>2nd-gen</sub>=0.97, <i>p</i>=0.62).

Participants were interviewed with an adapted version of the Southampton Needs Assessment Questionnaire (SNAQ). Non-parametric statistical analysis was utilised for quantitative data and qualitative data were analysed using free coding to identify themes. Thirty adults with CP (median age 34.8&#xa0;years; GMFCS levels I/II/III/IV/V: <i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;6/6/5/7/6; socio-economic status (SES) low/average/high: <i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;8/17/5) were matched for gender, age, and SES. Adults with CP reported a higher unemployment rate and lower level of satisfaction with access to health services than TD peers. Core themes identified by the participants with CP that made community participation more difficult were physical capacity, poor access to accommodation, transport and health services, lack of socialising opportunities, poor universal design, and lack of financial independence. Adults with CP reported experiencing many challenges in their communities. Improved access to health care services and transport, and the universal design of housing and community buildings to accommodate individuals with a disability should be made a priority.Implications for rehabilitationAdults with cerebral palsy (CP) reported that their disability had an impact on their social life, home life, and work life.Accessibility issues have been identified as a major factor affecting adults with CP in a variety of areas, including access to and use of health services, housing, transportation, and community buildings.Adults with CP reported the need for support during the transition to adulthood, especially with developing life skills that will promote living independently in the community as adults with disabilities.",2023,2,22,"Disability and rehabilitation","10.1080/09638288.2023.2177358",NA,"Disabil Rehabil","eng",NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,"Neuroscience Institute, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa."

In this study, prospective associations between neonatal factors and functional outcomes in childhood and adolescence were compared in ELBW survivors with and without borderline intellectual functioning (BIF). Borderline intellectual functioning was defined by IQ&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;85, assessed at 8&#xa0;years. Among 146 ELBW survivors, 48 (33%) had IQ scores under 85, and 98 (67%) had scores equal to or over 85. Group differences in demographic and risk factors were assessed via t-test, chi-squared analysis or non-parametric tests. Neonatal factors that differed between ELBW groups were tested for association with adaptive behaviour assessed at age 5&#xa0;years, and reading and arithmetic skills assessed at ages 8 and 15&#xa0;years, using hierarchical regression models. Extremely low birthweight survivors with BIF had significantly lower birthweights than ELBW survivors without BIF (790 vs. 855&#xa0;g, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01) and were more likely to be born to mothers with lower socioeconomic status (SES) (78% vs. 48%, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01). These ELBW survivors also were more likely to be diagnosed with significant neurosensory impairment (NSI; 35% vs. 19%, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.04), experienced more bronchopulmonary dysplasia (56% vs. 38%, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.04), received more days of respiratory support (median 33 vs. 14&#xa0;days, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01) and remained in hospital for longer periods (median 81 vs. 63&#xa0;days, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.03). Birthweight, familial SES, NSI and duration of respiratory support were significant predictors for one or more outcomes. Across groups, lower familial SES was associated with lower academic scores (Ps&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05), and NSI predicted lower adaptive functioning (Ps&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). Other associations were moderated by group: among ELBW survivors with BIF, heavier birthweights predicted better arithmetic skills, the presence of NSI was associated with poorer arithmetic skills and more ventilation days predicted poorer reading skills. At birth, ELBW survivors with BIF faced more physiological and social disadvantages and required more medical intervention than their ELBW peers without BIF. Smaller birth size, NSI burden and prolonged neonatal ventilatory support displayed gradients of risk for childhood and adolescent academic outcomes across groups. Whereas academic performance in ELBW survivors with BIF was sensitive to variation in birth size, NSI or ventilation days, ELBW survivors without BIF attained thresholds of intellectual ability that were sufficient to support higher levels of academic performance at both ages, regardless of their status on these factors.

"36793997","Persistence on challenging tasks mediates the relationship between childhood poverty and mental health problems.","Yu Hao, Kalee De France, Gary W Evans","Childhood disadvantage is associated with psychological distress throughout the lifespan. Poor children are alleged to give up more often than their more privileged peers when facing challenges. Yet little research has examined the role of task persistence in poverty and mental health. We test whether poverty-related deficits in persistence contribute to the well-documented link between childhood disadvantage and mental health. We used growth curve modeling to analyze three waves (age 9, 13, and 17) of data assessing the trajectories of persistence on challenging tasks and mental health. Childhood poverty is the proportion of time participants lived in poverty from birth to age 9. We found that individuals experiencing more poverty in early childhood demonstrate less persistence and deteriorated mental health from ages 9 to 17. As expected, task persistence accounts for a portion of the robust childhood poverty - worsening mental health association.

The little routinely collected population-level data from Indigenous communities in the region available shows stark inequities in health and well-being. There are 305 Indigenous ethnic groups, speaking 274 languages, spread across the remote national territory, who have endured long-lasting inequities related to poverty, poor health, and limited access to health care. Malnutrition and mental health are key concerns for young people. Building on our Indigenous communities-academic partnerships over the last two decades, we collaborated with young people from the Terena Indigenous ethnic group, village leaders, teachers, parents, and local health practitioners from the Polo Base (community health centres) to obtain their perspectives on important and feasible actions for a youth health promotion programme. The report was conducted in the Terer&#xe9; Village in Mato Grosso do Sul. Concept mapping, a participatory mixed method approach, was conducted in 7 workshops, 15 adults and 40 youths aged 9-17 years. Art-based concept mapping was used with 9 to 11 years old children (N = 20). Concept systems software was used to create concept maps, which were finalised during the workshops. Focused prompts related to factors that may influence the health and happiness of youths. The participatory method gave Terena youths a significant voice in shaping an agenda that can improve their health. Terena youths identified priority actions that clustered under 'Family', 'School', 'Education', 'Socio-economic circumstances', 'Respect' and 'Sport' in response to protecting happiness; and 'Nutrition pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Local environment', and 'Well-being' in response to having a healthy body. Through the participatory lens of concept mapping, youths articulated the interconnectedness of priority actions across these clusters such that behaviours (e.g. Nutrition pattern, drinking water, physical activity) and aspirations (being able to read, to have a good job) were recognised to be dependent on a wider ecology of factors (e.g. loss of eco-systems, parent-child relationships, student- teacher relationships, parental unemployment). In response to developing youth health, Terena adults suggested priority actions that clustered under 'Relationships', 'Health issues', 'Prevention at Polo Base', 'Access to health care', 'Communication with young people', 'Community life', 'Raising awareness' and 'School support'. Their priorities reflected the need for structural transformative actions (e.g. Polo Base and school staff working together) and for embedding actions to protect Indigenous culture (e.g. integrating their cultural knowledge into training programmes). Concept maps of Indigenous youths emphasised the need for a health promotion programme that engages with the structural and social determinants of health to protect their happiness and health, whilst those of adults emphasised the need to address specific health issues through preventative care via a school-Polo Base collaboration. Investment in a co-developed school-Polo-Base health promotion programme, with intersectoral engagement, has potential for making Indigenous health systems responsive to the inequalities of youth health, to yield dividends for healthy ageing trajectories as well as for the health of the next generation.",2023,1,1,"PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0269653","PMC9931109","PLoS One","eng","D000328; D006801; D000293; D002648; D001938; D006293; D003695; D005006; D013334","Adult; Humans; Adolescent; Child; Brazil; Health Promotion; Delivery of Health Care; Ethnicity; Students","MR/R022739/1","10.1590/1806-9282.66.7.861; 10.1186/1471-2458-13-52; 10.1177/1049732305278876; 10.1155/2015/412804; 10.1186/1748-5908-6-104; 10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2007.05.007; 10.1093/jpepsy/jst079; 10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2016.10.006","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, United Kingdom."
"36778520","Adherence to Typical Antipsychotics among Patients with Schizophrenia in Uganda: A Cross-Sectional Study.","Moses Kule, Mark Mohan Kaggwa","There has been a recent transition from typical to atypical antipsychotics in managing schizophrenia. This has been attributed to the acute side effects experienced by patients on typical antipsychotics that lead to nonadherence. However, the treatment cost with typical antipsychotics is cheaper (preferred in low-income settings), and there is no difference in the effectiveness, efficacy, discontinuation rate, or side effect symptom burden with atypical antipsychotics. This study is aimed at determining the prevalence of nonadherence and the associated factors to typical antipsychotics among patients with schizophrenia attending a psychiatric outpatient clinic at a rural tertiary facility in Uganda. A cross-sectional study among 135 patients with schizophrenia for at least six months on typical antipsychotics (mean age of 39.7 (&#xb1;11.9) and 55.6% were female) from a rural tertiary facility in Uganda. Data were collected regarding sociodemographics, adherence, insight for psychosis, attitude towards typical antipsychotics, side effects, satisfaction with medications, and explanations from health workers about medications and side effects. Logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with nonadherence. The prevalence of nonadherence was 16.3%, and the likelihood of being nonadherent was more among the poor (monthly earning below the poverty line). However, having reduced energy was associated with reducing the likelihood of having nonadherence. The prevalence of nonadherence was lower than many previously obtained prevalence and was comparable to nonadherence for atypical antipsychotics. However, to reduce nonadherence, we need all stakeholders (such as the government, insurance companies, and caregivers) to assist patients living in poverty with access to medication.",2023,1,1,"Schizophrenia research and treatment","10.1155/2023/7035893","PMC9918368","Schizophr Res Treatment","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.2174/1568026621666210701103147; 10.1177/20451253211012250; 10.3390/brainsci11020275; 10.2147/PROM.S42735; 10.4088/JCP.v67n1008; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60239-6; 10.1176/appi.ajp.160.8.1396; 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2017.07.001; 10.1177/2054270418758570; 10.1192/bjp.bp.109.066217; 10.1038/mp.2011.143; 10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31135-3; 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01997-8; 10.31887/DCNS.2010.12.3/jkane; 10.1371/journal.pone.0120560; 10.21767/1791-809X.1000520; 10.1097/JCP.0b013e318268ddc0; 10.3109/00048674.2010.493503; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2015.09.006; 10.4102/sajpsychiatry.v24i0.1124; 10.1176/appi.ps.201500056; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2013.03.002; 10.2147/PPA.S41609; 10.1017/S2045796013000097; 10.4088/JCP.v67n0317; 10.1177/2045125312474019; 10.1016/j.psychres.2009.05.004; 10.5897/JNBH2015.0128; 10.12816/0000100; 10.1007/s10597-014-9697-8; 10.1016/j.psychres.2007.07.027; 10.1007/s12571-017-0730-y; 10.1007/s44192-022-00018-x; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1994.tb01487.x; 10.1016/j.psychres.2014.01.043; 10.1017/S0033291700050182; 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2012.02.008; 10.1016/S0920-9964(99)00130-9; 10.1590/2237-6089-2017-0077; 10.2165/00115677-200311110-00002; 10.1017/S1092852900022045; 10.2174/1874941001104010058; 10.1001/jama.2013.281053; 10.1037/1082-989X.1.1.16; 10.1192/bjp.183.3.197; 10.1001/journalofethics.2015.17.11.stas1-1511; 10.4103/0022-3859.166514; 10.4103/0253-7176.135383; 10.1111/j.1440-1819.2007.01722.x; 10.4088/JCP.14m09669; 10.3310/hta20700; 10.1016/j.cegh.2013.11.001; 10.2174/1574886314666190301152734","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, Canada."
"36711661","Genetic liability to major psychiatric disorders contributes to multi-faceted quality of life outcomes in children and adults.","Yingjie Shi, Barbara Franke, Nina Roth Mota, Emma Sprooten","Psychiatric disorders can have an immense impact on socioeconomic, physical, and social-psychological facets of life. Psychiatric disorders are also highly heritable. Under a liability threshold model, an important question arises as to what extent genetic liability for psychiatric disorders relates to, and possibly impacts on, different aspects of quality of life in the general population. To characterize the link between psychiatric genetic liability and diverse aspects of quality of life in childhood and adulthood. We used data from two multi-site, population-based cohorts, i.e. preadolescent children in the USA enrolled at age 9-10 years from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (N=4,645) and white British adults between age 40-69 years from the UK Biobank (UKB) study (N=377,664). Due to the current limitations of our genetic methods, only data from unrelated individuals of European descent could be included. To derive robust measures capturing multiple domains of quality of life in each of the cohorts, we integrated an array of measurements of academic, economic, and physical status, as well as social well-being, in a second-level three-factor confirmatory factor analysis. The genetic liabilities to seven major psychiatric disorders were quantified by a set of polygenic scores (PGSs) derived from the largest genome-wide association studies to date, independent of the target cohorts, of major depressive disorder (MDD, N=142k-173k), anxiety disorders (ANX, N=22k-144k), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, N=226k), autism spectrum disorder (ASD, N=55k), schizophrenia (SCZ, N=130k), bipolar disorder (BIP, N=353k-414k), and cannabis use disorder (CUD, N=384k). Using general linear models we assessed associations between PGSs and the estimated latent factors, controlling for age, sex, site, genotyping batch, plate, and genetic ancestry. In each cohort, three latent factors indexing distinct but correlated quality of life domains, (1) educational performance and cognition (Edu, in ABCD) / social economic status (SES, in UKB), (2) physical health (Hea), (3) adverse social experience (Adv, in ABCD) / social well-being (Soc, in UKB), were estimated with excellent model fit indices. In addition, a general factor was derived that captured the covariances between the three latent factors (QoL). In the ABCD cohort, ADHD-PGS was significantly associated with Edu (&#x3b2; = -0.13, t = -8.29, p = 1.53e-16), Adv (&#x3b2; = -0.09, t = -5.79, p = 7.81e-09), and general QoL (&#x3b2; = -0.14, t = -8.74, p = 3.37e-18) factors. In the UKB cohort, all examined disorder PGSs were significantly associated with the general QoL latent factor and at least one first-order subdomain, with ADHD-PGS (&#x3b2; = -0.06 ~ -0.10, t = -29.1 ~ -52.5, p &lt; 5.91e-186) and MDD-PGS (&#x3b2; = -0.04 ~ -0.07, t = -23.8 ~ -36.3, p &lt; 3.63e-125) showing the largest effects. The present study reveals an inverse relationship between psychiatric genetic liabilities and multiple quality of life metrics, with ADHD-associated genetic risk being the main contributor in both children and adults, and MDD additionally showing effects in adults.

However, whether these risks are modified by a neighbourhood's socioeconomic profile is unclear. The aim of our study was to compare risks among disadvantaged young people residing in deprived areas versus risks among similarly disadvantaged individuals residing in affluent areas. We did a national cohort study, using Danish interlinked national registers, from which we delineated a longitudinal cohort of people born in Denmark between Jan 1, 1981, and Dec 31, 2001, with two Danish-born parents, who were alive and residing in the country when they were aged 15 years, who were followed up for a hospital-treated self-harm episode or violent crime conviction. A neighbourhood affluence indicator was derived based on nationwide income quartiles, with parental income and educational attainment indicating the socioeconomic position of each cohort member's family. Bayesian multilevel survival analyses were done to examine the moderating influences of neighbourhood affluence on associations between family socioeconomic position and sex-specific risks for the two adverse outcomes. 1&#x2008;084&#x2008;047 cohort members were followed up for 12&#xb7;8 million person-years in aggregate. Individuals of a low socioeconomic position residing in deprived neighbourhoods had a higher incidence of both self-harm and violent criminality compared with equivalently disadvantaged peers residing in affluent areas. Women from a low-income background residing in affluent areas had, on average, 95 (highest density interval 76-118) fewer self-harm episodes and 25 (15-41) fewer violent crime convictions per 10&#x2008;000 person-years compared with women of an equally low income residing in deprived areas, whereas men of a low income residing in affluent areas had 61 (39-81) fewer self-harm episodes and 88 (56-191) fewer violent crime convictions per 10&#x2008;000 person-years than men of a low income residing in deprived areas. Even in a high-income European country with comprehensive social welfare and low levels of poverty and inequality, individuals residing in affluent neighbourhoods have lower risks of self-harm and violent criminality compared with individuals residing in deprived neighbourhoods. More research is needed to explore the potential of neighbourhood policies and interventions to reduce the harmful effects of growing up in socioeconomically deprived circumstances on later risk of self-harm and violent crime convictions.

This study investigated the burden of disease attributable to amphetamine use disorder, cannabis use disorder (CAD), cocaine use disorder, and opioid use disorder (OUD) in South America from 1990 to 2019, on the basis of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019. GBD 2019 estimated the incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLL), years of life lived with disability (YLD), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to substance use disorders in each of the 12 South American countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela). Data were modelled using standardised tools (ie, the Cause of Death Ensemble model, spatio-temporal Gaussian process regression, and disease modelling meta-regression) to generate estimates of each quantity of interest by sex, location, and year. The analysis included comparisons by sex and country, and against regional and global estimates. In 2019, the highest amphetamine use disorder burden per 100&#x2008;000 population in South America was in Peru (66 DALYs). CAD DALY rates per 100&#x2008;000 in South America were stable between 1990 and 2019, except in Chile and Colombia, which had the highest rates in 2019 (19 DALYs for Chile and 18 DALYs for Colombia). OUD DALYs per 100&#x2008;000 increased during the period in Brazil and Peru, which in 2019 had the highest rates in South America (82 DALYs for Brazil and 70 DALYs for Peru). In 2019, Brazil had the highest cocaine use disorder DALYs per 100&#x2008;000 (45 DALYs), nearly double its rate in 1990. DALY rates were higher in males than females for each substance use disorder, except in Paraguay. The overall burden of substance use disorders was higher in males than in females, mainly because of cocaine use disorder and CAD, whereas for amphetamine use disorder, the difference between sexes was minimal, and for OUD there was no difference. For males and females, the highest rate of substance use disorders DALYs per 100&#x2008;000 was for OUD except in Argentina (in males, 58 DALYs for cocaine use disorder vs 52 DALYs for OUD) and in Paraguay (in females, 77 for amphetamine use disorder vs 50 for OUD). CAD DALY rates were generally the lowest among the substance use disorders for males and females. Amphetamine use disorder YLD rates were reasonably stable throughout the period and were highest in Peru, Paraguay, and Uruguay (&gt;40 YLD per 100&#x2008;000). For CAD, YLD rates were stable in all countries except Chile and Colombia. Cocaine use disorder YLD rates per 100&#x2008;000 for the top four countries (Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, and Brazil) increased from 1990 to 2010 (eg, from 19 to 33 in Brazil), but decreased between 2010 and 2019 (eg, from 36 to 31 in Chile). For OUD, YLD rates showed a slight increase in most countries apart from Brazil, which increased from 52 in 1990 to 80 in 2019 and was top among the countries. Amphetamine use disorder YLL rates per 100&#x2008;000 were highest in Suriname and Peru during the period, although in Suriname it increased from 2&#xb7;7 in 2010 to 3&#xb7;2 in 2019, whereas in Peru it decreased from 2&#xb7;1 to 1&#xb7;7. The highest YLL rate for cocaine use disorder was in Brazil, which increased from 3&#xb7;7 in 1990 to 18&#xb7;1 in 2019. Between 2000 and 2019, Chile and Uruguay showed the highest OUD YLL rates (11&#xb7;6 for Chile and 10&#xb7;9 for Uruguay). A high incidence of CAD was found in Chile, Colombia, Guyana, and Suriname. There were high incidences of amphetamine use disorder in Paraguay, cocaine use disorder in Argentina, and OUD in Ecuador. A decrease in annual prevalence for substance use disorders during the period was observed in Venezuela (amphetamine use disorder, CAD, and OUD), Brazil (CAD and amphetamine use disorder), Colombia (amphetamine use disorder and cocaine use disorder), Peru (amphetamine use disorder and cocaine use disorder), Chile and Suriname (amphetamine use disorder), Uruguay (CAD), and Bolivia (OUD). Overall, the cocaine use disorder burden stabilised then decreased. OUD was less prevalent than other substance use disorders but its burden was the highest. The decrease in the burden of cocaine use disorder probably reflects the success of national standardised treatment programmes. Programmes for amphetamine use disorder, CAD, and OUD management should be improved. We did not find an increase in CAD burden in Uruguay, the country with the highest degree of cannabis decriminalisation in the region. Countries in South America should improve monitoring of substance use disorders, including regular surveys to provide more accurate data on which to base policy decisions.

Governments and civil societies need population-based measures to monitor children's early development and ensure that children receive the care needed to thrive. To this end, the WHO developed the Global Scales for Early Development (GSED) to measure children's early development up to 3 years of age. The GSED includes three measures for population and programmatic level measurement: (1) short form (SF) (caregiver report), (2) long form (LF) (direct administration) and (3) psychosocial form (PF) (caregiver report). The primary aim of this protocol is to validate the GSED SF and LF. Secondary aims are to create preliminary reference scores for the GSED SF and LF, validate an adaptive testing algorithm and assess the feasibility and preliminary validity of the GSED PF. We will conduct the validation in seven countries (Bangladesh, Brazil, C&#xf4;te d'Ivoire, Pakistan, The Netherlands, People's Republic of China, United Republic of Tanzania), varying in geography, language, culture and income through a 1-year prospective design, combining cross-sectional and longitudinal methods with 1248 children per site, stratified by age and sex. The GSED generates an innovative common metric (Developmental Score: D-score) using the Rasch model and a Development for Age Z-score (DAZ). We will evaluate six psychometric properties of the GSED SF and LF: concurrent validity, predictive validity at 6&#x2009;months, convergent and discriminant validity, and test-retest and inter-rater reliability. We will evaluate measurement invariance by comparing differential item functioning and differential test functioning across sites. This study has received ethical approval from the WHO (protocol GSED validation 004583 20.04.2020) and approval in each site. Study results will be disseminated through webinars and publications from WHO, international organisations, academic journals and conference proceedings.

The aim was to study whether a potential association between indicators of SES and MS risk in Sweden is explained by lifestyle/environmental factors.

For all participants, information regarding ancestry, formal education (available 1990-2018) and family income (available 1998-2018) was retrieved from the National Board of Health and Welfare. The registry study revealed no association between education and MS risk, whereas an income exceeding the upper quartile was associated with lower MS risk compared to having an income in the lowest quartile (odds ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.82-0.90). These findings were replicated in the crude analyses of the case-control study. However, after adjustment for confounding, no association was observed between income and risk of MS. Education and income were not associated with occurrence of MS after adjustment for a few lifestyle-related factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index and sun exposure habits), indicating that SES has no influence on MS risk besides its association with these lifestyle factors in the Swedish context.",2023,4,1,"European journal of neurology","10.1111/ene.15705",NA,"Eur J Neurol","eng","D006801; D009103; D013548; D016022; D012923; D008019; D012042; D012959; D012307","Humans; Multiple Sclerosis; Sweden; Case-Control Studies; Social Class; Life Style; Registries; Socioeconomic Factors; Risk Factors",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."

However, the coordinated spatiotemporal arrangement of morphological features across development and their associations with behavior are unclear. Here, we examine covariation across multiple cortical features (cortical thickness [CT], surface area [SA], local gyrification index [GI], and mean curvature [MC]) using magnetic resonance images from the NIMH developmental cohort (ages 5-25). Neuroanatomical covariance was examined using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which decomposes covariance resulting in a parts-based representation. Cross-sectionally, we identified six components of covariation which demonstrate differential contributions of CT, GI, and SA in hetero- vs. unimodal areas. Using this technique to examine covariance in rates of change to identify longitudinal sources of covariance highlighted preserved SA in unimodal areas and changes in CT and GI in heteromodal areas. Using behavioral partial least squares (PLS), we identified a single latent variable (LV) that recapitulated patterns of reduced CT, GI, and SA related to older age, with limited contributions of IQ and SES. Longitudinally, PLS revealed three LVs that demonstrated a nuanced developmental pattern that highlighted a higher rate of maturational change in SA and CT in higher IQ and SES females. Finally, we situated the components in the changing architecture of cortical gradients.

The WHO led Global Scales for Early Development (GSED) project aims to provide population and programmatic level measures of ECD for 0-3&#x2009;years that are valid, reliable and have psychometrically stable performance across geographical, cultural and language contexts. This paper reports on the creation of two measures: (1) the GSED Short Form (GSED-SF)-a caregiver reported measure for population-evaluation-self-administered with no training required and (2) the GSED Long Form (GSED-LF)-a directly administered/observed measure for programmatic evaluation-administered by a trained professional. We selected 807 psychometrically best-performing items using a Rasch measurement model from an ECD measurement databank which comprised 66&#x2009;075 children assessed on 2211 items from 18 ECD measures in 32 countries. From 766 of these items, in-depth subject matter expert judgements were gathered to inform final item selection. Specifically collected were data on (1) conceptual matches between pairs of items originating from different measures, (2) developmental domain(s) measured by each item and (3) perceptions of feasibility of administration of each item in diverse contexts. Prototypes were finalised through a combination of psychometric performance evaluation and expert consensus to optimally identify items. We created the GSED-SF (139 items) and GSED-LF (157 items) for tablet-based and paper-based assessments, with an optimal set of items that fit the Rasch model, met subject matter expert criteria, avoided conceptual overlap, covered multiple domains of child development and were feasible to implement across diverse settings. State-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative procedures were used to select of theoretically relevant and globally feasible items representing child development for children aged 0-3 years.

"36607218","Associations between Socioeconomic Status, Cognition, and Brain Structure: Evaluating Potential Causal Pathways Through Mechanistic Models of Development.","Michael S C Thomas, Selma Coecke","Differences in socioeconomic status (SES) correlate both with differences in cognitive development and in brain structure. Associations between SES and brain measures such as cortical surface area and cortical thickness mediate differences in cognitive skills such as executive function and language. However, causal accounts that link SES, brain, and behavior are challenging because SES is a multidimensional construct: correlated environmental factors, such as family income and parental education, are only distal markers for proximal causal pathways. Moreover, the causal accounts themselves must span multiple levels of description, employ a developmental perspective, and integrate genetic effects on individual differences. Nevertheless, causal accounts have the potential to inform policy and guide interventions to reduce gaps in developmental outcomes. In this article, we review the range of empirical data to be integrated in causal accounts of developmental effects on the brain and cognition associated with variation in SES. We take the specific example of language development and evaluate the potential of a multiscale computational model of development, based on an artificial neural network, to support the construction of causal accounts. We show how, with bridging assumptions that link properties of network structure to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of brain structure, different sets of empirical data on SES effects can be connected. We use the model to contrast two possible causal pathways for environmental influences that are associated with SES: differences in prenatal brain development and differences in postnatal cognitive stimulation. We then use the model to explore the implications of each pathway for the potential to intervene to reduce gaps in developmental outcomes. The model points to the cumulative effects of social disadvantage on multiple pathways as the source of the poorest response to interventions. Overall, we highlight the importance of implemented models to test competing accounts of environmental influences on individual differences.",2023,1,1,"Cognitive science","10.1111/cogs.13217",NA,"Cogn Sci","eng","D005260; D011247; D006801; D001921; D003071; D012923; D007802; D008279","Female; Pregnancy; Humans; Brain; Cognition; Social Class; Language; Magnetic Resonance Imaging","MR/R00322X/1","NA",NA,"Quantinuum."

We collected data from perinatal women at two time-points during the COVID-19 pandemic to test the hypotheses that (1) socio-economic adversities at baseline would be associated with CMD prevalence at follow-up and (2) worse mental health at baseline would be associated with higher food insecurity prevalence at follow-up. Telephonic interviews with perinatal women attending healthcare facilities in Cape Town, South Africa. Multivariable (multilevel) regression analysis was used to model the associations of baseline risk factors with the prevalence of household food insecurity and probable CMD at 3 months follow-up. At baseline 859 women were recruited, of whom 217 (25%) were pregnant, 631 (73%) had given birth in the previous 6 months, 106 (12%) had probable CMD, and 375 (44%) were severely food insecure. At follow-up (<i>n</i> = 634), 22 (4%) were still pregnant, 603 (95%) had given birth, 44 (7%) had probable CMD, and 207 (33%) were severely food insecure.

Detection of A&#x3b2; pathology is essential for AD diagnosis and for identifying and recruiting research participants for clinical trials evaluating disease-modifying therapies. Currently, AD diagnoses are usually made by clinical assessments, although detection of AD pathology with positron emission tomography (PET) scans or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis can be used by specialty clinics. These measures of A&#x3b2;&#xa0;aggregation, e.g. plaques, protofibrils, and oligomers, are medically invasive and often only available at specialized medical centers or not covered by medical insurance, and PET scans are costly. Therefore, a major goal in recent years has been to identify blood-based biomarkers that can accurately detect AD pathology with cost-effective, minimally invasive procedures.To assess the performance of plasma A&#x3b2; assays in predicting amyloid burden in the central nervous system (CNS), this review compares twenty-one different manuscripts that used measurements of 42 and 40 amino acid-long A&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;42 and A&#x3b2;40) in plasma to predict CNS amyloid status. Methodologies that quantitate A&#x3b2;42 and 40 peptides in blood via immunoassay or immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) were considered, and their ability to distinguish participants with amyloidosis compared to amyloid PET and CSF A&#x3b2; measures as reference standards was evaluated.

"36553351","Development of a German Physical Literacy Assessment for Children in the Context of Health Promotion-An Explorative Approach.","Leonie Krenz, Martin Grauduszus, Marlen Klaudius, Isabel Stolz, Stefanie Wessely, Christine Joisten","Addressing physical literacy (PL) has become increasingly relevant to counteract sedentary behaviour in children and youth. We developed an assessment tool to measure and evaluate the promotion of individual PL and its four subdomains: motivation and confidence (the affective dimension), physical competence (physical dimension), knowledge and understanding (cognitive dimension), and participation in physical activity. Within this cross-sectional study, we tested 567 children aged 6&#x2212;12 years from four primary schools that differed in socioeconomic status (SES). A subsequent exploratory factor analysis conducted to examine the conformity revealed a five-factor structure. The five factors explained 39.8% of the total cumulative variance. Children with a low SES yielded lower scores in all subdomains except participation in physical activity. This effect was most pronounced in motor skills (p &lt; 0.001, r = 0.28). Among the children with a low SES, 16.9% were overweight and 17.4% were obese, compared to 11.5% and 5.4%, respectively, for those with a high SES (p &lt; 0.001).

However, it is unclear to what extent their contributions are unique and if they interact. Here we used a multi-trait polygenic score for cognition (cogPGS) with a quasi-experimental regression discontinuity design to isolate how months of schooling relate to intelligence in 6567 children (aged 9-11). We found large, independent effects of schooling (&#x3b2; ~&#x2009;0.15), cogPGS (&#x3b2; ~&#x2009;0.10), and SES (&#x3b2; ~&#x2009;0.20) on working memory, crystallized (cIQ), and fluid intelligence (fIQ). Notably, two years of schooling had a larger effect on intelligence than the lifetime consequences, since birth, of SES or cogPGS-based inequalities. However, schooling showed no interaction with cogPGS or SES for the three intelligence domains tested. While schooling had strong main effects on intelligence, it did not lessen, nor widen the impact of these preexisting SES or genetic factors.",2022,12,15,"NPJ science of learning","10.1038/s41539-022-00148-5","PMC9755250","NPJ Sci Learn","eng",NA,NA,"2019-01768_3; 2019-01768_3; 2019-01768_3","10.1136/bmj.j2708; 10.1097/EDE.0b013e31818ba076; 10.1016/j.intell.2006.02.001; 10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00687.x; 10.1037/0033-2909.101.2.171; 10.1037/0033-2909.131.2.301; 10.1038/ng.3285; 10.1038/mp.2011.85; 10.1080/03014460903103939; 10.1038/mp.2009.55; 10.1177/0956797618774253; 10.1037/0012-1649.27.5.703; 10.1093/ije/dys148; 10.1073/pnas.1106077109; 10.1080/03054980600776589; 10.2307/1130797; 10.1037/h0026997; 10.1097/DBP.0000000000000121; 10.1016/j.intell.2009.09.001; 10.1016/j.lindif.2013.01.015; 10.1016/j.intell.2014.10.002; 10.1111/desc.12925; 10.1038/s41539-020-00079-z; 10.1038/s41539-018-0019-8; 10.1016/j.intell.2013.11.002; 10.1038/s41588-018-0147-3; 10.1038/s41562-019-0757-5; 10.1073/pnas.2001228117; 10.1037/bul0000131; 10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.346; 10.1177/0963721413485087; 10.1037/0033-295X.101.4.568; 10.15195/v5.a22; 10.1016/j.econedurev.2017.10.001; 10.15195/v2.a6; 10.1038/s41588-020-00754-2; 10.1073/pnas.1601135113; 10.1080/87565640801982312; 10.1016/j.tics.2010.05.002; 10.1038/s41539-021-00096-6; 10.1016/j.dcn.2018.04.004; 10.1016/j.intell.2006.09.004; 10.1016/j.ajhg.2019.06.006; 10.1080/19485565.2019.1681257; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.09.006; 10.3102/0013189X20912798; 10.1037/0033-2909.97.1.129; 10.1080/00031305.2018.1549101; 10.1371/journal.pgen.1009021; 10.1016/j.dcn.2022.101078; 10.1111/jopy.12227; 10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.07.014; 10.1073/pnas.1708491114; 10.1038/s41539-019-0052-2; 10.1371/journal.pgen.1009153; 10.1177/0038040716651676; 10.1177/2515245919847202; 10.1093/aje/kwx246; 10.15195/v7.a19; 10.1038/s41562-021-01119-3; 10.1038/s41562-021-01110-y; 10.1016/j.dcn.2018.02.006; 10.1017/S1355617714000241; 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182872e5f; 10.7326/M13-2946; 10.1186/s12864-016-2495-7; 10.1038/nature11632; 10.1038/s41588-017-0009-4; 10.18637/jss.v067.i01; 10.1177/00031224211004187; 10.1080/13803611003694391; 10.1371/journal.pone.0030320; 10.1037/0033-2909.84.2.309; 10.18637/jss.v048.i02; 10.18637/jss.v080.i01","The authors declare no competing interests.","Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden."
"36518826","Psychological Patient-reported Outcomes Cannot Predict a Second Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury in Patients who Return to Sports after an Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.","Ramana Piussi, Rebecca Simonson, Johan H&#xf6;gberg, Roland Thome&#xe9;, Kristian Samuelsson, Eric Hamrin Senorski","Psychological patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are recommended for use in test batteries to aid in decision-making, regarding whether patients are well prepared to return to sports (RTS) after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. However, the values that should be regarded as ""pass"" or ""fail"" are still unclear. This study aimed to identify cut-off values for three commonly used psychological PROs that could differentiate patients who suffer a second ACL injury from patients who do not within two years of RTS in patients after ACL reconstruction with respect to recovery of symmetrical quadriceps strength. Diagnostic/prognostic study. Demographic data, isokinetic strength test data for quadriceps, as well as results for the ACL-Return to Sport after Injury scale (ACL-RSI), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Quality of Life, and Function in Sport and Recreation sub-scales, and the 18-item version of the Knee Self-Efficacy Scale (K-SES<sub>18</sub>) were extracted from a registry. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated for each PRO. Accuracy of the cut-offs was presented with two summary measures for the ROC: the area under the curve (AUC) and Youden index. In total, 641 (355 men, 61%) patients (24.8 [SD 7.6] year old at ACL reconstruction) were included. The cut-off values were not able to differentiate patients who suffered a second ACL injury up to 24 months after RTS and ACL reconstruction from patients who did not. Additionally, achieving symmetrical quadriceps strength did not improve the cut-off psychometric properties. Since cut-off values could not differentiate between patients who suffered a second ACL injury and those who did not, clinicians should not rely only on cut-off values or a single PRO of those analyzed in this study when making decisions on which patients are at risk of experiencing a second ACL injury when returning to sports after ACL reconstruction.

"36461030","Compensation of overall physical activity in (pre)adolescent girls - the CReActivity project.","Franziska Beck, Ulrich Dettweiler, David Joseph Sturm, Yolanda Demetriou, Anne Kerstin Reimers","According to the ActivityStat hypothesis more physical activity (PA) in one timespan is compensated by increased sedentary time (ST) in the following timespan and vice versa to maintain an overall stable PA level. Until now, existing literature revealed inconsistent results regarding compensatory behaviour across children and adolescents. Thus, the aim of the present study is (1) to investigate whether ST in the morning is compensated by active behaviour in the afternoon and (2) whether ST during the week is compensated by active behaviour during the weekend in (pre)adolescent girls. Additionally, we aimed to differentiate between positive and negative compensatory behaviour and examine whether it is moderated by socioeconomic status (SES), age or weight status. The participants were 370 sixth grade school girls (mean age 11.6&#xa0;years) from Munich that participated in the CReActivity study, a school based intervention study aiming to identify the mechanisms of behavioural changes in PA among girls. ST and PA were measured over seven consecutive days using accelerometery. Descriptive determination of compensatory behaviour, as well as Bayesian multivariate multilevel analysis were conducted with data clustered on the individual (ID), class and school level. Descriptive analysis revealed rather constant compensatory behaviour of about 60% for after-school days and weekends over all observation points. However, regarding all girls, compensation was predominantly negative. Differentiated analysis indicated that all girls with low ST levels in the morning or on weekdays, compensated for this behaviour with lower PA levels in the afternoon or on weekends. Multilevel covariate analysis indicated great variability between the participants. Furthermore, differences in compensatory behaviour can also be seen on class and school levels. Interestingly, PA compensatory behaviour is not associated with age, weight status or SES. Our findings could neither confirm nor reject the ActivityStat Hypothesis. Overall, due to the great variability across the girls, it seems that compensation depends on individual factors. In the future, to prevent negative compensation, school-based interventions that have the potential to provide opportunities to be physically active, should not neglect (pre)adolescents' leisure time behaviour.

Results show a significant relation between behavioral strengths and difficulties and age with parents rating increasingly more difficulties (slightly higher, higher and very high) from 5&#x2009;years (11.1%) to 9&#x2009;years (30.8%) and 11&#x2009;years (78.9%) of age and then fewer difficulties at 14&#x2009;years (50%) of age. Working Memory Index (WMI) explained significant variance in SDQ-Total-Score (17.5%) and SDQ-Impact-Score (11.2%). WMI together with upper motor function explained 19.5% variance in SDQ-Hyperactivity and 19.7% in SDQ-Peer-Problems. Age and SES explained an 18.9% variance in SDQ-Emotional-Problems. Age is an important factor when analyzing behavioral strengths and difficulties for boys with DMD. The development of boys with DMD needs to be understood in the context of expected developmental trajectory as well as in the decline of psychical functioning. Our study supports that age, cognition, motor function, and family SES all contribute to how behavioral strengths and difficulties evolves in boys with DMD.",2023,8,1,"Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence","10.1080/09297049.2022.2144814",NA,"Child Neuropsychol","eng","D008297; D006801; D002648; D002675; D020388; D013548; D003430; D002653; D003071","Male; Humans; Child; Child, Preschool; Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne; Sweden; Cross-Sectional Studies; Child Behavior Disorders; Cognition",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Psychology, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden."

The objective was to examine mortality due to multiple sclerosis according to socio-economic status. A retrospective observational cohort design was used with recruitment from 18 French multiple sclerosis expert centers participating in the <i>Observatoire Fran&#xe7;ais de la Scl&#xe9;rose en Plaques.</i> All patients lived in metropolitan France and had a definite or probable diagnosis of multiple sclerosis according to either Poser or McDonald criteria with an onset of disease between 1960 and 2015. Initial phenotype was either relapsing-onset or primary progressive onset. Vital status was updated on January 1st 2016. Socio-economic status was measured by an ecological index, the European Deprivation Index and was attributed to each patient according to their home address. Excess death rates were studied according to socio-economic status using additive excess hazard models with multidimensional penalised splines. The initial hypothesis was a potential socio-economic gradient in excess mortality. A total of 34,169 multiple sclerosis patients were included (88% relapsing onset (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;30,083), 12% progressive onset (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;4086)), female/male sex ratio 2.7 for relapsing-onset and 1.3 for progressive-onset). Mean age at disease onset was 31.6 (SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;9.8) for relapsing-onset and 42.7 (SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;10.8) for progressive-onset. At the end of follow-up, 1849 patients had died (4.4% for relapsing-onset (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;1311) and 13.2% for progressive-onset (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;538)). A socio-economic gradient was found for relapsing-onset patients; more deprived patients had a greater excess death rate. At thirty years of disease duration and a year of onset of symptoms of 1980, survival probability difference (or deprivation gap) between less deprived relapsing-onset patients (EDI&#xa0;=&#xa0;-6) and more deprived relapsing-onset patients (EDI&#xa0;=&#xa0;12) was 16.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) [10.3%-22.9%]) for men and 12.3% (95%CI [7.6%-17.0%]) for women. No clear socio-economic mortality gradient was found in progressive-onset patients. Socio-economic status was associated with mortality due to multiple sclerosis in relapsing-onset patients. Improvements in overall care of more socio-economically deprived patients with multiple sclerosis could help reduce these socio-economic inequalities in multiple sclerosis-related mortality.

"36416481","Ahead of the pain: Where we stand after a decade of growth in United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties-certified headache subspecialists.","Skyler L Kanegi, Noah L Rosen","To characterize the geographic distribution of United States (US) headache subspecialists in 2021 compared to 2012 and analyze trends in distribution of and growth by geography. Headache disorders are the second-highest cause of disease burden worldwide. Historically, headache disorders have been treated by primary care and emergency physicians, often suboptimally. Our 2012 study identified further disparities in geographic distribution of United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties (UCNS)-certified headache subspecialists. This correlational population study explores the current geographic distribution of and changes in subspecialists by aggregating data from the UCNS, National Health Interview Survey, US Census, Bureau of Economic Analysis, and American Community Survey. In 2021, there were 692 UCNS-certified headache subspecialists. There continued to be higher subspecialist density in the Northeast (1:34,678) and Midwest (1:55,005), with the highest density in Vermont (1:12,510) and Connecticut (1:20,419). The highest absolute subspecialist increases were in the South (99), California (35), and Texas (25). The highest relative subspecialist increases were in the West (105%), Vermont (500%), and Mississippi (500%). The univariable regressions showed significant associations between number of subspecialists and adult headache population (R<sup>2</sup> &#xa0;=&#xa0;0.797, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), between subspecialist density and personal income (R<sup>2</sup> &#xa0;=&#xa0;0.935, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.033), and between growth in subspecialists and poverty rate (R<sup>2</sup> &#xa0;=&#xa0;0.553, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.022). However, the multivariable regressions showed that only the adult population was significantly associated with number of subspecialists (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> &#xa0;=&#xa0;0.806, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Overall, there has been substantial growth in the number of UCNS-certified headache subspecialists in the US, especially relative to growth in adult headache population. Subspecialist density continues to be highest in the Northeast and is associated with higher per capita personal income. However, there has been encouraging growth in geographies that previously had little to no access. These findings represent positive progress, but there is more to be done to both increase access to optimal headache care by subspecialists nationally and decrease geographic disparities in access to care.",2022,11,1,"Headache","10.1111/head.14425",NA,"Headache","eng","D000328; D014481; D006801; D006261; D002568; D020773; D013781","Adult; United States; Humans; Headache; Certification; Headache Disorders; Texas",NA,"NA",NA,"Northwell Health Neuroscience Institute/Zucker School of Medicine, Hofstra University, Great Neck, New York, USA."
"36413871","Relationships among age, socioeconomic status, and distractibility in preschoolers as assessed by the Competitive Attention Test.","Roxane S Hoyer, Eric Pakulak, Aur&#xe9;lie Bidet-Caulet, Christina M Karns","In children, the ability to attend to relevant auditory information and ignore distracting information is crucial for learning and educational achievement. Distractibility, the propensity to pay attention to irrelevant information, depends on multiple components of cognition (voluntary attention orienting, sustained attention, distraction resulting from the capture of attention by a distractor, phasic arousal, impulsivity, and motor control) that may mature at different ages. Here, we used the Competitive Attention Test (CAT) to measure these components in children aged 3 to 5&#xa0;years. Our goal was to characterize changes in the efficiency of attention during the preschool period and to determine whether distractibility varies as a function of socioeconomic status (SES). All 3-year-olds (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;14) and some 4- and 5-year-olds (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;21) needed to be excluded from the sample due to noncompliance with instructions, suggesting that the CAT might not be suitable for children with poorly developed skills in sustained attention. Among 4- and 5-year-olds who completed the CAT (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;71), sustained attention improved with age, whereas voluntary attention orienting remained immature. Independent of age, task-irrelevant sounds induced distraction, phasic arousal, and impulsivity. There was no relationship between SES and children's distraction. Finally, children from lower SES backgrounds showed reduced sustained attention abilities and increased impulsivity. Taken together, these findings suggest that distractibility is still developing during the preschool period and is likely to vary depending on the SES background of a child's family.",2023,3,1,"Journal of experimental child psychology","10.1016/j.jecp.2022.105584",NA,"J Exp Child Psychol","eng","D002675; D006801; D012923; D000161; D013016; D007858; D003071","Child, Preschool; Humans; Social Class; Acoustic Stimulation; Sound; Learning; Cognition",NA,"NA",NA,"Center on Brain Injury Research and Training, Department of Psychology, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403, USA."
"36397946","Premature Dropout From Psychotherapy: Prevalence, Perceived Reasons and Consequences as Rated by Clinicians.","Niclas Kullgard, Rolf Holmqvist, Gerhard Andersson","Why clients discontinue their psychotherapies has attracted more attention recently as it is a major problem for many healthcare services. Studies suggest that dropout rates may be affected by the mode of therapy, low-quality therapeutic alliance, low SES, and by conditions such personality disorders or substance abuse. The aims of the study were to investigate what happens in therapies which end in a dropout, and to estimate how common dropout is as reported by practicing clinicians. An online questionnaire was developed and completed by 116 therapists working in clinical settings. They were recruited via social media (Facebook and different online psychotherapy groups) in Sweden and worked with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Psychodynamic Therapy (PDT), Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) and Integrative Psychotherapy (IP). Psychotherapists rated the frequency of premature dropout in psychotherapy to be on average 8.89% (MD = 5, SD = 8.34, Range = 0-50%). The most common reasons for a dropout, as stated by the therapists, were that clients were not satisfied with the type of intervention offered, or that clients did not benefit from the treatment as they had expected. The most common feeling following a dropout was self-doubt. In conclusion, premature dropout is common in clinical practice and has negative emotional consequences for therapists. Premature dropout may lead to feelings of self-doubt and powerlessness among therapists. The therapeutic alliance was mostly rated as good in dropout therapies. Further research is needed to validate the findings with data on the prevalence and subjective reasons behind a dropout from point of view of clients.",2022,6,1,"Clinical psychology in Europe","10.32872/cpe.6695","PMC9667417","Clin Psychol Eur","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1037/0033-3204.45.2.247; 10.1007/s10488-011-0398-0; 10.1002/erv.911; 10.1348/014466503321903553; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2015.06.005; 10.1037/a0013075; 10.1037/pst0000185; 10.1037/pst0000172; 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.1.102803.143810; 10.1037/1040-3590.12.1.19; 10.1080/10503307.2016.1246765; 10.1037/0033-3204.40.3.226; 10.1037/pst0000189; 10.1037/a0022182; 10.17744/mehc.25.2.xhyreggxdcd0q4ny; 10.1080/10503307.2010.534509; 10.1037/0022-0167.34.1.80; 10.1080/10503300601032506; 10.1037/0033-3204.38.4.357; 10.1080/09515071003721552; 10.1080/10503307.2016.1174345; 10.1177/1073191116632336; 10.1002/cpp.1977; 10.1080/10673220590956429; 10.1111/j.1939-0025.1983.tb03394.x; 10.1002/1097-4679(199205)48:3&lt;379::AID-JCLP2270480317&gt;3.0.CO;2-P; 10.1080/10503307.2011.573819; 10.1037/a0022140; 10.1080/00107530.2014.880318; 10.1037/0003-066X.50.12.965; 10.1037/a0021175; 10.1037/0022-006X.75.1.104; 10.1037/a0017003; 10.1037/a0028226; 10.1037/a0037512; 10.1037/0735-7028.24.2.190; 10.1037/0022-006X.74.1.130","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Department of Behavioural Sciences and Learning, Link&#xf6;ping University, Link&#xf6;ping, Sweden."

Lack of in-person schooling and increased stress can affect neurodevelopment, mental health, and later life outcomes, especially for students who are from low socioeconomic status (SES) households. Insights from neuroscience on child development reveal potential neural mechanisms and educational outcomes likely disrupted by the pandemic-and how this will disproportionally affect low-SES children. Three policies can combat these educational and emotional effects: increased access to online resources, investments in social-emotional health, and increased access to summer/out-of-school learning. Integrating the traditionally separate fields of neuroscience and educational research will be critical for developing and assessing the most impactful policies to improve the well-being and educational achievement of our most disadvantaged children.",2021,10,1,"Policy insights from the behavioral and brain sciences","10.1177/23727322211032248","PMC9648494","Policy Insights Behav Brain Sci","eng",NA,NA,"R01 MH115910; R01 MH117141","10.1523/JNEUROSCI.19-23-10530.1999; 10.3102/01623737023002171; 10.1111/josh.12753; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01019.x; 10.1037/a0019672; 10.1177/1099800418779214; 10.1146/annurev.psych.58.110405.085551; 10.1111/j.1746-1561.2010.00562.x; 10.1111/1467-8624.00469; 10.1016/j.neuron.2017.08.034; 10.1186/s13034-020-00329-3; 10.1177/0093854809353051; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2019.104691; 10.1073/pnas.0402680101; 10.1177/2333794X17744950; 10.1016/S0022-4405(02)00108-5; 10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.003; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.1475; 10.1007/S10802-012-9629-4; 10.3389/fnsys.2015.00170; 10.1016/j.cbpra.2020.06.001; 10.1002/mhw.32238; 10.1073/pnas.1308240110; 10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00154; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2004.11.009; 10.3102/0013189X20965918; 10.1016/S2352-4642(20)30109-7; 10.1101/lm.703907; 10.1006/cogp.1999.0734; 10.1002/hipo.22797; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2012.01147.x; 10.1038/nrn2317; 10.1111/psyp.13025; 10.1016/j.cub.2013.05.041; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.03.006; 10.1177/0272431617725198; 10.2217/epi.12.58; 10.1017/S0954579417001390; 10.1371/journal.pone.0035744; 10.1001/jama.2009.754; 10.1126/science.2704997; 10.1016/j.neuron.2009.06.024; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.01.025; 10.1080/23761407.2016.1166855; 10.1007/s00787-020-01541-4","Declaration of Conflicting Interests The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.","University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA."

We tested the effectiveness of a behavioral intervention using soccer training to reduce the cluster of risks associated with HIV and substance use. This cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted with men aged 18-29&#xa0;years old in 27 neighborhoods in the townships of Cape Town, South Africa. Neighborhoods were randomized to receive for 6&#xa0;months either: (1) Soccer League (SL; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;18 neighborhoods, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;778 men) who attended soccer three times weekly (72 sessions; 94% uptake, 45.5% weekly attendance rate), combined with an HIV/substance use, cognitive-behavioral intervention; or (2) a Control Condition (CC; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;9; 415 men) who received educational materials and referrals at 3&#xa0;month intervals. The primary outcome was the number of significant changes in a cluster of outcomes including HIV-related risks, substance abuse, employment/income, mental health, violence, and community engagement. There was only one significant difference on the rapid diagnostic tests for mandrax at 6&#xa0;months, an insufficient number of changes to indicate a successful intervention. A group-based behavioral intervention was ineffective in addressing multiple risk behaviors among at-risk young men, similar to the findings of several recent soccer-related interventions. Early adulthood may be too late to alter well-established patterns of risk behaviors.Clinical Trial Registration This trial was prospectively registered on 24 November 2014 with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02358226.",2023,3,1,"AIDS and behavior","10.1007/s10461-022-03819-x","PMC9944297","AIDS Behav","eng","D000293; D000328; D006801; D008297; D055815; D044383; D015658; D012916; D013019; D019966; D006293","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Young Adult; Black People; HIV Infections; Soccer; South Africa; Substance-Related Disorders; Health Promotion","R01DA038675; UL1 TR001881; R24AA022919","10.3109/10826081003767635; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.08.021; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2013.03.004; 10.1007/s10461-015-1262-0; 10.1521/aeap.2019.31.3.224; 10.1057/dev.2008.75; 10.1097/OLQ.0b013e3181e77cdd; 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60948-X; 10.15288/jsa.2005.66.91; 10.1057/jphp.2011.35; 10.1007/s10912-015-9369-x; 10.1016/S2352-3018(18)30327-8; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001167; 10.1037/a0032711; 10.1177/1557988319856739; 10.1186/s13063-018-2804-3; 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2006.00451.x; 10.1177/0020872808099726; 10.1177/0193723508328904; 10.1080/15374416.2013.836453; 10.1037/a0028180; 10.1007/s11121-017-0787-z; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.12.042; 10.1080/00952990.2018.1456545; 10.1177/014662167700100306; 10.1007/s11121-016-0676-x; 10.2307/2136404; 10.1186/1471-2458-14-316; 10.3109/10826084.2010.481594; 10.1177/003335491112600603; 10.1097/QAI.0b013e3181fbcb38; 10.1037/0003-066X.54.9.755; 10.1080/09595230801919494; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.08.003; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2006.01777.x; 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2010.03639.x; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1003056; 10.1007/s11121-013-0455-x; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2009.05.007; 10.1097/QAD.0b013e3283601b53; 10.2196/10759; 10.1007/s10461-014-0694-2; 10.1037/a0034200; 10.3389/fpsyt.2011.00082; 10.1007/s10461-012-0348-1; 10.1080/17430437.2014.997586; 10.1007/s10461-013-0448-6; 10.1080/09540121003758606; 10.1080/15381501.2019.1620663; 10.1136/sextrans-2013-051184.0833; 10.1097/QAI.0000000000001046","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Department of Psychiatry &amp; Biobehavioral Sciences, Semel Institute, University of California Los Angeles, 10920 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 350, Los Angeles, CA, 90024, USA."
"36377042","The relationship between perceived income inequality, adverse mental health and interpersonal difficulties in UK adolescents.","Blanca Piera Pi-Sunyer, Jack L Andrews, Amy Orben, Lydia G Speyer, Sarah-Jayne Blakemore","Adolescence is a period of life when young people increasingly define themselves through peer comparison and are vulnerable to developing mental health problems. In the current study, we investigated whether the subjective experience of economic disadvantage among friends is associated with social difficulties and poorer mental health in early adolescence. We used latent change score modelling (LCSM) on data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, collected at ages 11 and 14 (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;12,995). Each LCSM modelled the mean of an outcome related to mental health and interpersonal difficulties at age 11 (including self-esteem, well-being, emotional difficulties, peer problems, bullying, victimisation and externalising difficulties), the change of the outcome from ages 11 to 14 and its predictors, including perceived income inequality among friends (i.e. perceiving oneself as belonging to a poorer family than the families of one's friends). Perceived income inequality predicted adverse mental health and a range of interpersonal difficulties during adolescence, even when controlling for objective family income. Follow-up analyses highlighted that, at 11&#x2009;years, young people who perceived themselves as belonging to poorer families than their friends reported worse well-being, self-esteem, internalising problems, externalising problems and victimisation at the same age (relative to those who perceived themselves as richer than or equal to their friends, or who did not know). Longitudinal analyses suggested that victimisation decreased from ages 11 to 14 to a greater extent for adolescents who perceived themselves as poorer than other adolescents. The salience of economic inequalities in proximal social environments (e.g. among friends) in early adolescence could further amplify the negative effects of economic disadvantage on mental health and behavioural difficulties during this period.",2023,3,1,"Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","10.1111/jcpp.13719","PMC10100326","J Child Psychol Psychiatry","eng","D006801; D000293; D002648; D008603; D015331; D001523; D007182; D006113","Humans; Adolescent; Child; Mental Health; Cohort Studies; Mental Disorders; Income; United Kingdom","WT107496/ Z/15/Z; MC_UU_00030/13; SWAG/076.G101400","10.1007/s12144-021-02232-2",NA,"Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."

Findings from the AusDiab study.","Ester Cerin, Anthony Barnett, Yu-Tzu Wu, Erika Martino, Jonathan E Shaw, Luke D Knibbs, Govinda Poudel, Bin Jalaludin, Kaarin J Anstey","Characteristics of the neighbourhood environment, including the built and natural environment, area-level socio-economic status (SES) and air pollution, have been linked to cognitive health. However, most studies have focused on single neighbourhood characteristics and have not considered the extent to which the effects of environmental factors may interact. We examined the associations of measures of the neighbourhood built and natural environment, area-level SES and traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) with two cognitive function domains (memory and processing speed), and the extent to which area-level SES and TRAP moderated the associations. We used cross-sectional data from the AusDiab3 study, an Australian cohort study of adults (mean age: 61 years) in 2011-12 (N = 4141) for which geocoded residential addresses were available. Spatial data were used to create composite indices of built environment complexity (population density, intersection density, non-commercial land use mix, commercial land use) and natural environment (parkland and blue spaces). Area-level SES was obtained from national census indices and TRAP was based on estimates of annual average levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>). Confounder-adjusted generalised additive mixed models were used to estimate the independent associations of the environmental measures with cognitive function and the moderating effects of area-level SES and TRAP. The positive associations between built environment complexity and memory were stronger in those living in areas with higher SES and lower NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. A positive association between the natural environment and memory was found only in those living in areas with lower NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and average or below-average SES. Built environment complexity and the natural environment were positively related to processing speed. Complex urban environments and access to nature may benefit cognitive health in ageing populations. For higher-order cognitive abilities, such as memory, these positive effects may be stronger in areas with lower levels of TRAP.",2023,2,1,"The Science of the total environment","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160028",NA,"Sci Total Environ","eng","D006801; D008875; D015331; D003430; D000078022; D001315; D003071; D000397","Humans; Middle Aged; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Economic Status; Australia; Cognition; Air Pollution","MR/T038500/1","NA","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.","School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, Randwick, NSW, Australia; Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), Sydney, Australia; UNSW Ageing Futures Institute, Sydney, Australia."
"36360960","Child Welfare Reform: A Scoping Review.","Jill R McTavish, Christine McKee, Masako Tanaka, Harriet L MacMillan","While there have been ongoing calls to reform child welfare so that it better meets children's and families' needs, to date there have been no comprehensive summaries of child welfare reform strategies. For this systematic scoping review, we summarized authors' recommendations for improving child welfare. We conducted a systematic search (2010 to 2021) and included published reviews that addressed authors' recommendations for improving child welfare for children, youth, and families coming into contact with child welfare in high-income countries. A total of 4758 records was identified by the systematic search, 685 full-text articles were screened for eligibility, and 433 reviews were found to be eligible for this scoping review. Reviews were theoretically divided, with some review authors recommending reform efforts at the macro level (e.g., addressing poverty) and others recommending reform efforts at the practice level (e.g., implementing evidence-based parenting programs). Reform efforts across socioecological levels were summarized in this scoping review. An important next step is to formulate what policy solutions are likely to lead to the greatest improvement in safety and well-being for children and families involved in child welfare.",2022,10,28,"International journal of environmental research and public health","10.3390/ijerph192114071","PMC9655914","Int J Environ Res Public Health","eng","D002648; D000293; D006801; D002669; D004608; D011203; D007182; D008137","Child; Adolescent; Humans; Child Welfare; Eligibility Determination; Poverty; Income; Longitudinal Studies",NA,"10.1080/09540261.2016.1205001; 10.1258/jrsm.2011.110222; 10.1037/a0024768; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.192; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001349; 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2014.10.017; 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61707-9; 10.2105/AJPH.2017.304258; 10.2105/AJPH.2016.303545; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2019.104191; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2005.02.009; 10.1177/0025802414543855; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2009.01372.x; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2017.06.004; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2017.02.035; 10.1177/1524838017726427; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2015.09.018; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.05.001; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2016.11.028; 10.1086/644381; 10.2307/1602630; 10.1016/j.psi.2015.10.003; 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2018.03.021; 10.1080/13548506.2016.1271952; 10.1177/15248380211013131; 10.2471/BLT.08.057075; 10.1177/1524838014566718; 10.1186/s12889-015-2387-9; 10.1111/j.1468-0009.2011.00655.x; 10.1093/her/cyu012; 10.4073/csr.2015.10; 10.1007/s10567-017-0250-5; 10.1186/1471-2288-13-48; 10.1097/XEB.0000000000000050; 10.1093/humupd/dmh058; 10.4103/2249-4863.109934; 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2005.03621.x; 10.1186/s12916-015-0465-6; 10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00269; 10.1111/j.1471-1842.2009.00848.x; 10.1080/0312407X.2011.574145; 10.1080/15548732.2011.617272; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2019.03.012; 10.1007/s10826-011-9454-3; 10.1177/1049731515620843; 10.1007/s10560-012-0272-2; 10.1007/s11414-015-9480-9; 10.1007/s10560-019-00598-8; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2012.01.023; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2016.02.023; 10.1111/cfs.12832; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.104995; 10.1007/s10560-014-0346-4; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.08.017; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105260; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104762; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2013.10.008; 10.1007/s10560-020-00722-z; 10.1002/car.2607; 10.1177/15248380211013129; 10.1111/fcre.12222; 10.1080/15548732.2020.1814541; 10.1080/10522158.2019.1635938; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2013.11.013; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105714; 10.1177/0002716220980329; 10.1177/1524838019881707; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.08.016; 10.1080/10911359.2018.1466751; 10.1093/sw/swz029; 10.1177/0020872819897757; 10.1080/01612840.2018.1479902; 10.1016/j.cppeds.2015.08.004; 10.1606/1044-3894.4040; 10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2009.06.018; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105005; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104632; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2012.12.009; 10.1038/pr.2015.196; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2012.03.021; 10.1606/1044-3894.2015.96.22; 10.1080/15548732.2017.1355866; 10.1016/j.chc.2019.02.001; 10.1080/15548732.2018.1512933; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2014.02.004; 10.1177/1049731519832101; 10.1542/peds.2010-2297; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2015.12.014; 10.1007/s10488-020-01080-9; 10.1177/1077559516657637; 10.1093/cs/cds005; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2010.09.007; 10.1080/15548732.2019.1621234; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105834; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2016.10.043; 10.1080/15548732.2016.1140107; 10.1080/15332640.2014.947460; 10.1080/0145935X.2019.1656063; 10.18584/iipj.2013.4.2.2; 10.1111/fcre.12404; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.104957; 10.1007/s10560-014-0334-8; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2009.06.006; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2017.05.005; 10.1111/cfs.12002; 10.1016/j.drugpo.2015.05.025; 10.1080/15548730903563095; 10.1606/1044-3894.2015.96.7; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2019.104389; 10.11124/JBIES-20-00071; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2010.06.017; 10.1080/15548732.2017.1340221; 10.1080/15548732.2020.1814478; 10.1080/15548732.2014.948584; 10.1111/hsc.13335; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2018.10.014; 10.1080/13575279.2016.1199536; 10.1111/j.1365-2214.2011.01287.x; 10.1016/j.pedn.2020.05.009; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2011.02.007; 10.1177/1044389419847326; 10.1016/j.chc.2016.12.008; 10.1080/13575279.2019.1701413; 10.1080/09503153.2019.1704236; 10.1542/peds.2014-2279; 10.1002/car.1154; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2015.03.017; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2012.01.002; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2011.11.004; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2013.05.014; 10.1002/car.2385; 10.1080/09503153.2016.1162287; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105188; 10.1111/cfs.12236; 10.1080/10926755.2016.1149535; 10.1177/1049731513491835; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2016.10.017; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.08.025; 10.1080/19371918.2014.938388; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2012.02594.x; 10.1111/cfs.12301; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2017.09.020; 10.1007/s40653-019-0250-3; 10.1080/15433710802683796; 10.1111/cfs.12049; 10.1177/1524838016669503; 10.1111/ijsw.12323; 10.1007/s00127-021-02069-x; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105454; 10.1111/cfs.12208","The authors declare no conflict of interest.

"36359807","The Adverse Outcome Pathway Framework Applied to Neurological Symptoms of COVID-19.","Helena T Hogberg, Ann Lam, Elan Ohayon, Muhammad Ali Shahbaz, Laure-Alix Clerbaux, Anna Bal-Price, Sandra Coecke, Rachel Concha, Francesca De Bernardi,  ..., Magdalini Sachana","Several reports have shown that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the potential to also be neurotropic. However, the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 induces neurologic injury, including neurological and/or psychological symptoms, remain unclear. In this review, the available knowledge on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying COVID-19 was organized using the AOP framework. Four AOPs leading to neurological adverse outcomes (AO), anosmia, encephalitis, stroke, and seizure, were developed. Biological key events (KEs) identified to induce these AOs included binding to ACE2, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, hypoxia, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. The modularity of AOPs allows the construction of AOP networks to visualize core pathways and recognize neuroinflammation and BBB disruption as shared mechanisms. Furthermore, the impact on the neurological AOPs of COVID-19 by modulating and multiscale factors such as age, psychological stress, nutrition, poverty, and food insecurity was discussed. Organizing the existing knowledge along an AOP framework can represent a valuable tool to understand disease mechanisms and identify data gaps and potentially contribute to treatment, and prevention. This AOP-aligned approach also facilitates synergy between experts from different backgrounds, while the fast-evolving and disruptive nature of COVID-19 emphasizes the need for interdisciplinarity and cross-community research.",2022,10,28,"Cells","10.3390/cells11213411","PMC9658029","Cells","eng","D006801; D000086382; D000073931; D000086402; D001812; D020521","Humans; COVID-19; Adverse Outcome Pathways; SARS-CoV-2; Blood-Brain Barrier; Stroke",NA,"10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30076-X; 10.1001/jamaneurol.2020.1127; 10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.031; 10.3389/fneur.2020.00308; 10.1016/j.dsx.2021.04.007; 10.1038/s41467-022-29521-z; 10.1002/etc.34; 10.1177/1073858420956905; 10.1080/10408363.2020.1860895; 10.1152/jn.00255.2022; 10.1007/s10072-021-05505-7; 10.31083/j.jin2103077; 10.1021/acschemneuro.1c00353; 10.3389/fpubh.2021.638605; 10.14573/altex.2102221; 10.1177/026119291604400504; 10.1080/09553002.2021.1884314; 10.1186/s12989-020-00344-4; 10.1089/aivt.2017.0013; 10.3233/JAD-201418; 10.1093/toxsci/kfu199; 10.1007/s00203-021-02606-x; 10.1056/NEJMoa2021436; 10.14573/altex.2112161; 10.1007/s11427-020-1637-5; 10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052; 10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7; 10.1038/s41586-020-2772-0; 10.1038/s41582-020-0398-3; 10.3389/fcell.2021.684874; 10.3390/jcm9051417; 10.1126/science.abd2985; 10.1038/s41593-020-00758-5; 10.1007/s00401-021-02314-2; 10.1016/j.nbd.2020.105131; 10.1016/j.nbd.2021.105561; 10.1016/S1474-4422(20)30308-2; 10.1056/NEJMc2033369; 10.1126/science.abm2052; 10.1038/s41421-021-00290-1; 10.1101/2021.02.09.430314; 10.1038/s41586-022-04702-4; 10.1177/1753425920954281; 10.1007/s00401-020-02190-2; 10.3390/cells9112360; 10.1016/j.stemcr.2021.12.011; 10.1002/jmv.25915; 10.3390/ijms22052681; 10.1056/NEJMc2019373; 10.1093/brain/awab148; 10.1007/s12028-021-01220-5; 10.1172/JCI84433; 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2008.07.023; 10.1186/s12974-021-02282-0; 10.1016/j.cytogfr.2021.02.002; 10.1212/WNL.0000000000010111; 10.1016/S0378-4274(98)00324-5; 10.1111/j.1750-3639.1990.tb00630.x; 10.1177/0960327107074589; 10.1016/S0301-0082(98)00069-0; 10.3390/ijerph8072980; 10.3390/brainsci3031109; 10.1002/glia.1107; 10.1385/MN:27:3:325; 10.2174/1568006043481284; 10.1177/1759091420954960; 10.1016/j.xcrm.2021.100288; 10.1016/j.bbi.2020.12.022; 10.1212/WNL.0000000000012530; 10.1016/S1474-4422(15)70016-5; 10.1007/s12035-020-02094-y; 10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100484; 10.1111/jth.14820; 10.1002/ana.24647; 10.1074/jbc.M311768200; 10.1093/femspd/ftaa033; 10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.044; 10.1038/s41591-020-0868-6; 10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.037; 10.1002/iid3.387; 10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102581; 10.1002/lary.29286; 10.1007/s11356-021-15588-6; 10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00210; 10.1016/j.cell.2022.01.024; 10.1007/s00405-021-07153-1; 10.3390/cells11193027; 10.37825/2239-9747.1007; 10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.062; 10.7150/ijbs.45072; 10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100127; 10.1146/annurev.immunol.021908.132528; 10.1155/2013/510396; 10.1172/JCI97229; 10.1016/j.clineuro.2020.105921; 10.3389/fcvm.2021.649922; 10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.104941; 10.26355/eurrev_202012_24210; 10.1111/epi.12550; 10.1016/j.msard.2020.102535; 10.1016/j.seizure.2018.04.023; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2019.04.038; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.02.007; 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2012.03703.x; 10.1007/s10072-020-04932-2; 10.3201/eid1002.030638; 10.1373/clinchem.2003.025437; 10.1002/etc.4124; 10.3390/jcm11154464; 10.31083/j.rcm2301028; 10.1186/s12879-022-07062-6; 10.15585/mmwr.mm7036e2; 10.1289/ehp.00108s3511; 10.1016/j.medj.2021.04.016; 10.1172/JCI139569; 10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.023; 10.1001/jama.2020.4621; 10.1093/humrep/deaa367; 10.2196/26477; 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.05.015; 10.1002/uog.23744; 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2021.108841; 10.1007/s10072-021-05068-7; 10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30287-X; 10.1007/s42399-020-00363-4; 10.1212/WNL.0000000000012930; 10.3233/JAD-200581; 10.1186/s40035-021-00237-2; 10.1093/gerona/glaa183; 10.1136/bmj.m1985; 10.3390/ijms22041687; 10.3389/fgene.2021.741175; 10.1093/gerona/glaa169; 10.1016/j.stem.2020.12.018; 10.1186/s13195-021-00850-3; 10.1093/brain/awab337; 10.1002/alz.056282; 10.1002/alz.056706; 10.3390/biology11010061; 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.1.102803.144141; 10.1155/2022/8111022; 10.1016/j.metabol.2019.153951; 10.3233/JAD-2011-110821; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.01.046; 10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.032; 10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105107; 10.1007/s11469-020-00330-z; 10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04399; 10.1001/jamainternmed.2022.1118; 10.1038/s41598-021-99610-4","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","Environment Health and Safety Division, Environment Directorate, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), 75016 Paris, France."

Participants included 226 people between the ages of 18 and 60 who have been living in vulnerable contexts throughout life in Santiago, Chile. Data was collected through a battery of psychological assessments. A structural equation model (SEM) was implemented to examine the interrelationships among cognitive and social variables. Results indicate a significant relationship between executive function (EF) and SA through both social cognition (SC) and intelligence. Theory of Mind (ToM), a component of SC, was shown to exhibit a significant relationship with affective empathy; interestingly, this was negatively related to SA. Moreover, fluid intelligence (FI) was found to exhibit a positive, indirect relationship with SA through crystallized intelligence (CI). Evaluation of these results in the context of research on the impacts of SES and vulnerable living conditions on psychological function may allow for the development of more effective clinical, political, and social interventions to support psychosocial health among socially vulnerable populations.",2022,11,4,"Scientific reports","10.1038/s41598-022-21985-9","PMC9636196","Sci Rep","eng","D000328; D006801; D000293; D055815; D008875; D056344; D000083282; D009483; D035862; D007360; D003071","Adult; Humans; Adolescent; Young Adult; Middle Aged; Executive Function; Social Cognition; Neuropsychological Tests; Vulnerable Populations; Intelligence; Cognition","777-111577757638; N &#x30a; 1201486; 1210195; 2017-1820; 15150012; BPIN2018000100059; CI 5316; PRX19/00147; R01 AG057234; 1210176; 844-11158446727; 20201680192400001E; 80740-495-2020","10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01067; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05336.x; 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01363; 10.1073/pnas.0811910106; 10.1371/journal.pone.0024858; 10.3758/s13423-018-1459-0; 10.1111/jora.12583; 10.1126/science.1238041; 10.1007/s10802-008-9232-x; 10.1080/23279095.2016.1185425; 10.1017/S0140525X16001618; 10.3389/fneur.2018.00491; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.10.032; 10.1038/s41398-017-0082-6; 10.1093/brain/awp041; 10.1080/09084280903297727; 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00297; 10.1080/13546805.2018.1461618; 10.1111/1469-7610.00715; 10.1080/13546805.2012.721728; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.04.037; 10.1016/j.schres.2007.11.011; 10.1136/jnnp-2011-301849; 10.1162/089892998562942; 10.1007/s10919-011-0108-3; 10.1186/2040-2392-4-33; 10.1080/13546800902901518; 10.1023/B:JADD.0000022607.19833.00; 10.1017/S0033291703001624; 10.1016/j.paid.2011.07.005; 10.1017/SJP.2021.2; 10.1016/j.jad.2015.01.042; 10.1111/0081-1750.00078; 10.1080/00273171.2018.1455142; 10.1207/s15328007sem1203_7; 10.1037/a0033266; 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04270_1.x; 10.1016/j.tics.2010.06.009; 10.1093/scan/nsv065; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.10.009; 10.1155/2018/1849794; 10.1080/10683160500255307; 10.1371/journal.pone.0218236; 10.1016/j.intell.2019.05.002; 10.1027/1015-5759/a000123; 10.1037/0033-2909.131.1.30; 10.1037/0033-2909.131.1.66; 10.1037/0033-2909.131.1.61; 10.1093/scan/nsq081; 10.1073/pnas.1010076108; 10.1002/acp.727; 10.1037/pspi0000028; 10.3389/fnhum.2013.00287; 10.1016/j.intell.2006.09.004; 10.3389/fneur.2021.599378","The authors declare no competing interests.","Center for Social and Cognitive Neuroscience (CSCN), School of Psychology, Universidad Adolfo Ib&#xe1;&#xf1;ez, Santiago de Chile, Chile."

"36316708","Artificial intelligence-derived neurofibrillary tangle burden is associated with antemortem cognitive impairment.","Gabriel A Marx, Daniel G Koenigsberg, Andrew T McKenzie, Justin Kauffman, Russell W Hanson, Kristen Whitney, Maxim Signaevsky, Marcel Prastawa,  ..., Megan A Iida","Tauopathies are a category of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the presence of abnormal tau protein-containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). NFTs are universally observed in aging, occurring with or without the concomitant accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (A&#x3b2;) in plaques that typifies Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common tauopathy. Primary age-related tauopathy (PART) is an A&#x3b2;-independent process that affects the medial temporal lobe in both cognitively normal and impaired subjects. Determinants of symptomology in subjects with PART are poorly understood and require clinicopathologic correlation; however, classical approaches to staging tau pathology have limited quantitative reproducibility. As such, there is a critical need for unbiased methods to quantitatively analyze tau pathology on the histological level. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) generate highly accurate and precise computer vision assessments of digitized pathology slides, yielding novel histology metrics at scale. Here, we performed a retrospective autopsy study of a large cohort (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;706) of human post-mortem brain tissues from normal and cognitively impaired elderly individuals with mild or no A&#x3b2; plaques (average age of death of 83.1&#xa0;yr, range 55-110). We utilized a CNN trained to segment NFTs on hippocampus sections immunohistochemically stained with antisera recognizing abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), which yielded metrics of regional NFT counts, NFT positive pixel density, as well as a novel graph-theory based metric measuring the spatial distribution of NFTs. We found that several AI-derived NFT metrics significantly predicted the presence of cognitive impairment in both the hippocampus proper and entorhinal cortex (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). When controlling for age, AI-derived NFT counts still significantly predicted the presence of cognitive impairment (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04 in the entorhinal cortex; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04 overall). In contrast, Braak stage did not predict cognitive impairment in either age-adjusted or unadjusted models. These findings support the hypothesis that NFT burden correlates with cognitive impairment in PART. Furthermore, our analysis strongly suggests that AI-derived metrics of tau pathology provide a powerful tool that can deepen our understanding of the role of neurofibrillary degeneration in cognitive impairment.",2022,10,31,"Acta neuropathologica communications","10.1186/s40478-022-01457-x","PMC9620665","Acta Neuropathol Commun","eng","D006801; D000368; D016874; D001185; D012189; D015203; D016875; D024801; D000544; D058225; D060825","Humans; Aged; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Artificial Intelligence; Retrospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; tau Proteins; Tauopathies; Alzheimer Disease; Plaque, Amyloid; Cognitive Dysfunction","R01 NS086736; R01 AG062348; R01 AG054008; P30 AG066514; K01 AG070326; P50 AG005138; R01 NS095252","10.1212/WNL.42.3.631; 10.1007/s00018-007-7220-x; 10.1007/s00401-014-1349-0; 10.1590/S1980-57642015DN91000002; 10.1111/bpa.12248; 10.1093/jnen/nly132; 10.1016/j.jalz.2017.01.028; 10.1016/0197-4580(95)00021-6; 10.1016/S0197-4580(97)00074-2; 10.1016/j.conb.2019.11.008; 10.1007/s004010050780; 10.5414/NPP30056; 10.3233/JAD-160521; 10.1007/s00401-021-02379-z; 10.1093/brain/awr209; 10.1007/s004010051163; 10.1186/s40478-021-01233-3; 10.1016/j.legalmed.2016.08.007; 10.1002/alz.12321; 10.1001/archneur.56.6.713; 10.1046/j.0919-6544.2001.00425.x; 10.1111/j.1365-2559.2006.02513.x; 10.1038/s41592-018-0261-2; 10.1038/s41591-019-0508-1; 10.1016/j.ajpath.2019.05.007; 10.1038/s41467-019-10212-1; 10.1038/s41374-019-0202-4; 10.1186/s40478-022-01425-5; 10.1093/jnen/nlab005; 10.1186/s40478-022-01318-7; 10.1186/s40478-022-01365-0; 10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2644615; 10.1017/S1041610297004870; 10.1097/nen.0b013e31815c5efb; 10.1002/mds.27198; 10.1212/01.WNL.0000063311.58879.01; 10.1007/s00401-020-02197-9; 10.1007/s00401-021-02373-5; 10.1186/s40478-018-0619-9; 10.1007/s00702-016-1635-1; 10.1089/neu.2018.6348; 10.1002/ana.24711; 10.1111/nan.12197; 10.3390/ijms19030645; 10.1093/brain/awv081; 10.1002/cbic.201800288; 10.1007/s00018-019-03349-1; 10.1093/brain/awz403; 10.1093/jnen/nlaa153; 10.1001/jamaneurol.2013.3961; 10.1212/WNL.0000000000010454","G.F., J.Z., and C.C-C., serve as executive leadership for PerciseDx a private company.","Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, 1 Gustave L.

Mothers reported socioeconomic demographics, infant sleep quality (Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire) and maternal subjective stress (Perceived Stress Scale). Maternal objective stress was measured via hair cortisol concentration (HCC). The associations among SES, infant sleep quality, infant co-rooming, and maternal stress were assessed. Infants from families with lower income-to-needs (ITN) ratios had poorer infant sleep quality.

We investigated the associations of six types of specific psychotic experiences and negative symptoms assessed in mid-adolescence with well-established environmental and genetic risk factors for psychosis.

A shift in gene expression profiles in the immune system is one biological mechanism thought to account for elevated disease susceptibility, with a frequently-investigated profile being the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA), characterized by increased expression of proinflammatory genes and decreased expression of antiviral and antibody-related genes. The present study investigated, in a sample of at-risk midlife adults (<i>N</i> = 88), whether those randomized to learn loving-kindness meditation (LKM) in a 6-week workshop, would show a reduction in CTRA gene expression, compared to those randomized to learn mindfulness meditation (MM). We assessed emotions daily and hypothesized positive emotions to account for the expected effect of LKM on gene expression. Results showed significant group differences from pre- to post-intervention, yet in the opposite direction as hypothesized: Participants randomized to the MM group showed significant declines in CTRA gene expression, whereas those in the LKM group showed significant increases in CTRA gene expression. Both groups showed increases over the 6 weeks in daily reports of positive emotions, <i>b</i>=.007, <i>p</i> &lt;.001 alongside decreases in negative emotions <i>b</i>=-.005, <i>p</i> &lt;.001. Thus, positive emotions were not pursued as a candidate mediator of observed group effects. This study is the first to examine whether the biological impact of childhood low-SES can be reversed in mid-life through meditation interventions. Results suggest mindfulness meditation may be a viable option for improving health outcomes in this at-risk population.

Employing a retrospective cohort design, we do a secondary analysis of data from a cohort of people with TRS attending the South London and Maudsley. Regression analyses were conducted to identify the correlates of the length of treatment to TRS. Predictors included the following: gender, age, ethnicity, problems with positive symptoms, problems with activities of daily living, psychiatric comorbidities, involuntary hospitalisation and treatment with long-acting injectable antipsychotics. In a cohort of 164 people with TRS (60% were men), the median length of treatment to TRS was 3&#x2009;years and 8&#x2009;months. We observed no cut-off on the length of treatment until TRS presentation differentiating between early and late TRS (i.e. no bimodal distribution). Having mild to very severe problems with hallucinations and delusions at the treatment start was associated with earlier TRS (~19&#x2009;months earlier). In sensitivity analyses, including only complete cases (subject to selection bias), treatment with a long-acting injectable antipsychotic was additionally associated with later TRS (~15&#x2009;months later). Our findings do not support a clear separation between early and late TRS but rather a continuum of the length of treatment before TRS onset. Having mild to very severe problems with positive symptoms at treatment start predicts earlier onset of TRS.",2022,11,1,"Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)","10.1177/02698811221132537","PMC9643817","J Psychopharmacol","</AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Ridler</LastName><ForeName>Isobel</ForeName><Initials>I</Initials><Identifier Source=""ORCID"">0000-0003-2196-4733</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Pritchard</LastName><ForeName>Megan</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Shetty</LastName><ForeName>Hitesh</ForeName><Initials>H</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Segev</LastName><ForeName>Aviv</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Shalvata Mental Health Center, Hod Hasharon, Israel.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Casetta</LastName><ForeName>Cecilia</ForeName><Initials>C</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Health Sciences, Universit&#xe0; degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Smart</LastName><ForeName>Sophie E</ForeName><Initials>SE</Initials><Identifier Source=""ORCID"">0000-0002-6709-5425</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Morris</LastName><ForeName>Anna</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Downs</LastName><ForeName>Johnny</ForeName><Initials>J</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Christensen</LastName><ForeName>S&#xf8;ren Rahn</ForeName><Initials>SR</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>H.

"36262371","Stable cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin and &#x3b2;-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 levels differentiate predementia Alzheimer's disease patients.","Bj&#xf8;rn Eivind Kirsebom, Grit Richter, Kaja Nordengen, Dag Aarsland, Geir Br&#xe5;then, Betty M Tijms, Pieter Jelle Visser, Johanna Nilsson, Per Selnes,  ..., Tormod Fladby","Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) &#x3b2;-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), neurogranin and the neurogranin/BACE1 ratio are proposed markers for Alzheimer's disease. BACE1 is also a drug target. However, CSF levels may differ between early-stage amyloid plaque formation (A) and later stage downstream tau-tangle pathology (T) and neurodegeneration (N) and may be expressed as an A/T/N stage (e.g. A+/T-/N or A+/T+/N+). Whether BACE1 and neurogranin levels are persistent traits or change with disease progression is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether CSF neurogranin and BACE1 concentrations differ between A/T/N stages, whether these change over time and correlate with memory decline. This may have implications for patient selection in future trials. We used CSF markers to determine A/T/N stage using amyloid beta42/40 ratio, p-tau181 and total-tau respectively in predementia Alzheimer's disease cases (<i>n</i> = 176) [including cases that progressed to dementia (<i>n</i> = 10)] and controls (<i>n</i> = 74) from the Norwegian Dementia Disease Initiation cohort. We selected cases at the presumed early (A+/T-/N-, <i>n</i> = 86) and late stages (A+/T+/N+, <i>n</i> = 90) of the Alzheimer's disease continuum and controlled with normal markers (A-/T-/N-, <i>n</i> = 74). A subset of subjects in all A/T/N groups underwent repeat CSF sampling at approximately 2-year intervals up to 6 years from baseline. Using linear mixed models, longitudinal measurements of CSF BACE1 and neurogranin levels in A+/T-/N- and A+/T+/N+ as compared to A-/T-/N- healthy controls were performed. Next, we measured changes in CSF BACE1 and neurogranin levels in cases that progressed from A-/T-/N- to A+/T-/N- (<i>n</i> = 12), from A+/T-/N- to A+/T or N+ (<i>n</i> = 12), remained stable A+/T-/N- (<i>n</i> = 26), remained stable A+/T+/N+ (<i>n</i> = 28) compared with controls remaining stable A-/T-/N- (<i>n</i> = 33). Lastly, associations between these markers and memory decline were assessed. Compared with A-/T-/N- healthy controls, neurogranin was unaltered in A+/T-/N- (n.s.) but higher in A+/T+/N+ (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, BACE1 was lower in A+/T-/N- (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) and higher in A+/T+/N+ (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001). The neurogranin/BACE1 ratio was increased in both A+/T-/N- (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) and A+/T+/N+ (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001) groups as compared to A-/T-/N- healthy controls and was more strongly associated with memory decline (b = -0.29, <i>P</i> = 0.0006) than neurogranin (b = -0.20, <i>P</i> = 0.002) and BACE1 (b = -0.13, <i>P</i> = 0.046). Neurogranin and BACE1 level differences remained stable over time not only within A/T/N groups but also in patients progressing to more pathological A/T/N stages (e.g. progressing from A+/T-/N- to A + T or N+) and in cases progressing to dementia. Our results suggest that neurogranin and BACE1 levels may differentiate pathomechanistic Alzheimer's disease subgroups, putatively with different options for treatment.",2022,1,1,"Brain communications","10.1093/braincomms/fcac244","PMC9562788","Brain Commun","eng",NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Neurology, Akershus University Hospital, 1478 L&#xf8;renskog, Norway."
"36255055","Lack of ownership of mobile phones could hinder the rollout of mHealth interventions in Africa.","Justin T Okano, Joan Ponce, Matthias Kr&#xf6;nke, Sally Blower","Mobile health (mHealth) interventions, which require ownership of mobile phones, are being investigated throughout Africa. We estimate the percentage of individuals who own mobile phones in 33 African countries, identify a relationship between ownership and proximity to a health clinic (HC), and quantify inequities in ownership. We investigate basic mobile phones (BPs) and smartphones (SPs): SPs can connect to the internet, BPs cannot. We use nationally representative data collected in 2017-2018 from 44,224 individuals in Round 7 of the Afrobarometer surveys. We use Bayesian multilevel logistic regression models for our analyses. We find 82% of individuals in 33 countries own mobile phones: 42% BPs and 40% SPs. Individuals who live close to an HC have higher odds of ownership than those who do not (aOR: 1.31, Bayesian 95% highest posterior density [HPD] region: 1.24-1.39). Men, compared with women, have over twice the odds of ownership (aOR: 2.37, 95% HPD region: 1.96-2.84). Urban residents, compared with rural residents, have almost three times the odds (aOR: 2.66, 95% HPD region: 2.22-3.18) and, amongst mobile phone owners, nearly three times the odds of owning an SP (aOR: 2.67, 95% HPD region: 2.33-3.10). Ownership increases with age, peaks in 26-40 year olds, then decreases. Individuals under 30 are more likely to own an SP than a BP, older individuals more likely to own a BP than an SP. Probability of ownership decreases with the Lived Poverty Index; however, some of the poorest individuals own SPs. If the digital devices needed for mHealth interventions are not equally available within the population (which we have found is the current situation), rolling out mHealth interventions in Africa is likely to propagate already existing inequities in access to healthcare. Many healthcare systems in African countries are under-resourced. As a result, people, particularly those living in rural areas, often have to travel large distances to access the medical care they need. Mobile phone-based interventions (also known as mHealth) could make a substantial difference. In Africa, mHealth is already used to diagnose and treat diseases, increase adolescents&#x2019; use of sexual and reproductive health services, boost HIV prevention and treatment, and improve maternal and child healthcare. However, using mHealth services requires owning a basic mobile phone or, in some cases, a smartphone that can access the internet. While mobile phone ownership in Africa is increasing rapidly, data on who has them and what types of phones they have are limited. If geographic, income, or gender-based inequities exist, mHealth interventions may not be able to reach those who would benefit the most. To close this knowledge gap, Okano et al. analyzed data on the mobile phone ownership of people living in 33 of the 54 countries in Africa. They used mathematical models and data collected from 44,224 people in Afrobarometer, a continent-wide survey conducted between 2017 and 2018. Okano et al. estimated that 80% of African adults in these 33 countries owned a mobile phone, and half of these devices were smartphones. Although ownership levels varied between the 33 countries, there were substantial inequities that appeared across all of them. More men than women owned a mobile phone. Residents in urban areas and wealthy individuals were also more likely to have a mobile phone than people living in rural areas and poorer individuals, respectively. However, in some countries, the least wealthy were also found to sometimes own smartphones. Okano et al. also found that people living closer to a health clinic were more likely to have a mobile phone than those living further away. Mobile phone ownership was also higher between 26 to 40 year olds, and then decreased with age. In addition, people under 30 were more likely to have a smartphone, whereas older individuals were more likely to own a mobile phone that does not connect to the internet. These findings suggest that there are large inequities in mobile phone ownership. If these are not addressed, rolling out mHealth interventions could worsen existing health disparities in African countries. Efforts need to be made across the continent to expand access to phone devices and reduce substantial internet costs. This will ensure that mHealth interventions benefit everyone across Africa, particularly those who need them most.",2022,10,18,"eLife","10.7554/eLife.79615","PMC9640192","Elife","eng","D008297; D005260; D006801; D010067; D001499; D040421; D017216; D000068997","Male; Female; Humans; Ownership; Bayes Theorem; Cell Phone; Telemedicine; Smartphone","R01 AI167713; R56 AI152759","10.21037/mhealth.2017.05.04; 10.1038/s41467-018-07536-9; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.01.011; 10.3390/ijerph19137780; 10.1371/journal.pone.0185699; 10.3390/ijerph111111559; 10.18637/jss.v080.i01; 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047556; 10.1111/mcn.12825; 10.1093/afraf/adq045; 10.2196/25273; 10.1214/ss/1177011136; 10.1214/06-BA117A; 10.1214/08-AOAS191; 10.1201/b16018; 10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30027-3; 10.1057/s41599-021-00848-0; 10.2196/13263; 10.1093/jtm/taz019; 10.1007/s10461-014-0729-8; 10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002524; 10.1111/oik.05985; 10.2139/ssrn.2623083; 10.1016/j.jmva.2009.04.008; 10.7189/jogh.10.020438; 10.1007/s10461-021-03402-w; 10.1371/journal.pone.0199687; 10.1186/s40249-020-00677-4; 10.1186/s12884-019-2531-0; 10.7189/jogh.09.020425; 10.1200/JGO.19.00191; 10.9745/GHSP-D-20-00685; 10.1186/s43058-021-00230-w; 10.2196/20330; 10.2196/mhealth.7792; 10.1371/journal.pone.0261973; 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036641; 10.1186/s12911-020-01381-x; 10.1186/s12942-017-0107-7; 10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30351-X; 10.1002/jid.3340; 10.1080/02681102.2019.1622500; 10.1371/journal.pone.0237337; 10.1186/s12879-019-4338-z; 10.1176/appi.ps.202000086; 10.1007/s10461-018-2103-8; 10.2196/publichealth.9015; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.04.046; 10.1371/journal.pone.0035319; 10.31234/osf.io/7tbrm; 10.1038/s41586-019-0956-2","JO, JP, MK, SB No competing interests declared","Center for Biomedical Modeling, Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, United States."

However, knowledge about prevalence of treatment dropout and its risk factors in routine care is limited. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for dropout in a large outpatient sample. In this retrospective cohort analysis, routinely collected data from 2235 outpatients with MDD who had a diagnostic work-up between 2014 and 2016 were examined. Dropout was defined as treatment termination without achieving remission before the fourth session within six months after its start. Total and item scores on the Dutch Measure for Quantification of Treatment Resistance in Depression (DM-TRD) at baseline, and demographic variables were analyzed for their association with dropout using logistic regression and elastic net analyses. Data of 987 subjects who started routine outpatient depression treatment were included in the analyses of which 143 (14.5%) dropped out. Higher DM-TRD-scores were predictive for lower dropout odds [OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.78, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;(0.70-0.86), p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001]. The elastic net analysis revealed several clinical variables predictive for dropout. Higher SES, higher depression severity, comorbid personality pathology and a comorbid anxiety disorder were significantly associated with less dropout in the sample. In this observational study, treatment dropout was relatively low. The DM-TRD, an easy-to-use clinical instrument, revealed several variables associated with less dropout. When applied in daily practice and combined with demographical information, this instrument may help to reduce dropout and increase treatment effectiveness.",2023,8,1,"European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience","10.1007/s00406-022-01499-1","PMC10359217","Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci","eng","D006801; D003863; D003865; D012189; D015995; D016896; D000553","Humans; Depression; Depressive Disorder, Major; Retrospective Studies; Prevalence; Treatment Outcome; Ambulatory Care",NA,"NA","Dr. Ruh&#xe9; had received speaking fees from Janssen and Lundbeck and grants from ZonMW, Horizon 2020 and Hersenstichting.

We examined associations among PTSD, cardiovascular indices, and metabolic function in highly trauma-exposed Black women with T2DM. Participants (<i>N</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;80) were recruited for a follow-up study of stress and T2DM as part of the Grady Trauma Project. PTSD symptoms were assessed with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV). Cardiovascular indices included heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and endothelial function (assessed via flow-mediated dilation; FMD).

Neither infection-related impacts nor psychosocial disruption were related to vaccine hesitancy after adjusting for related sociodemographic covariates. However, perceptions of higher quality care received during COVID-19 illness predicted decreased COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Furthermore, mediation analysis revealed that perceived care quality during COVID-19 illness mediate the relationship between objective socioeconomic risk and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. These findings highlight patient-reported care quality during illness as a novel target that may increase vaccine uptake among socioeconomically vulnerable populations.",2022,12,1,"Preventive medicine reports","10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.102020","PMC9550282","Prev Med Rep","eng",NA,NA,"R01 MH126468; R34 DA050287","10.1038/s41591-022-01699-1; 10.1177/2150131917697439; 10.1080/10410236.2019.1625006; 10.15585/mmwr.mm7022e1; 10.1001/jama.2021.8246; 10.1007/978-1-4020-6174-5_2; 10.1016/j.pmedr.2020.101292; 10.1016/j.jcjq.2021.09.003; 10.2471/BLT.16.179309; 10.15585/mmwr.mm6643a3; 10.1007/978-3-642-04898-2_455; 10.3389/fpubh.2021.698111; 10.1186/s12939-021-01582-4; 10.1016/j.bbih.2021.100277; 10.3390/vaccines9010016; 10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.04.036; 10.1007/s12178-012-9137-8; 10.1093/eurpub/ckab220; 10.7189/jogh.11.05027; 10.1016/j.ygyno.2021.08.007; 10.1016/j.lanwpc.2021.100241; 10.1097/JNC.0000000000000189; 10.1111/ans.16543; 10.1056/NEJMoa2116063; 10.1038/s41598-021-02321-z; 10.1016/j.amepre.2006.04.006; 10.1038/s41597-021-01103-6; 10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101673; 10.21105/joss.01686; 10.1177/135910539700200305; 10.1037/hea0000242; 10.1007/s10995-007-0302-4","The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.","Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, United States."

We combined data from ten prospective, first-episode psychosis cohorts from across Europe and categorised patients as TR or non-treatment resistant (NTR) after a mean follow up of 4.18&#xa0;years (s.d.&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.20) for secondary data analysis. We identified a list of potential predictors from clinical and demographic data recorded at first-episode. These potential predictors were entered in two models: a multivariable logistic regression to identify which were independently associated with TR and a penalised logistic regression, which performed variable selection, to produce a parsimonious prediction model. This model was internally validated using a 5-fold, 50-repeat cross-validation optimism-correction. Our sample consisted of N&#xa0;=&#xa0;2216 participants of which 385 (17&#xa0;%) developed TR. Younger age of psychosis onset and fewer years in education were independently associated with increased odds of developing TR. The prediction model selected 7 out of 17 variables that, when combined, could quantify the risk of being TR better than chance. These included age of onset, years in education, gender, BMI, relationship status, alcohol use, and positive symptoms. The optimism-corrected area under the curve was 0.59 (accuracy&#xa0;=&#xa0;64&#xa0;%, sensitivity&#xa0;=&#xa0;48&#xa0;%, and specificity&#xa0;=&#xa0;76&#xa0;%).

In the context of Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC), a leading risk factor is gender disparity. Addressing gender disparity, by involving fathers, mothers in law and other family members can significantly improve perinatal and maternal healthcare, including risk factors for poor perinatal mental health such as domestic violence and poor social support. This highlights the need to develop and implement gender-transformative (GT) interventions that seek to engage with men and reduce or overcome gender-based constraints. This scoping review aimed to highlight existing gender transformative interventions from LMIC that specifically aimed to address perinatal mental health (partner violence, anxiety or depression and partner support) and identify components of the intervention that were found to be useful and acceptable. This review follows the five-stage Arksey and O'Malley framework and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. Six papers that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review (four from Africa and two from Asia). Common components of gender transformative interventions across studies included couple-based interventions and discussion groups.

Cognitive measures included the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Animal Fluency (AF) and the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Word Learning (CERAD-WL) and Delayed Recall (CERAD-DR) tasks. Analyses examined the relationship between the number of term and incomplete pregnancies with cognitive performance, as well as the mediating effects of education and the federal income-to-poverty ratio (PIR).

Despite co-occurring risk factors for parental incarceration and foster care, little is known about the prevalence or characteristics of youth navigating both of these experiences. This study details the prevalence of youth at the intersection of parental incarceration and foster care, their demographic characteristics, and heterogeneity in their mental health. Data come from the 2019 Minnesota Student Survey with 112,157 eighth-, ninth-, and eleventh-grade students. Logistic regression with interactions between parental incarceration and foster care predict associated odds of youth's anxiety and depression; self-injurious behavior, suicidal ideation and attempt; and mental health diagnoses and treatment. Nearly 2&#xa0;% of students experienced both parental incarceration and foster care, with a disproportionate number of those identifying as youth of color, experiencing poverty, and/or living in rural communities. Both parental incarceration and foster care were separately linked with poor mental health, yet experiencing both was associated with higher odds of anxiety, depression, self-injury, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, diagnosis, and treatment. Youth with proximal multiplicative exposure (recent foster care and current parental incarceration) reported the most adverse mental health symptoms. The study emboldens what is known about the inequitable distribution of parental incarceration and foster care. These findings highlight the association between dual-systems-impacted youth and mental health indicators, with important implications for increasing access to mental health services while simultaneously calling for systems change.",2022,12,1,"Child abuse &amp; neglect","10.1016/j.chiabu.2022.105910",NA,"Child Abuse Negl","eng","D002648; D000293; D006801; D008603; D015995; D005581; D010290; D008605","Child; Adolescent; Humans; Mental Health; Prevalence; Foster Home Care; Parents; Mental Health Services",NA,"NA","Declaration of competing interest There are no conflicts of interest to disclose.","Division of General Pediatrics and Adolescent Health, University of Minnesota, United States of America."

However, only within the past 5-10 years has the medical community acknowledged the need for well-developed guidelines tailored to the local healthcare needs and the resources available. In most low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), healthcare workers depend on guidelines developed in high-income countries (HICs), yet many interventions validated in a HIC are ineffective when implemented in an LMIC. The variation in infrastructure, medical personnel, technology and environmental conditions exhibited in LMICs relative to HICs necessitates a careful appraisal of the evidence base used in clinical guideline recommendations. This review aims to map the use of resource-stratified guidelines across all fields of medicine. The review seeks to answer three questions for the identified guidelines: (1) what was the method of development, (2) have they been implemented and, if so, (3) have they been validated. The search strategy will aim to locate studies from inception to November 2021. An initial limited search of PubMed and Scopus was undertaken to identify articles on the topic. The text words contained in the titles and abstracts of relevant articles, and the index terms used to describe the articles were used to develop a full search strategy for PubMed and Scopus. This scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews. Data to be extracted from each study will include population characteristics of both developers and intended implementation population, medical specialty, validation status, method of guideline development, whether the study is consensus or evidence-based in addition to a summary of recommendations for practice.

"36170237","Exploring contextual adaptations in caregiver interventions for families raising children with developmental disabilities.","Zsofia Szlamka, Charlotte Hanlon, Bethlehem Tekola, Laura Pacione, Erica Salomone, Chiara Servili, Rosa A Hoekstra","There are increasing efforts to scale up services globally for families raising children with developmental disabilities (DDs). Existing interventions, often developed in high income, Western settings, need substantial adaptation before they can be implemented in different contexts. The aim of this study was to explore perspectives on the role that context plays in the adaptation and implementation of interventions targeting caregivers of children with DDs across settings. The study question was applied to the Caregiver Skills Training (CST) programme of the World Health Organization specifically, as well as to stakeholder experiences with caregiver interventions more broadly. Two focus group discussions (FGDs; n = 15 participants) and 25 individual semi-structured interviews were conducted. Participants were caregivers of children with DDs and professionals involved in adapting or implementing the CST across five continents and different income settings. Data were analysed thematically. Four main themes were developed: 1) Setting the scene for adaptations; 2) Integrating an intervention into local public services; 3) Understanding the reality of caregivers; 4) Challenges of sustaining an intervention. Informants thought that contextual adaptations were key for the intervention to fit in locally, even more so than cultural factors. The socio-economic context of caregivers, including poverty, was highlighted as heavily affecting service access and engagement with the intervention. Competing health priorities other than DDs, financial constraints, and management of long-term collaborations were identified as barriers. This study validates the notion that attention to contextual factors is an essential part of the adaptation of caregiver interventions for children with DDs, by providing perspectives from different geographical regions. We recommend a stronger policy and research focus on contextual adaptations of interventions and addressing unmet socio-economic needs of caregivers.",2022,1,1,"PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0272077","PMC9518887","PLoS One","eng","D017028; D002648; D002658; D017144; D006801; D011203","Caregivers; Child; Developmental Disabilities; Focus Groups; Humans; Poverty","001","10.1016/j.ridd.2010.12.018; 10.1016/S2214-109X(18)30309-7; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002393; 10.1093/inthealth/ihaa044; 10.1002/aur.2276; 10.1093/ije/dyt191; 10.1097/MOP.0b013e32834cf082; 10.1111/j.1365-2753.2006.00674.x; 10.1177/1362361311422708; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001572; 10.2196/mental.5776; 10.3109/10673229.2012.649108; 10.1111/jrh.12229; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.08.004; 10.1111/j.1468-3148.2011.00680.x; 10.1111/jcpp.13404; 10.1542/peds.2015-0861; 10.1002/aur.1978; 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2009.01176.x; 10.1007/s12098-014-1474-8; 10.1016/S2215-0366(15)00388-0; 10.1111/j.1524-4733.2005.04054.x; 10.1186/s13012-018-0815-9; 10.1136/bmj.h1258; 10.1186/s13012-018-0842-6; 10.1186/1748-5908-8-90; 10.1186/1748-5908-8-65; 10.1186/s12913-016-1651-8; 10.1186/s13012-017-0552-5; 10.1007/s10488-007-0121-3; 10.1007/s10488-007-0144-9; 10.1023/a:1019902902119; 10.1037/0033-3204.43.4.531; 10.2147/NDT.S138430; 10.1007/BF01447045; 10.1017/gmh.2016.17; 10.1037/0003-066X.62.6.563; 10.1136/jech-2020-214468; 10.1111/j.1547-5069.2001.00253.x; 10.1353/sof.2006.0023; 10.1177/070674370505000206; 10.1177/1362361317716604; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2015.03.025; 10.1177/13623613211035228; 10.1111/jcpp.13405; 10.1007/s11013-016-9516-5; 10.1111/sode.12430; 10.21037/pm.2019.07.08; 10.1196/annals.1425.011; 10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30060-9; 10.1093/heapol/czp053; 10.1186/s13033-020-00379-2; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.04.005; 10.1093/heapol/czr038; 10.1093/inthealth/ihs037; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.01.012","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."

Data came from the 2017 wave of the nationally-representative National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) in South Africa. We focused on a sample of 15-24-year-olds whose depressive symptoms were assessed using an adapted version of the 10-item Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. We examine how individual dimensions and indicators of the MPI relate to depression, in comparison to more conventional measures, including household income, subjective social standing, overcrowding and personal assets. Cross-sectional analyses were adjusted for clustering to account for sampling design. The MPI index was not associated with probable depression (OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.02, 95&#xa0;% CI 0.81-1.29). Only lack of access to the labour market emerged as a key individual dimension associated with probable depression (OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;5.29, 95&#xa0;% CI 1.70-16.47), a relationship driven by an increased odds for those not in employment, education or training. Lack of household assets, living in an informal dwelling and lower perceived social standing were also associated with increased odds for depression. No gender differences were noted. The study is cross-sectional and not suitable to examine the causal nature of the association between multidimensional poverty and depression. Poverty dimensions that measure youth's access to employment or training have a strong association with depression.

This study aimed to investigate associations of perceived stigma with the country of birth and socioeconomic status (SES). This is a cross-sectional questionnaire study. Participants were recruited consecutively from three demographically different neurology outpatient clinics in the southwest of Sweden. Participants responded to a questionnaire concerning their epilepsy, country of birth, mother tongue, and different SES-variables. The Neuro-QOL stigma scale and the Jacoby stigma scale were applied to assess stigma and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and PROMIS Mental Health scale were applied to assess mental health. In total 161 adults with epilepsy were included in the cohort. The median Neuro-QOL stigma score was 48.3, and was higher among foreign-born than in native-born participants (foreign-born in non-European country 52.3, in other European country 49.8, and in native-born 47.0, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003). Other factors associated with Neuro-QOL were seizure frequency last year (&#x2265;2 seizures 52.4 compared to 1 seizure 50.9 and no seizures 44.3, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), having had seizures in public (yes 50.9 compared to no 44.7, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.035), HADS depression score &#x2265;11 (57.4 compared to 47.8 for score &lt;11 points, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), HADS anxiety score &#x2265;11 (53.5 compared to 46.8 for score &lt;11 points, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), and lower PROMIS Mental Health score (42.9 for PROMIS&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;40 compared to 54.4 for PROMIS&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;60, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01). A stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that having had seizures the last year increased the average Neuro-QOL stigma score with 5.89 and appeared as the most determining factor for the Neuro-QOL stigma score among the variables investigated.

Some internal and external psychosocial resources may mediate or moderate the mother-child relationship, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the predictors of parenting stress in mothers of children with ASD and elucidate the mechanisms underlying the relationship between child social impairment and parenting stress. A cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2020 and March 2022 in Shanghai, China. Mothers of children with ASD completed a survey investigating child social impairment, parenting stress, parental self-efficacy, and social support. A total of 185 mothers of children with ASD were included in the final analysis. 70.27 percent of mothers experienced a clinically significant level of parenting stress. Child social impairment (<i>r</i> = 0.46, <i>P</i> &lt; <i>0.001</i>), parental self-efficacy (<i>r</i> = -0.58, <i>P</i> &lt; <i>0.001</i>), and social support (<i>r</i> = -0.35, <i>P</i> &lt; <i>0.001</i>) were significantly correlated with parenting stress. Parental self-efficacy completely mediated the relationship between child social impairment and parenting stress (<i>B</i> = 0.51, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), after controlling for socioeconomic status (SES) correlated with parenting stress. There was no significant moderating effect of social support between child social impairment and parenting stress (<i>B</i> = 0.01, <i>P</i> = 0.09).

The analysis of the literature showed nine interventions that indicated an improvement in those cognitive functions worked with low SES children. The cognitive domains that most worked were executive functions, followed by social cognition and language. After reviewing the available literature, a clear scarcity of interventions carried out in Spain was observed.

Because children can struggle with tasks in the scanner, we collected fMRI data while 4-to-11-year-olds watched a short film with positive and negative emotional events, and rich parent-child interactions (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;70). We captured broad, normative stressful experiences by examining socioeconomic status (SES) and stressful life events, as well as children's more proximal experiences with their parents. For a sub-sample (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;30), parenting behaviors were measured during a parent-child interaction, consisting of a picture book, a challenging puzzle, and free play with novel toys. We characterized positive parenting behaviors (e.g., warmth, praise) and negative parenting behaviors (e.g., harsh tone, physical control). We found that higher SES was related to greater activity in medial orbitofrontal cortex during parent-child interaction movie events.

In a region-of-interest analysis, we found that stressful life events and negative parenting behaviors were associated with less activation of the amygdala during positive emotional events.

Currently, the predictive power of schizophrenia polygenic risk scores (PRSs) is not large enough to allow highly accurate discrimination between cases and controls and thus is not adequate for clinical integration. Since PRSs are rarely used to reveal biological functions or to validate candidate pathways, to fill this gap, we investigated whether their predictive ability could be improved by building genome-wide (GW-PRSs) and pathway-specific PRSs, using distance- or expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)- based mapping between genetic variants and genes. We focused on five pathways (glutamate, oxidative stress, GABA/interneurons, neuroimmune/neuroinflammation and myelin) which belong to a critical hub of schizophrenia pathophysiology, centred on redox dysregulation/oxidative stress. Analyses were first performed in the Lausanne Treatment and Early Intervention in Psychosis Program (TIPP) study (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;340, cases/controls: 208/132), a sample of first-episode of psychosis patients and matched controls, and then validated in an independent study, the epidemiological and longitudinal intervention program of First-Episode Psychosis in Cantabria (PAFIP) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;352, 224/128). Our results highlighted two main findings. First, GW-PRSs for schizophrenia were significantly associated with early psychosis status. Second, oxidative stress was the only significantly associated pathway that showed an enrichment in both the TIPP (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) and PAFIP samples (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), and exclusively when gene-variant linking was done using eQTLs.

"36127635","Autonomy and health-related quality of life in adolescents.","M&#xe5;rten Eriksson, Eva Boman, Pia Svedberg","Autonomy is recognized as important for individual well-being and constitutes one dimension in the KIDSCREEN-instrument measuring health related quality of life (HRQoL) in children and adolescents. However, the autonomy questions in KIDSCREEN are restricted to opportunities to influence leisure time activities, which is a form of autonomy as volition. Yet, there are other aspects of autonomy that might be related to adolescent's HRQoL. The aims of the present study were first to investigate the psychometric properties of a scale measuring autonomy in adolescence from a control perspective (AAC) including its relation to the autonomy dimension in KIDSCREEN, and second; to investigate AACs ability to predict each of the 10 dimensions constituting KIDSCREEN. Students (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;154) aged 15-16&#xa0;years who were recruited from schools located in both low (two schools) and high (two schools) socioeconomic status (SES) areas in Sweden participated in a cross-sectional study. The adolescents answered a questionnaire including a new 6-item scale measuring perceived autonomy and HRQoL assessed by the KIDSCREEN-52 instrument. A factor analyses was computed to investigate the relation between the items in the AAC scale and the autonomy items in the KIDSCREEN instrument. Hierarchical regression analyses were computed to investigate if the AAC scale predicted HRQoL in any of the 10 dimensions in KIDSCREEN after controlling for gender, SES and the original autonomy scale included in KIDSCREEN. The factor analysis showed that all the items from the autonomy scale loaded in one factor and that all the items from the AAC scale loaded in another dimension. The hierarchical regression models showed that the AAC scale uniquely predicted HRQoL in all dimensions of the KIDSCREEN instrument after controlling for gender, SES and the original autonomy scale included in KIDSCREEN-52. A high level of perceived autonomy was associated with a high level of HRQoL for both scales. A new scale for measuring autonomy from a control perspective has been presented and shown to differ from autonomy as volition.

We reviewed the clinical records of 1,515 patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder and observed that 253 (17%) developed TRS. The Cox LASSO survival model produced an internally validated Harrel's C index of 0.60. A Kaplan-Meier curve indicated that the hazard of developing TRS remained constant over the observation period. Predictors of TRS were: having more inpatient days in the three months before and after the first antipsychotic, more community face-to-face clinical contact in the three months before the first antipsychotic, minor cognitive problems, and younger age at the time of the first antipsychotic.

However, less is known about how naturally occurring community patterns of PAE (including light to moderate exposure) affect brain development, particularly in consideration of commonly occurring concurrent impacts of prenatal tobacco exposure (PTE). Three hundred thirty-two children (ages 8 to 12) living in South Africa's Cape Flats townships underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging. During pregnancy, their mothers reported alcohol and tobacco use, which was used to evaluate PAE and PTE effects on their children's brain structure. Analyses involved the main effects of PAE and PTE (and their interaction) and the effects of PAE and PTE quantity on cortical thickness, surface area, and volume. After false-discovery rate (FDR) correction, PAE was associated with thinner left parahippocampal cortices, while PTE was associated with smaller cortical surface area in the bilateral pericalcarine, left lateral orbitofrontal, right posterior cingulate, right rostral anterior cingulate, left caudal middle frontal, and right caudal anterior cingulate gyri. There were no PAE&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;PTE interactions nor any associations of PAE and PTE exposure on volumetrics that survived FDR correction. PAE was associated with reduction in the structure of the medial temporal lobe, a brain region critical for learning and memory. PTE had stronger and broader associations, including with regions associated with executive function, reward processing, and emotional regulation, potentially reflecting continued postnatal exposure to tobacco (i.e., second-hand smoke exposure). These differential effects are discussed with respect to reduced PAE quantity in our exposed group versus prior studies within this geographical location, the deep poverty in which participants live, and the consequences of apartheid and racially and economically driven payment practices that contributed to heavy drinking in the region. Longer-term follow-up is needed to determine potential environmental and other moderators of the brain findings here and assess the extent to which they endure over time.",2022,11,1,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research","10.1111/acer.14945",NA,"Alcohol Clin Exp Res","eng","D002648; D006801; D005260; D011247; D014026; D013019; D000089822; D011297; D001921; D000431","Child; Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Nicotiana; South Africa; Birth Cohort; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Brain; Ethanol","U01 HD045935; U01 HD045991; U01 HD055154; U01 HD055155; U01 AA016501; R01 AA025653; K01 AA026889","NA",NA,"Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA."
"36113526","Mapping development and health effects of cooking with solid fuels in low-income and middle-income countries, 2000-18: a geospatial modelling study.","","More than 3 billion people do not have access to clean energy and primarily use solid fuels to cook. Use of solid fuels generates household air pollution, which was associated with more than 2 million deaths in 2019. Although local patterns in cooking vary systematically, subnational trends in use of solid fuels have yet to be comprehensively analysed. We estimated the prevalence of solid-fuel use with high spatial resolution to explore subnational inequalities, assess local progress, and assess the effects on health in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) without universal access to clean fuels. We did a geospatial modelling study to map the prevalence of solid-fuel use for cooking at a 5 km&#x2008;&#xd7;&#x2008;5 km resolution in 98 LMICs based on 2&#xb7;1 million household observations of the primary cooking fuel used from 663 population-based household surveys over the years 2000 to 2018. We use observed temporal patterns to forecast household air pollution in 2030 and to assess the probability of attaining the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target indicator for clean cooking. We aligned our estimates of household air pollution to geospatial estimates of ambient air pollution to establish the risk transition occurring in LMICs. Finally, we quantified the effect of residual primary solid-fuel use for cooking on child health by doing a counterfactual risk assessment to estimate the proportion of deaths from lower respiratory tract infections in children younger than 5 years that could be associated with household air pollution. Although primary reliance on solid-fuel use for cooking has declined globally, it remains widespread. 593 million people live in districts where the prevalence of solid-fuel use for cooking exceeds 95%. 66% of people in LMICs live in districts that are not on track to meet the SDG target for universal access to clean energy by 2030. Household air pollution continues to be a major contributor to particulate exposure in LMICs, and rising ambient air pollution is undermining potential gains from reductions in the prevalence of solid-fuel use for cooking in many countries. We estimated that, in 2018, 205&#x2008;000 (95% uncertainty interval 147&#x2008;000-257&#x2008;000) children younger than 5 years died from lower respiratory tract infections that could be attributed to household air pollution. Efforts to accelerate the adoption of clean cooking fuels need to be substantially increased and recalibrated to account for subnational inequalities, because there are substantial opportunities to improve air quality and avert child mortality associated with household air pollution.

A retrospective population-based cohort study was conducted using linked, province-wide administrative health data for all patients &lt;18 years of age who received a diagnosis of concussion, other specified injuries of head, unspecified injury of head, or post-concussion syndrome between April 1, 2004 and March 31, 2018. Data were geospatially mapped. Concussion EOCs increased 2.2-fold over the study period, follow-up visits 5.1-fold. Care was increasingly received in physician office (PO) settings. Concussion diagnoses in rural and remote areas occurred in emergency department (ED) settings more often than in metro centres or urban areas (76%/75% vs. 52%/60%). Proportion of concussion diagnoses was positively related to SES and age. Diagnosis and point of care varied geographically. The shift in care to PO settings, increased incidence of all diagnoses, and the higher use of the ED by some segments of the population all have important implications for appropriate clinical management and the efficient provision of health care for pediatric concussion. This is the first study to use EOC to describe longitudinal trends in incidence and follow-up care for pediatric concussion in relation to age, sex, rurality, point of care, and area-based SES.

"36076111","Home language and literacy environment and its relationship to socioeconomic status and white matter structure in infancy.","Ted K Turesky, Joseph Sanfilippo, Jennifer Zuk, Banu Ahtam, Borjan Gagoski, Ally Lee, Kathryn Garrisi, Jade Dunstan, Clarisa Carruthers,  ..., Nadine Gaab","The home language and literacy environment (HLLE) in infancy has been associated with subsequent pre-literacy skill development and HLLE at preschool-age has been shown to correlate with white matter organization in tracts that subserve pre-reading and reading skills. Furthermore, childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been linked with both HLLE and white matter organization. It is important to understand whether the relationships between environmental factors such as HLLE and SES and white matter organization can be detected as early as infancy, as this period is characterized by rapid brain development that may make white matter pathways particularly susceptible to these early experiences. Here, we hypothesized that HLLE&#xa0;(1) relates to white matter organization in pre-reading and reading-related tracts in infants, and (2) mediates a link between SES and white matter organization. To test these hypotheses, infants (mean age: 8.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.3&#xa0;months, N&#x2009;=&#x2009;38) underwent diffusion-weighted imaging MRI during natural sleep. Image processing was performed with an infant-specific&#xa0;pipeline and&#xa0;fractional anisotropy (FA) was estimated from the arcuate fasciculus (AF) and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) bilaterally using the&#xa0;baby automated fiber quantification method. HLLE was measured with the Reading subscale of the StimQ (StimQ-Reading) and SES was measured with years of maternal education. Self-reported maternal reading ability was also quantified and applied to our statistical models as a proxy for confounding genetic effects. StimQ-Reading positively correlated with FA in left AF and to maternal education, but did not mediate the relationship between them. Taken together, these findings underscore the importance of considering HLLE from the start of life and may inform novel prevention and intervention strategies to support developing infants during a period of heightened brain plasticity.",2022,11,1,"Brain structure &amp; function","10.1007/s00429-022-02560-4","PMC9922094","Brain Struct Funct","eng","D007223; D006801; D002675; D002648; D066127; D007802; D000067010; D011932; D012923; D001921","Infant; Humans; Child, Preschool; Child; White Matter; Language; Literacy; Reading; Social Class; Brain","R01 HD065762; 5UL1RR025758; Transitions Award","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.02.085; 10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00336-7; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.10.019; 10.1111/desc.12344; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.024; 10.1016/j.dcn.2016.03.004; 10.3389/fnins.2014.00276; 10.3102/00346543065001001; 10.1016/B978-0-12-802381-5.00049-X; 10.1002/ana.20319; 10.1016/S0885-2006(99)80054-4; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.06.039; 10.1111/desc.12764; 10.1016/j.neuron.2017.08.034; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2005.01.006; 10.1007/s10519-009-9263-2.Heritability; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02213.x; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.03.057; 10.1037/0022-0663.100.3.566; 10.1038/s41467-022-28326-4; 10.1016/j.neuron.2022.04.018; 10.1016/j.dcn.2015.05.002; 10.1111/desc.12428; 10.1371/journal.pone.0018712; 10.1038/s41539-020-00079-z; 10.1073/pnas.1008950108; 10.1111/1467-8624.00612; 10.1542/peds.2015-0359; 10.1016/j.jpeds.2017.08.037; 10.3389/fnhum.2021.672665; 10.1371/journal.pone.0042486; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.07.061; 10.1016/j.appdev.2004.12.003; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0779-20.2020; 10.1093/cercor/bhv281; 10.1111/desc.12096.Associations; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.12.097; 10.1177/002221940003300306; 10.1016/j.jecp.2005.07.003; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.3139; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2014.04.010; 10.1038/s41586-022-04492-9; 10.1080/15374416.2017.1326122; 10.1016/j.appdev.2019.101053; 10.1002/hbm.1058; 10.1038/nn.3983; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2012.01147.x; 10.1007/s11881-021-00250-0; 10.1002/hbm.24407; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.10.060; 10.1007/s11881-016-0134-2; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2012.06457.x; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.04.004; 10.1523/jneurosci.0484-18.2018; 10.1542/peds.2019-3046; 10.1177/027112149201200206; 10.1037/0022-0663.96.2.265; 10.1017/S0142716409990191; 10.1002/icd; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116439; 10.3171/2016.2.JNS151592; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.06.005; 10.1038/npp.2009.115; 10.1093/cercor/bhs383; 10.1002/ima.22005; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.07.037; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116137; 10.1016/j.dcn.2020.100893; 10.1109/TMI.2010.2046908; 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00346; 10.1371/journal.pone.0215560; 10.1002/mrm.26059; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.08.016; 10.1146/annurev-psych-120710-100434; 10.1093/cercor/bhw095; 10.1044/2018_LSHSS-17-0063; 10.3171/2015.5JNS15455; 10.1073/pnas.1206792109; 10.1371/journal.pone.0049790; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116946; 10.1111/desc.12983; 10.1016/j.dcn.2021.100973","<b>Conflict of interest</b> The authors have no relevant financial or non-financial interests to disclose.","Harvard Graduate School of Education, Cambridge, MA, USA."

This perspective article offers different perspectives of poverty and its reciprocal association with mental illness and outlines possible future research and policy implications. We will approach the topic of poverty from various levels: On a micro-level, focusing on absolute poverty with precarious housing and malnutrition. On a meso-level, on neighborhood-related poverty as a factor in individuals' mental illness. On a macro-level, on effects of income inequality on mental health. In several studies, it has been shown that on each level, poverty has a profound impact on mental health, though it must be noted that in some fields, research is still scarce. In the future, an inter- and transdisciplinary approach is of considerable importance, since poverty and its impact on mental health should be addressed from different perspectives, reaching from targeted programs for individual groups (e.g., homeless people) up to national policy measures.",2022,1,1,"Frontiers in public health","10.3389/fpubh.2022.975482","PMC9386343","Front Public Health","eng","D006798; D006801; D007182; D001523; D008603; D011203","Housing; Humans; Income; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Poverty",NA,"10.1126/science.aay0214; 10.35188/UNU-WIDER/2020/800-9; 10.1787/0fe1315d-en; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1003750; 10.1371/journal.pmed.0050225; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2013.02.018; 10.1097/YCO.0000000000000715; 10.1192/bjb.2020.49; 10.1007/s00115-020-01013-9; 10.3389/fpubh.2021.722290; 10.1186/s12889-021-10631-0; 10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30752-2; 10.1192/bjp.bp.112.116178; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2009.01438.x; 10.1093/schbul/sbs096; 10.3238/arztebl.2017.0121; 10.1007/s00103-020-03185-w; 10.1002/wps.20056; 10.1016/j.annepidem.2006.07.008; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113542; 10.1007/978-94-007-2309-2_1; 10.1002/wps.20221; 10.1017/S0033291713003255; 10.1017/S0033291719001235; 10.1093/eurpub/ckv120; 10.1007/s00127-012-0506-9; 10.1093/hsw/hlt013; 10.1016/j.puhe.2006.10.005; 10.1192/bjp.bp.109.072066; 10.1136/jech.2004.029678; 10.1016/S2215-0366(17)30206-7; 10.1002/wps.20492; 10.1371/journal.pone.0154196; 10.1136/jech.2006.046631; 10.1146/annurev-soc-070308-115926; 10.1007/s00127-021-02159-w; 10.1177/0020764013481426; 10.1016/S0277-9536(02)00408-2; 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049220; 10.1093/ije/dyab066; 10.1542/peds.2014-3549E; 10.1007/s11205-016-1283-8; 10.1093/esr/jcu057; 10.1136/bmj.329.7462.408; 10.1111/j.1740-9713.2004.00058.x; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.3009; 10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00508; 10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-070954; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114374; 10.1177/0956797615596713; 10.1186/s12961-020-0528-9; 10.1111/adb.12866; 10.1038/nn.4108","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

This study examined how two measures of psychosocial stress, perceived stress and domain-specific stress, covary with the acute neurobiological stress response. The Richmond Stress and Sugar Study includes a racially and socioeconomically diverse cohort of adults at risk for type 2 diabetes ( n = 125; mean age = 57 years, 48% Black, and 61% high neighborhood socioeconomic status [SES]). Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity was assessed by salivary cortisol response to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a laboratory stressor. Higher perceived stress was associated with a lower cortisol response to the TSST (-7.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -13.1% to -1.5%) but was not associated with cortisol recovery after the TSST (3%; 95% CI = -0.6% to 6.8%). In contrast, domain-specific stress was not associated with cortisol response (-2.1%; 95% CI = -20.7% to 20.9%) but was inversely associated with cortisol recovery (3.7%; 95% CI = 0.6% to 7.0%). SES modified these associations: both perceived stress and domain-specific stress were associated with TSST cortisol response only among participants from high-SES neighborhoods. There was minimal evidence of effect modification by race. Both self-report measures of psychosocial stress were associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity to an acute stressor. These associations varied by perceived versus domain-specific measurement scales and by neighborhood SES.

Study 2 (N = 168) included an independent sample of children under age 7. A predictive model from Study 1 was applied to Study 2. The latent class analyses in Study 1 indicated preference of a 3-class solution (BIC = 3807.70, p &lt; 0.001). Maternal education, income-to-needs ratio, and family history of psychopathology, defined class membership more strongly than child factors.

However, evidence has been limited and mixed, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Extend a previous study reporting significant associations between food patterns and behavioral disinhibition and explore whether low-grade inflammation is linked to behaviors and mediates the association between diet and behavioral disinhibition. Among participants of the UK Biobank (UKB) we extracted a single behavioral disinhibition principal component using the UKB touchscreen questionnaire, Mental Health Questionnaire (MHQ), and registered diagnoses. We identified four dietary patterns (prudent diet, elimination of wheat/dairy/eggs, meat-based diet, full-cream dairy consumption) by using the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Immune biomarkers and an aggregated inflammation score (INFLA-score) were used to characterize low-grade inflammation. Associations between dietary patterns and immune biomarkers, between immune biomarkers and disinhibition were assessed, with adjustment for demographics, lifestyle factors, and somatic health conditions. Next, mediation analyses were run to examine whether the association between dietary patterns and disinhibition was partially explained by inflammatory levels. We also conducted subgroup analyses to explore whether associations and the mediation effect differed by sex, age, ethnicity/race, body-mass-index (BMI), and socioeconomic status (SES). The prudent diet was negatively, and the meat-based diet was positively associated with several pro-inflammatory biomarkers. Most immune biomarkers were positively associated with disinhibition (numbers of lymphocytes (&#x3b2;<sub>standardized</sub>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.082, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), monocytes (&#x3b2;<sub>standardized</sub>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.043, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), neutrophils (&#x3b2;<sub>standardized</sub>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.071, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), platelets (&#x3b2;<sub>standardized</sub>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.022, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), leukocytes (&#x3b2;<sub>standardized</sub>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.093, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), C-reactive protein (&#x3b2;<sub>standardized</sub>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.051, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), and for INFLA-score (&#x3b2;<sub>standardized</sub>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.074, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). In the mediation model, the INFLA-score mediated the association between prudent diet and meat-based diet and disinhibition score, with a significant indirect effect of low-grade inflammation for the prudent diet-disinhibition association (&#x3b2;<sub>standardized</sub>&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.007, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and for meat-disinhibition association (&#x3b2;<sub>standardized</sub>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001)). Although all effects were small, covariates and interaction term adjustments did not attenuate the effects, and neither did most subgroup-only analyses. The prudent diet was associated with a lower disinhibition score and this effect was partially mediated by the lower inflammation. Reversely, the meat-based diet was linked to more inflammation, which was associated with more disinhibition. Our findings suggest mediating effects of immune function in the relationship between diet and behavioral disinhibition.

However, spontaneous epileptic seizures (SES) and their associated electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities have not been reported in WAR kindled animals. The same is true for na&#xef;ve WARs (without sound-induced seizures). An approach to increment epileptogenesis and SES is to use a second insult to be added to the genetic background. Here, we used adult na&#xef;ve WARs with microgyria induced by neonatal cortical freeze-lesion (FL) to evaluate the occurrence of SES and the modification in cortical oscillation patterns and behavior. The neonatal cortical FL was performed in Wistar and na&#xef;ve WARs (Wis-FL and WAR-FL). Sham animals were used as controls (Wistar-S and WAR-S). Video-EEG recordings and behavioral tasks were performed during adulthood. Surprisingly, spike-waive discharges (SWD) events associated with behavior arrest were detected in WAR-S rats. Those events increased in duration and number in WAR-FL animals. The EEG quantitative analysis showed decreased power of cortical delta, theta and beta oscillations in WAR-S, decreased power of cortical fast gamma (FG) oscillations in WARs, independent of microgyria, and decreased interhemispheric synchrony for delta and FG with stronger coupling in delta and theta-FG oscillations in FL animals. The WARs, regardless of microgyria, had reduced locomotor activity, but only WAR-FL animals had reduced anxiety-like behavior. Microgyria in na&#xef;ve WARs intensified SWD events associated with behavior arrest that could reflect absence-like seizures and abnormal cortical oscillations, and reduced anxiety-like behavior indicating that WAR-FL could be a reliable model to study epileptogenesis.",2022,9,15,"Neuroscience","10.1016/j.neuroscience.2022.07.032",NA,"Neuroscience","eng","D000161; D000818; D001007; D004195; D004569; D004832; D051381; D017208; D012640","Acoustic Stimulation; Animals; Anxiety; Disease Models, Animal; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy, Absence; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Seizures",NA,"NA","Declaration of competing Interest All authors declare no competing financial interests.","Neurophysiology and Neurochemistry of Neuronal Excitability and Synaptic Plasticity Laboratory (NNNESP Lab.), Department of Biochemistry, ICBS, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre 90035-003, RS, Brazil; Graduate Program in Neuroscience, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre 90035-003, RS, Brazil; Graduate Program in Biological Science: Biochemistry, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre 90035-003, RS, Brazil."

Although early nutrition (e.g., breastfeeding) is positively correlated with IQ in children born VLBW, the association between dietary intake in childhood and cognitive performance is unknown. Thus, our study is the first to investigate the relationship between diet quality, as measured by the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) and cognitive performance in a Canadian cohort of 5-year-old children born VLBW (<i>n</i> = 158; 47% female). Diet quality was measured using two 24-h diet recalls obtained from parents and cognitive performance was assessed using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-IV (WPPSI-IV). To account for additional sociodemographic factors that could influence neurodevelopment, linear regression analyses were adjusted for sex, household income above/below the poverty line, maternal education, birth weight and breastfeeding duration. Mean &#xb1; SD HEI-2010 score was 58.2 &#xb1; 12.4, with most children (67%) having diets in ""need of improvement"" (scores 51-80). HEI-2010 scores were not significantly associated with IQ or any other WPPSI-IV composite score. Significant predictors of IQ in our model were birth weight, sex, and maternal education. Our findings emphasize the important role of maternal education and other sociodemographic factors on neurodevelopment in children born VLBW. Further, despite not finding any significant association between HEI-2010 scores and IQ, our results highlight the need to improve diet quality in young children born VLBW.

By rational engineering of the transcription factor SOX2, a key promoter of GBM malignancy, together with the Kruppel-associated box and DNA methyltransferase3A/L catalytic domains, we generated a synthetic repressor named SOX2 epigenetic silencer (SES), which induces the transcriptional silencing of its original targets. By doing so, SES kills both glioma cell lines and patient-derived cancer stem cells in vitro and in vivo. SES expression, through local viral delivery in mouse xenografts, induces strong regression of human tumors and survival rescue. Conversely, SES is not harmful to neurons and glia, also thanks to a minimal promoter that restricts its expression in mitotically active cells, rarely present in the brain parenchyma.

In Budongo Forest, Uganda, for example, local communities commonly engage in snare trap (hereafter: snare) setting for wild meat. This illegal activity posits a substantial threat to wild chimpanzees, causing permanent wounds or death for those who are snared. Despite various schemes previously implemented to address snare setting-an activity that is fueled by poverty, the problem and its detrimental impact on chimpanzees persists. Here, we experimentally tested a novel intervention, a systematic display of specially designed warning signs aimed at local poachers. We monitored the presence of snares before and after introducing these signs over a total period of two years and compared it with that of a similar sized control area with no intervention.

"35906663","An intervention to reduce stigma and improve management of depression, risk of suicide/self-harm and other significant emotional or medically unexplained complaints among adolescents living in urban slums: protocol for the ARTEMIS project.","Sandhya Kanaka Yatirajula, Sudha Kallakuri, Srilatha Paslawar, Ankita Mukherjee, Amritendu Bhattacharya, Susmita Chatterjee, Rajesh Sagar, Ashok Kumar, Heidi Lempp,  ..., Pallab K Maulik","There are around 250 million adolescents in India. Adolescents are vulnerable to common mental disorders with depression and self-harm accounting for a major share of the burden of death and disability in this age group. Around 20% of children and adolescents are diagnosed with/ or live with a disabling mental illness. A national survey has found that suicide is the third leading cause of death among adolescents in India. The authors hypothesise that an intervention involving an anti-stigma campaign co-created by adolescents themselves, and a mobile technology-based electronic decision support system will help reduce stigma, depression, and suicide risk and improve mental health for high-risk adolescents living in urban slums in India. The intervention will be implemented as a cluster randomised control trial in 30 slum clusters in each of the cities of Vijayawada and New Delhi in India. Adolescents aged 10 to 19 years will be screened for depression and suicide ideation using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Two evaluation cohorts will be derived-a high-risk cohort with an elevated PHQ-9 score &#x2265; 10 and/or a positive response (score &#x2265; 2) to the suicide risk question on the PHQ-9, and a non-high-risk cohort comprising an equal number of adolescents not at elevated risk based on these scores. The key elements that ARTEMIS will focus on are increasing awareness among adolescents and the slum community on these mental health conditions as well as strengthening the skills of existing primary healthcare workers and promoting task sharing. The findings from this study will provide evidence to governments about strategies with potential for addressing the gaps in providing care for adolescents living in urban slums and experiencing depression, other significant emotional or medically unexplained complaints or increased suicide risk/self-harm and should have relevance not only for India but also for other low- and middle-income countries.

Administrative national data from all 290 Swedish municipalities were used to determine the prevalence of DP and socioeconomic disadvantage [poverty, long-term unemployment, income inequality (GINI Index) and income inequality between women and men]. Geospatial cold spots (clusters of municipalities with a DP/socioeconomic disadvantage prevalence lower than the nationwide prevalence) and hot spots (clusters of municipalities with a DP/socioeconomic disadvantage higher than the nationwide prevalence) were identified, and whether a hot spot was overlapping with another hot spot and a cold spot overlapping with another cold spot were analysed using the Getis-Ord Gi statistics. Among women and men, cold spots of DP were most consistently located in the Stockholm area. Hot spots of DP were found in the mid-south Sweden, characterized by mid-sized urban centres in rural territories. High DP rate and socioeconomic disadvantage were overlapping, except for income inequality. Clusters of gender income inequality and women's high DP rate were observed in mid-south Sweden. DP and socioeconomic disadvantage are not randomly distributed in Sweden.

"35900870","Introduction to the Special Focus: The Affective Neuroscience of Poverty.","Robin Nusslock, Martha J Farah","Growing up in poverty is associated with a heightened risk for mental and physical health problems across the life span, and there is a growing recognition of the role that social determinants of health play in driving these outcomes and inequities. How do the social conditions of poverty get under the skin to influence biology, and through what mechanisms do the stressors of poverty generate risk for a broad range of health problems? The growing field examining the neuroscience of socioeconomic status (SES) proposes that the brain is an entry point or pathway through which poverty and adversity become embedded in biology to generate these disparities. To date, however, the majority of research on the neuroscience of SES has focused on cognitive or executive control processes. However, the relationship between SES and brain systems involved in affective or emotional processes may be especially important for understanding social determinants of health. Accordingly, this Special Focus on The Affective Neuroscience of Poverty invited contributions from authors examining the relationship between SES and brain systems involved in generating and regulating emotions. In this editorial introduction, we (a) provide an overview of the neuroscience of SES; (b) introduce each of the articles in this Special Focus; and (c) discuss the scientific, treatment, and policy implications of studying the affective neuroscience of poverty.",2022,9,1,"Journal of cognitive neuroscience","10.1162/jocn_a_01899",NA,"J Cogn Neurosci","eng","D001921; D056344; D006801; D009488; D011203; D012923","Brain; Executive Function; Humans; Neurosciences; Poverty; Social Class","R01 MH123473; P50 DA051361","NA",NA,"University of Pennsylvania."
"35900864","Anger, Fear, and Sadness: Relations to Socioeconomic Status and the Amygdala.","Yu Hao, Maxwell Bertolero, Martha J Farah","Here, we test three often proposed hypotheses about socioeconomic status (SES), affect, and the brain, for which evidence is mixed or lacking. The first hypothesis, that negative affect is more common at lower levels of SES, has ample evidence from studies of psychiatric symptoms but is tested for the first time here across multiple measures of negative emotions in healthy young adults. The second hypothesis is actually a set of hypotheses, that SES is associated with three structural and functional properties of the amygdala. Third, and most important for the affective neuroscience of SES, is the hypothesis that SES differences in the amygdala are responsible for the affective differences. Despite the intuitive appeal of this hypothesis, it has rarely been tested and has never been confirmed. Here, we review the literature for evidence on each of these hypotheses and find in a number of cases that the evidence is weak or nonexistant. We then subject each hypothesis to a new empirical test with a large sample of healthy young adults. We confirm that negative affect is more common at lower levels of SES and we find a positive relation between SES and amygdala volume. However, evidence is weak on the relation of SES to functional properties of amygdala. Finally, the tendency toward negative affect in lower SES individuals cannot be accounted for by the structural or functional characteristics of the amygdala measured here.",2022,9,1,"Journal of cognitive neuroscience","10.1162/jocn_a_01892",NA,"J Cogn Neurosci","eng","D000679; D000786; D005239; D006801; D000078602; D012923; D055815","Amygdala; Anger; Fear; Humans; Sadness; Social Class; Young Adult",NA,"NA",NA,"University of Pennsylvania."

Planning for hearing rehabilitation must accompany strategies for infection control when surgically managing patients with chronic otitis media. Several barriers prevent adequate hearing restoration in such a heterogeneous patient population. A lack of standardized reporting of surgical interventions, hearing, and quality of life outcomes impedes meta-analyses of existing data and the generation of high- quality evidence, including cost-effectiveness data, through prospective studies. This, in turn, prevents the ability of clinicians to stratify patients based on prognostic indicators, which could guide the decision-making pathway. Strategies to improve reporting standards and methods have the potential to classify patients with chronic otitis media preoperatively, which could guide decision-making for hearing restoration with ossicu- loplasty versus prosthetic hearing devices. Appropriately selected clinical guidelines would not only foster directed research but could enhance patient-centered and evidence-based decision-making regarding hearing rehabilitation in the surgical planning process.",2022,7,1,"The journal of international advanced otology","10.5152/iao.2022.21428","PMC9404322","J Int Adv Otol","eng","D002908; D006309; D006801; D010033; D011446; D011788; D012106","Chronic Disease; Hearing; Humans; Otitis Media; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Research",NA,"10.1002/lary.22506); 10.1177/0194599813479772); 10.1097/AUD.0000000000000118); 10.19082/3823); 10.1002/lio2.576); 10.1177/0194599812458401); 10.1177/0194599817707719); 10.1007/s00405-018-5100-7); 10.1016/j.maturitas.2018.03.004); 10.1097/01.psy.0000133328.03596.fb); 10.1080/14643154.2017.1344366); 10.1016/j.maturitas.2016.03.008); 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61143-4); 10.1007/s00431-016-2779-6); 10.1093/gerona/glu207); 10.1016/j.maturitas.2012.03.010); 10.1177/0898264309347821); 10.1016/j.maturitas.2011.05.006); 10.1136/bmj.k2219); 10.3310/hta13440); 10.1159/000443629); 10.1002/lary.21167); 10.1177/0003489405114s1201); 10.12669/pjms.303.4742); 10.1002/14651858.CD012023.pub2); 10.1097/MAO.0000000000000225); 10.1097/MAO.0b013e31828daeca); 10.1016/j.anl.2013.04.004); 10.4081/audiores.2013.e2); 10.1097/00005537-200404000-00006); 10.1017/s0022215100136254); 10.1001/archotol.131.4.321); 10.1017/S0022215100136242); 10.1177/2331216519858303); 10.1155/2018/5264124); 10.1159/000323728); 10.1016/j.ijporl.2008.06.009); 10.1177/0194599811415823a294); 10.1001/jamaoto.2020.0998); 10.1016/j.heares.2016.01.016); 10.1097/MAO.0000000000002026); 10.1001/archotol.129.3.297); 10.1001/jamaoto.2019.3221); 10.1097/MOO.0000000000000451); 10.2165/00148365-200403020-00006); 10.1001/archotol.130.4.394); 10.1080/000164800454233); 10.1007/s00405-006-0240-6); 10.1111/j.1365-2273.2004.00947.x); 10.1288/00005537-195608000-00008); 10.5152/iao.2018.5570); 10.5152/iao.2018.5553); 10.1097/00005537-200110000-00026); 10.1016/j.otohns.2008.05.623); 10.18689/mjol-1000103); 10.3126/jngmc.v13i2.16533); 10.4103/0971-7749.108161); 10.1186/1477-7525-1-54); 10.1097/00005537-200003002-00009); 10.1002/lary.25657); 10.1016/j.ijporl.2008.10.030); 10.1097/MAO.0000000000001366)",NA,"Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Donders Centre for Neurosciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands; Department of Otorhinolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; Research School of Behavioral and Cognitive Neurosciences, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands."

Although heightened cortisol concentrations are often hypothesized as an underlying mechanism, evidence supporting this mechanism is not consistent, potentially because of methodological issues and low stress in the population. To address these issues, this preregistered study investigated the following associations between: 1) prenatal psychological stress and hair cortisol, as a biomarker for chronic stress, during the COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., as a major worldwide psychological stressor), and 2) maternal hair cortisol during the COVID-19 outbreak and later infant temperamental negative affectivity and orienting/regulation. Additionally, we explored whether associations were different for women with low versus high socioeconomic status (SES; maternal education and annual household income) and at different stages of pregnancy. Pregnant women (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;100) filled out online questionnaires during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Six months later, when most mothers were still pregnant or had just given birth, maternal hair samples were collected during home visits. When infants were six months old, mothers reported on their infant's temperament. Although hierarchical regression analyses revealed no associations between prenatal COVID-19 psychological stress and hair cortisol during the COVID-19 outbreak, SES proved to be a moderator in this association.

However, few studies have evaluated whether preclinical Alzheimer's disease biomarkers predict Alzheimer's neuropathology at autopsy. We sought to determine whether amyloid PET imaging or CSF biomarkers accurately predict cognitive outcomes and Alzheimer's disease neuropathological findings. This study included 720 participants, 42-91 years of age, who were enrolled in longitudinal studies of memory and aging in the Washington University Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center and were cognitively normal at baseline, underwent amyloid PET imaging and/or CSF collection within 1 year of baseline clinical assessment, and had subsequent clinical follow-up. Cognitive status was assessed longitudinally by Clinical Dementia Rating&#xae;. Biomarker status was assessed using predefined cut-offs for amyloid PET imaging or CSF p-tau181/amyloid-&#x3b2;42. Subsequently, 57 participants died and underwent neuropathologic examination. Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes were assessed using standard criteria. We assessed the predictive value of Alzheimer's disease biomarker status on progression to cognitive impairment and for presence of Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes. Among cognitively normal participants with positive biomarkers, 34.4% developed cognitive impairment (Clinical Dementia Rating &gt; 0) as compared to 8.4% of those with negative biomarkers. Cox proportional hazards modelling indicated that preclinical Alzheimer's disease biomarker status, APOE &#x25b;4 carrier status, polygenic risk score and centred age influenced risk of developing cognitive impairment. Among autopsied participants, 90.9% of biomarker-positive participants and 8.6% of biomarker-negative participants had Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes. Sensitivity was 87.0%, specificity 94.1%, positive predictive value 90.9% and negative predictive value 91.4% for detection of Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes by preclinical biomarkers. Single CSF and amyloid PET baseline biomarkers were also predictive of Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes, as well as Thal phase and Braak stage of pathology at autopsy. Biomarker-negative participants who developed cognitive impairment were more likely to exhibit non-Alzheimer's disease pathology at autopsy. The detection of preclinical Alzheimer's disease biomarkers is strongly predictive of future cognitive impairment and accurately predicts presence of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology at autopsy.",2022,12,19,"Brain : a journal of neurology","10.1093/brain/awac250","PMC10200309","Brain","eng","D006801; D000544; D016229; D060825; D049268; D000682; D015415; D058227; D003071; D016875; D018450","Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognitive Dysfunction; Positron-Emission Tomography; Amyloid; Biomarkers; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Cognition; tau Proteins; Disease Progression","P30 AG066444; K01 AG053474; P01 AG026276; S10 OD025214; AACSF-18-564776; UL1 TR002345; K08 AG068611; P01 AG003991","NA","J.M.L., D.W.C., C.X., S.E.S., R.J.P., B.A.G., T.L.B., E.G., O.H. and C.C. report no competing interests.

Core traits can range from subtle to severe and fluctuate depending on context. Individuals can present for diagnostic assessments during childhood or adulthood. However, waiting times for assessment are typically lengthy, and many individuals wait months or even years to be seen. Traditionally, there has been a lack of standardization between services regarding how many and which multidisciplinary health professionals are involved in the assessment and the methods (diagnostic tools) that are used. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected routine service provision because of stay-at-home mandates and social distancing guidelines. Autism diagnostic services have had to adapt, such as by switching from conducting assessments in person to doing these fully via telehealth (defined as the use of remote technologies for the provision of health care) or using blended in-person or telehealth methods. This study explored health professionals' experiences of and perspectives about conducting telehealth autism diagnostic assessments, including barriers and facilitators to this, during the COVID-19 pandemic; potential telehealth training and supervision needs of health professionals; how the quality and effectiveness of telehealth autism diagnostic services can be enhanced; and experiences of delivering postdiagnostic support remotely. A total of 45 health professionals, working in varied settings across England, participated in one-off, in-depth semistructured qualitative interviews. These were conducted via videoconferencing or telephone. Altogether, participants represented 7 professional disciplines (psychiatry, medicine, psychology, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, nursing, and social work). The data were then analyzed thematically. Thematic analysis indicated the following 7 themes: practicalities of telehealth, telehealth autism diagnostic assessments, diagnostic conclusions, clinical considerations, postdiagnostic support, future ways of working, and health professionals' experiences and needs. Overall, telehealth autism diagnostic assessments were deemed by many participants to be convenient, flexible, and efficient for some patients, families, and health professionals. However, not all patients could be assessed in this way, for example, because of digital poverty, complex clinical presentation, or concerns about risk and safeguarding. Working remotely encouraged innovation, including the development of novel assessment measures. However, some participants expressed significant concerns about the validity and reliability of remotely assessing social communication conditions. A shift to telehealth meant that autism diagnostic services remained operational during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this method of working has potentially affected the parity of service, with people presenting with clinical complexity having to potentially wait longer to be seen or given a diagnostic opinion. There is also a lack of standardization in the provision of services. Further research should identify evidence-based ways of enhancing the timeliness, accessibility, and robustness of the autism diagnostic pathway, as well as the validity and reliability of telehealth methods.",2022,7,20,"JMIR mental health","10.2196/37901","PMC9302612","JMIR Ment Health","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.0054; 10.1007/s10803-016-2886-2; 10.1016/S2215-0366(15)00277-1; 10.1186/s12888-018-1800-1; 10.1177/13623613211015757; 10.1177/1362361316685879?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed; 10.1177/1362361316685879; 10.1111/j.1475-3588.2012.00664.x; 10.1186/s12889-020-09301-4; 10.1007/s10803-021-04950-9; 10.1016/j.rasd.2021.101859; 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.789449; 10.1371/journal.pone.0249237; 10.1007/s10803-022-05435-z; 10.1371/journal.pone.0236415; 10.1007/s10567-021-00358-0; 10.1002/aur.2591; 10.1007/s10803-021-05112-7; 10.1007/s10803-021-04960-7; 10.1007/s10803-021-05395-w; 10.1093/intqhc/mzm042; 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; 10.1177/1468794112468475; 10.1007/BF02172145; 10.3390/ijerph182211812; 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02201; 10.1177/1476718X211052789; 10.1177/1476718x211052789; 10.1111/camh.12545; 10.2196/33819; 10.1136/emermed-2020-210896; 10.2196/24021; 10.1016/j.rasd.2021.101747","Conflicts of Interest: None declared.","Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."

Addressing stigmatization requires adequate measurement. Our systematic review synthesizes the content of scales used with children and adolescents in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) across stigmas, and examines their comparability and level of cultural adaptation. Ten databases were systematically searched combining three sets of search terms: (i) stigma, (ii) scales, and (iii) LMICs. Studies conducted in LMICs, with a sample with mean age below 18 and reporting a minimum of one stigma scale, were eligible. We allocated scale items to four frameworks: (i) dimensions, or drivers of stigmatization; (ii) target variants, or types of stigmatization; (iii) socio-ecological levels, and (iv) cross-cultural equivalence, or scale adaptation to context/population. Based on percentages, we compared scale content per age cohort, stigma status, region, and stigma category. Out of 14,348 records, we included 93 articles (112 scales). Most studies focused on adolescents (12-18 years). Twelve scales were used more than once, seven were used across regions, and four were employed for multiple stigmas. Physical health stigma, and HIV/AIDS-related stigma in particular, was measured most; mental health and multiple/generic stigmas least. Physical and mental health scales were generally more comprehensive, i.e., measuring more stigma facets. In general, scales consistently measured two of the 21 included stigma facets, namely the disruptiveness dimension and the community level. Cross-cultural equivalence was moderate; conceptual and measurement equivalence were high. Although scales were largely comparable in how they measure stigma, they failed to reflect the complexity of the stigmatization process and fell short of existing stigma frameworks and qualitative research. Stigma research with children should work towards cross-culturally validated stigma scale sets which incorporate more facets of existing stigma frameworks, thus facilitating comparability across cultural contexts and informing intervention development and evaluation.",2022,8,1,"Social science &amp; medicine (1982)","10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115121",NA,"Soc Sci Med","eng","D000163; D000293; D002648; D003906; D006801; D011203; D057545; D013240","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Adolescent; Child; Developing Countries; Humans; Poverty; Social Stigma; Stereotyping","R01 MH120649","NA",NA,"Vrije Universiteit, Faculty of Science, Athena Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."

Notably, there is limited data regarding the influence of social determinants of health, like perceived discrimination and economic stress, that may exacerbate COVID-19 health risks. Here, 1,584 recovered COVID-19 patients that experienced mild to severe forms of disease provided detailed medical and psychosocial information. Path analyses examined hypothesized associations between discrimination, illness severity, and lasting symptoms. Secondary analyses evaluated sex differences, timing of infection, and impact of prior mental health problems. Post hoc logistic regressions tested social determinants hypothesized to predict neurological, cognitive, or mood symptoms. 70.6% of patients reported presence of one or more lasting symptom after recovery. 19.4% and 25.1% of patients reported lasting mood or cognitive/memory problems. Perceived discrimination predicted increased illness severity and increased lasting symptom count, even when adjusting for sociodemographic factors and mental/physical health comorbidities. This effect was specific to stress related to discrimination, not to general stress levels. Further, patient perceptions regarding quality of medical care influenced these relationships. Finally, illness early in the pandemic is associated with more severe illness and more frequent lasting complaints. Lasting symptoms after recovery from COVID-19 are highly prevalent and neural systems are significantly impacted. Importantly, psychosocial factors (perceived discrimination and perceived SES) can exacerbate individual health risk. This study provides actionable directions for improved health outcomes by establishing that sociodemographic risk and medical care influence near and long-ranging health outcomes.

Parental SES may also influence brain development, with several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies reporting associations with youth brain morphometry. However, MRI signal intensity metrics have not been assessed, but could offer a microstructural correlate, thereby increasing our understanding of SES influences on neurobiology. We computed a parental SES score from family income, parental education and parental occupation, and assessed relations with cortical microstructure as measured by T1w/T2w ratio (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;504, age&#xa0;=&#xa0;3-21 years). We found negative age-stabile relations between parental SES and T1w/T2w ratio, indicating that youths from lower SES families have higher ratio in widespread frontal, temporal, medial parietal and occipital regions, possibly indicating a more developed cortex. Effect sizes were small, but larger than for conventional morphometric properties i.e. cortical surface area and thickness, which were not significantly associated with parental SES. Youths from lower SES families had poorer language related abilities, but microstructural differences did not mediate these relations.

Most people affected by PD live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and experience large inequalities in access to neurological care and essential medicines. This Special Communication describes 6 actions steps that are urgently needed to address global disparities in PD. The adoption by the 73rd World Health Assembly (WHA) of resolution 73.10 to develop an intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders in consultation with member states was the stimulus to coordinate efforts and leverage momentum to advance the agenda of neurological conditions, such as PD. In April 2021, the Brain Health Unit at the World Health Organization convened a multidisciplinary, sex-balanced, international consultation workshop, which identified 6 workable avenues for action within the domains of disease burden; advocacy and awareness; prevention and risk reduction; diagnosis, treatment, and care; caregiver support; and research. The dramatic increase of PD cases in many world regions and the potential costs of PD-associated treatment will need to be addressed to prevent possible health service strain.

To examine and synthesize the available quantitative evidence of the impact of employment programs on outcomes of CMD. Embase, Econlit, Global Health, MEDLINE, APA PsychINFO, and Social Policy and Practice were searched for experimental and quasi-experimental studies which investigated the impact of employment programs on primary and secondary outcomes of a CMD. A narrative synthesis according to Popay was conducted. The methodological quality of studies was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Assessment Scale. Of the 1,327 studies retrieved, two randomized controlled trials, one retrospective cohort, one pilot study with a non-randomized experimental design, and one randomized field experiment were included in the final review. Employment programs generally included multiple components such as skills-based training, and hands-on placements. Depression and anxiety were the CMDs measured as primary or secondary outcomes within included studies. Findings regarding the impact of employment programs on CMD were mixed with two studies reporting significantly positive effects, two reporting no effects, and one reporting mixed effects. The quality among included studies was good overall with some concerns regarding internal validity. Employment programs may support a decrease in the prevalence, incidence, and severity of CMDs. However, there is high heterogeneity among study effects, designs, and contexts. More research is needed to gain further insight into the nature of this association and the mechanisms of impact.

UNESCO claimed that more than 190 countries had implemented countrywide school closures, which resulted in preventing 1.6 billion students of their classroom learning opportunities. As children are unable to study in the classroom with teachers' supervision, the importance of parental engagement is amplified in children's learning at home. The primary purpose of the present study was to investigate how parental involvement contribute to children's academic achievement during school closure. Two hundred and twenty-nine primary school children and their parents. Children's academic achievement before (T1) and after school closure (T3), parental involvement (T2) and children's learning engagement (T2) during school closure were measured. After controlling for gender, age, grade and SES, children's learning engagement (T2) served as a full mediator of the association between parental involvement (T2) and children's academic achievement from T1 to T3. Moreover, parental psychological control (T2) moderated the association between parental involvement (T2) and children's learning engagement (T2). Specifically, the contribution of parental involvement to children's learning engagement became stronger for children whose parents had higher levels of psychological control. Higher Chinese parental psychological control did not always correlate to lower academic outcomes in the context of COVID-19.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, material hardship (i.e., difficulty paying for basic needs) in families of young children has had detrimental effects on caregivers' and children's well-being. In addition to the degree of material hardship, the week-to-week and month-to-month unpredictability of hardship status may add to families' stress and worsen well-being. This study examined the magnitude of and mechanisms underlying the effects of material hardship level and unpredictability on the well-being of U.S. households with young children during the pandemic. Data were drawn from the RAPID project, a large ongoing national study that used weekly/biweekly online surveys to investigate the pandemic impact on U.S. households with young children. The current study leveraged data from 4621 families who provided at least three responses between April 2020 and October 2021. Findings indicated that racial/ethnic minorities and lower-income households experienced higher levels of material hardship and unpredictability during the pandemic, compared to their White or higher-income counterparts. Levels of pandemic-related material hardship and hardship unpredictability were both significantly associated with worsened well-being among caregivers and children. Finally, the effects of hardship level and unpredictability on well-being outcomes were partially mediated through disrupted family routines. The findings from this study highlight that ensuring equal and adequate access to financial resources, as well as promoting financial stability for households with young children are both critical for maintaining functional family dynamics and promoting caregivers' and children's optimal well-being.",2022,8,1,"Social science &amp; medicine (1982)","10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115173","PMC9242702","Soc Sci Med","eng","D000086382; D002648; D002675; D005191; D006801; D007182; D058873; D011203","COVID-19; Child; Child, Preschool; Family Characteristics; Humans; Income; Pandemics; Poverty","P50 DA048756","NA","None.","Stanford Center on Early Childhood, Graduate School of Education, Stanford University, USA."

We measured biological sensitivity as daily fluctuations in diurnal cortisol slope, and SES as a principal component of family income and maternal education. A robust analysis of 1013 daily assessments revealed that youth from lower SES homes reported greater social difficulties only on days that they exhibited flatter diurnal cortisol slopes, and youth from higher SES homes reported fewer social difficulties on these days. SES was not associated with social difficulties on days that adolescents exhibited steeper, declining diurnal cortisol slopes. Findings support recent theory that risk and resilience are dynamic processes that change within individuals over time.

"35773680","Environmental impacts of mass drug administration programs: exposures, risks, and mitigation of antimicrobial resistance.","Joanna K Konopka, Pranab Chatterjee, Connor LaMontagne, Joe Brown","Mass drug administration (MDA) of antimicrobials has shown promise in the reduction and potential elimination of a variety of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). However, with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) becoming a global crisis, the risks posed by widespread antimicrobial use need to be evaluated. As the role of the environment in AMR emergence and dissemination has become increasingly recognized, it is likewise crucial to establish the role of MDA in environmental AMR pollution, along with the potential impacts of such pollution. This review presents the current state of knowledge on the antimicrobial compounds, resistant organisms, and antimicrobial resistance genes in MDA trials, routes of these determinants into the environment, and their persistence and ecological impacts, particularly in low and middle-income countries where these trials are most common. From the few studies directly evaluating AMR outcomes in azithromycin MDA trials, it is becoming apparent that MDA efforts can increase carriage and excretion of resistant pathogens in a lasting way. However, research on these outcomes for other antimicrobials used in MDA trials is sorely needed.

Exposure to psychosocial risk factors early in life alters the child's social milieu and in turn, could lead to atypical processing of social stimuli. In this study, we used functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure cortical responses to a social discrimination task in children raised in a low-resource setting at 6, 24, and 36 months. In addition, we assessed the relation between cortical responses to social and non-social information with psychosocial risk factors assessed using the Childhood Psychosocial Adversity Scale (CPAS). In line with previous findings, we observed specialization to social stimuli in cortical regions in all age groups. In addition, we found that risk factors were associated with social discrimination at 24 months (intimate partner violence and verbal abuse and family conflict) and 36 months (verbal abuse and family conflict and maternal depression) but not at 6 months. Overall, the results show that exposure to psychosocial adversity has more impact on social information processing in toddlerhood than earlier in infancy.",2022,8,1,"Developmental cognitive neuroscience","10.1016/j.dcn.2022.101125","PMC9241055","Dev Cogn Neurosci","eng","D002648; D003071; D006801; D012307","Child; Cognition; Humans; Risk Factors","MR/S018425/1; P50 HD105351; R01 AI043596","10.1117/1.NPh.8.3.035003; 10.1037/bul0000002; 10.1002/da.22147; 10.1111/j.1467&#x2013;8624.2009.01312.x; 10.1080/17470919.2011.614696; 10.1098/rspb.2012.3026; 10.1111/ejn.13757; 10.1016/S0272&#x2013;7358(98)00100&#x2013;7; 10.1111/jcpp.12413","The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.","Labs of Cognitive Neuroscience, Division of Developmental Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Harvard Graduate School of Education, Cambridge, MA, USA."

However, limited research has examined whether stress responses relate to adolescent substance use, especially among adolescents from ethnic minority and high-adversity backgrounds. The present study assessed whether blunted emotional and cortisol responses to stress at age 14 related to substance use by ages 14 and 16, and whether associations varied by poverty status and sex. A sample of 277 Mexican-origin youth (53.19% female; 68.35% below the poverty line) completed a social-evaluative stress task, which was culturally adapted for this population, and provided saliva samples and rated their anger, sadness, and happiness throughout the task. They also reported whether they had ever used alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes, and vaping of nicotine at age 14 and again at age 16. Multilevel models suggested that blunted cortisol reactivity to stress was associated with alcohol use by age 14 and vaping nicotine by age 16 among youth above the poverty line. Also, blunted sadness and happiness reactivity to stress was associated with use of marijuana and alcohol among female adolescents. Blunted stress responses may be a risk factor for substance use among youth above the poverty line and female adolescents.",2023,8,1,"Development and psychopathology","10.1017/S0954579422000244","PMC9792637","Dev Psychopathol","eng","D006801; D000293; D005260; D008297; D005006; D009538; D006854; D008913; D019966; D013315","Humans; Adolescent; Female; Male; Ethnicity; Nicotine; Hydrocortisone; Minority Groups; Substance-Related Disorders; Stress, Psychological","T32 DA017629; R01 ES017054; P01 ES009605; F31 DA051181; R01 DA035300","10.1046/j.1360-0443.2003.00496.x; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.12.032; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2013.04.002; 10.1007/s10802-017-0311-8; 10.1186/2042-6410-3-14; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2021.105365; 10.2105/AJPH.90.3.407; 10.1016/S0006-3223(03)00705-4; 10.1016/j.cpr.2007.10.001; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2007.05.002; 10.1007/s00213-010-2007-4; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.02.025; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2005.02.010; 10.1016/j.bbi.2017.06.015; 10.1136/jech-2014-204164; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.11.007; 10.2105/AJPH.2003.037051; 10.1176/appi.ajp.157.5.745; 10.1037/0033-2909.130.3.355; 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2020.09.013; 10.5993/AJHB.42.5.8; 10.1542/peds.111.5.949; 10.3109/713610244; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2019.1475; 10.15288/jsad.2016.77.208; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2012.05.031; 10.1371/journal.pone.0061724; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2017.10.009; 10.1046/j.1360-0443.2002.00103.x; 10.1111/psyp.12017; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.02.030; 10.1016/S0899-3289(97)90009-2; 10.1017/S0033291705006045; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2008.08.013; 10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.03.046; 10.1016/S0022-3999(02)00553-6; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2013.05.009; 10.1007/978-3-030-17332-6_3; 10.1007/s10802-008-9291-z; 10.1001/archpedi.160.7.739; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.08.015; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2006.01570.x; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02685.x; 10.1016/j.envres.2021.111908; 10.3791/55393; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2020.104828; 10.3998/2027.42/150621; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.07071050; 10.1037/adb0000217; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2019.05.002; 10.3109/10826084.2015.1058826; 10.15585/mmwr.ss6708a1; 10.1016/j.jbtep.2007.02.003; 10.1159/000119004; 10.1016/j.paid.2016.05.011; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.05030503; 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093548; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.04.028; 10.1159/000333036; 10.1111/add.12980; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.10.267; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2009.04.006; 10.1037/1064-1297.10.3.310; 10.1007/s10964-017-0790-5; 10.1037/a0024244; 10.1037/0022-3514.81.1.146; 10.1177/1073191119885019; 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2005.10.007; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2010.01.006; 10.15288/jsad.2018.79.761; 10.1542/peds.2009-3450; 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2019-055052; 10.1016/j.bbi.2009.08.009; 10.1016/S0006-3223(98)00216-9; 10.1080/15374410902976320; 10.2307/3315184; 10.1097/00004583-200402000-00010; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.06.017; 10.15288/jsad.2012.73.772; 10.1017/S0954579415000875; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2015.07.001; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.07.215; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.07.006; 10.1177/1359105317713359; 10.1007/s10608-015-9729-x; 10.1016/j.brat.2019.103475; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08030412; 10.1016/S1054-139X(03)00350-1; 10.15585/mmwr.mm6440a2; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2011.06.014; 10.1016/j.ntt.2015.08.001; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.05.021; 10.1080/13676261.2012.685707; 10.1111/2041-210X.13434; 10.1111/dar.12260; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.04.017; 10.1002/dev.20336; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2020.105067; 10.1521/pedi.2014.28.1.40; 10.1037/0893-164X.16.1.72; 10.1037/a0016003; 10.1007/s002130100917; 10.1017/S0954579409000066; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2006.01.006; 10.1016/j.neuro.2016.07.010; 10.1073/pnas.0409174102; 10.1093/alcalc/agx027; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02246.x; 10.1136/jech-2016-208503; 10.1111/ajad.12530; 10.1177/1077559513520466; 10.1007/s10578-018-0784-x; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03448.x; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2004.06.009; 10.1016/j.ynstr.2019.100148; 10.1037/0893-164X.18.2.122; 10.1038/s41398-019-0406-9; 10.1111/adb.12135; 10.3390/brainsci9040076; 10.1177/0165025413515405","Conflicts of Interest: None","Center for Environmental Research and Children's Health, Berkeley School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA."
"35755206","Exploring the relationship of sleep, cognition, and cortisol in sickle cell disease.","Melanie K&#xf6;lbel, Fenella J Kirkham, Ray K Iles, Hanne Stotesbury, Elizabeth Halstead, Celia Brenchley, Sati Sahota, Dagmara Dimitriou","Neurocognitive impairment is common in people with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and evidence is accumulating that sleep disturbances play a role. The interaction between cortisol and sleep in the general population is associated with cognition as well as general wellbeing but there are few data in SCD. We aimed to understand the relationship between cortisol and sleep in individuals with SCD and explored associations with cognition. Forty-five participants of black heritage (SCD: N&#xa0;=&#xa0;27, 9-29 years, 16 females; Controls: N&#xa0;=&#xa0;18, 11-25 years, 13 females) were recruited from the community between 2018 - 2020. Participants completed standardized questionnaires about their sleep behaviour and wore actigraphy MotionWatch8 for 7 nights to assess nocturnal sleep patterns. Salivary cortisol samples were taken on wakening and 3 times after 14:00. Cognition was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for children and adults. People with SCD took longer to fall asleep and experienced greater wake bouts, mobile minutes and fragmented sleep compared to controls. Although non-significant, people with SCD experienced lower morning cortisol, with a flattened diurnal cortisol ratio compared to controls. Interestingly, SCD participants, but not controls, with low diurnal variation scored lowest on processing speed (PSI) and perceptual reasoning index (PRI). A moderator analysis revealed that the effect of morning cortisol and diurnal cortisol ratio on PRI by group health (i.e., SCD and healthy controls) depended on sleep quality.

Its development and maintenance are related to the interplay of biological, psychological, and contextual factors. Among the contextual factors, sociodemographic aspects are poorly elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the relationships between sociodemographic/clinical factors and symptom severity measures using a web-based registry of patients with FM. Adult patients with an ACR 2010/2011 diagnosis of FM underwent a clinical evaluation and were asked to complete questionnaires covering their sociodemographic data (gender, age, marital status, educational level), and disease-specific measures (the revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR), and the Polysymptomatic Distress Scale (PDS)). Data relating to 3,221 patients (3001 women and 220 men) was collected. The ANOVA showed significant difference in mean FIQR scores when the five marital conditions (cohabiter, married, separated/divorced, single, widowed) were compared (F 3.321, p&lt;0.01). While males and females were found to have comparable FIQR scores, the interaction between gender and marital status indicated that separated/divorced males have higher FIQR scores (F 5.684, p=0.001). The multiple regression analysis demonstrated that patients who reported lower educational level experienced more severe FM symptoms, as scored with FIQR (p&lt;0.0001). Our results indicated that being male and separated/divorced is associated to higher severity of FM symptoms, as rated with FIQR. Furthermore, a relationship between educational level and FIQR scores has been detected.

It has been shown to be a powerful predictor of many developmental outcomes and to mitigate the impact of risk conditions. However, longitudinal studies on MM reporting changes over time and individual differences among mothers have been scant and quite inconclusive, mainly due to the investigation of changes between only two time points. The current study analyzes MM's developmental trajectories across four time points (3, 6, 9, and 12 months of infants' age) along with the moderating effects of four variables (maternal sensitivity, age, education, and family income). The sample included healthy mother-infant dyads (<i>N</i> = 93, 46 female infants), belonging to monolingual Italian predominantly middle-class families, with 15% (<i>n</i> = 14) classified as low income (below the relative poverty threshold). The dyads were videotaped during semistructured play interactions and transcripts were coded for appropriate mind-related comments (AMRCs) and nonattuned mind-related comments (NAMRCs). Mothers' AMRCs, compared to NAMRCs, showed more temporal stability. Both AMRCs and NAMRCs showed a linear decrease with individual differences across dyads decreasing over time, and dyads becoming increasingly similar one with the other. Low income moderated the normative trend of appropriate mind-related comments. These findings suggest that MM, while depending largely on an individual trait at earlier ages, when infants' mental states are less intelligible, adapts to the increase of infants' sociocommunicative repertoire over time. They also highlight the importance of ecological constraints on the quality of caregiving.

A registry study of 656 adult subjects with chronic otitis media that underwent a middle ear surgery between 2014 and 2018. Healthcare contacts related to all publicly funded specialist ENT care, audiological care and primary care for a disease of the ear and mastoid process were extracted. The data are extracted from the Swedish National Patient Registry on subjects that reside in western Sweden. Subjects made 13,782 healthcare contacts at a total cost 61.1 million SEK (6.0 million EUR) between 2014 and 2018. The mean cost per subject was 93,075 SEK (9071 EUR) and ranged between 3971 SEK (387 EUR) and 468,711 SEK (45,683 EUR) per individual. In the most expensive quartile of subjects, mean cost was 192,353 SEK (18,747 EUR) over the 5-year period. These subjects made 3227 ENT contacts (roughly four each year) and 60% of total costs were associated with in-patient ENT care. Patients with chronic otitis media are associated with high ENT resource utilization that does not diminish after surgical intervention and the disease places a long-term burden on healthcare systems. Significant costs are attributed to revision surgeries, indicating that these patients could be managed more effectively. In many such cases, reoperation cannot be avoided, especially due to recurrence of cholesteatoma. However, in some patients, when the indication for subsequent surgery is only hearing improvement, alternative options, such as hearing aids or implants, should also be considered.

Participants' self-reported race and ethnicity were grouped into: nHW, non-Hispanic Black/African American (nHB/AA), Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian (nHA). Analyses examined trimester-specific (first (T1), second (T2), third (T3)) nocturnal sleep duration, quality, and disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and ECHO maternal sleep health questionnaire). Linear or multinomial regressions estimated the associations between race/ethnicity and each sleep domain by trimester, controlling for body mass index and age, with nHW as reference group.

Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) represent one of the major components of the extracellular matrix. Here we aimed to understand the role of sesamin (SES), a major lignan compound, in the biosynthesis and degradation of CSPGs in the mouse hippocampus because CSPGs play a key role in the regulation of cognitive functions through the promotion of adult neurogenesis. The expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1&#x3b2; was decreased by SES administration in the hippocampus of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice, a model of neuroinflammation-induced cognitive deficits. The expression of genes related to biosynthesis and degradation of CSPGs in the hippocampus of LPS-treated mice was both increased and decreased by SES administration. Further, the diffuse extracellular matrix labeling of CSPGs by Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) in the hippocampus of LPS-treated mice was increased by SES administration. The densities of neural stem cells, late transit-amplifying cells, and newborn-granule cells in the hippocampus of LPS-treated mice were also increased by SES administration. Moreover, SES-induced alterations in gene expression, WFA labeling, and adult neurogenesis in LPS-treated mice were more evident in the dorsal hippocampus (center of cognition) than in the ventral hippocampus (center of emotion). Neither LPS nor SES administration affected locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, and depression-related behavior. However, impairments in contextual memory and sensorimotor gating in LPS-treated mice were recovered by SES administration.

Several effective interventions can ameliorate this situation. However, the magnitude of the education gap in schizophrenia and its change over time are unclear. We aimed to reconstruct the trajectories of educational attainment in patients with schizophrenia and, if reported, their healthy comparator controls. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis including all studies reporting on patients with schizophrenia (of mean age &#x2265;18 years) and describing the number of years of education of the participants, with or without healthy controls. There were no other design constraints on studies. We excluded studies that included only patients with other schizophrenia spectrum disorders and studies that did not specify the number of years of education of the participants. 22 reviewers participated in retrieving data from a search in PubMed and PsycINFO (Jan 1, 1970, to Nov 24, 2020). We estimated the birth date of participants from their mean age and publication date, and meta-analysed these data using random-effects models, focusing on educational attainment, the education gap, and changes over time. The primary outcome was years of education. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020220546). From 32&#x2008;593 initial references, we included 3321 studies reporting on 318&#x2008;632 patients alongside 138&#x2008;675 healthy controls (170&#x2008;941 women and 275&#x2008;821 men from studies describing sex or gender; data on ethnicity were not collected). Patients' educational attainment increased over time, mirroring that of controls. However, patients with schizophrenia in high-income countries had 19 months less education than controls (-1&#xb7;59 years, 95% CI -1&#xb7;66 to -1&#xb7;53; p&lt;0&#xb7;0001), which is equivalent to a Cohen's d of -0&#xb7;56 (95% CI -0&#xb7;58 to -0&#xb7;54) and implies an odds ratio of 2&#xb7;58 for not completing 12 years of education (ie, not completing secondary education) for patients compared with controls. This gap remained stable throughout the decades; the rate of change in number of total years of education in time was not significant (annual change: 0&#xb7;0047 years, 95% CI -0&#xb7;0005 to 0&#xb7;0099; p=0&#xb7;078). For patients in low-income and middle-income countries, the education gap was significantly smaller than in high-income countries (smaller by 0&#xb7;72 years, 0&#xb7;85 to 0&#xb7;59; p&lt;0&#xb7;0001), yet there was evidence that this gap was widening over the years, approaching that of high-income countries (annual change: -0&#xb7;024 years, -0&#xb7;037 to -0&#xb7;011; p=0&#xb7;0002). Patients with schizophrenia have faced persistent inequality in educational attainment in the last century, despite advances in psychosocial and pharmacological treatment.

However, decades of unfortunate historical, sociocultural and leadership challenges make the continent a hotspot for poverty, indoor and outdoor pollutants with attendant stress factors such as violence, malnutrition, infectious outbreaks and psychological perturbations. The burden of these stressors initiate neuroinflammatory responses but the pattern and mechanisms of glial activation in these scenarios are yet to be properly elucidated. Africa is therefore most vulnerable to neurological stressors when placed against a backdrop of demographics that favor explosive childbearing, a vast population of unemployed youths making up a projected 42% of global youth population by 2030, repressive sociocultural policies towards women, poor access to healthcare, malnutrition, rapid urbanization, climate change and pollution. Early life stress, whether physical or psychological, induces neuroinflammatory response in developing nervous system and consequently leads to the emergence of mental health problems during adulthood. Brain inflammatory response is driven largely by inflammatory mediators released by glial cells; namely astrocytes and microglia. These inflammatory mediators alter the developmental trajectory of fetal and neonatal brain and results in long-lasting maladaptive behaviors and cognitive deficits. This review seeks to highlight the patterns and mechanisms of stressors such as poverty, developmental stress, environmental pollutions as well as malnutrition stress on astrocytes and microglia in neuroinflammation within the African context.",2022,1,1,"Frontiers in immunology","10.3389/fimmu.2022.795089","PMC9190229","Front Immunol","eng","D000293; D000328; D001253; D005260; D006801; D007231; D007249; D018836; D044342; D017628; D000090862","Adolescent; Adult; Astrocytes; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Malnutrition; Microglia; Neuroinflammatory Diseases",NA,"10.1126/science.1190928; 10.1038/s41593-020-00783-4; 10.3389/fimmu.2020.01394; 10.3389/fncel.2015.00261; 10.1016/j.it.2016.06.006; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1514-09.2009; 10.1038/nm.3681; 10.1084/jem.20110698; 10.1016/j.neures.2020.11.005; 10.1016/s0165-5728(02)00029-2; 10.1097/nen.0b013e31812571b0; 10.1177/0269881118754680; 10.1016/j.cmet.2011.08.016; 10.1016/j.neuron.2015.03.035; 10.1002/glia.20671; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0756-16.2017; 10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.018; 10.1038/nrn1824; 10.1093/brain/awm047; 10.1002/ana.21837; 10.1002/ana.24630; 10.3390/ijms21249632; 10.1186/1742-2094-9-280; 10.1016/j.neuron.2018.03.010; 10.1038/nature25752; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0723-07.2007; 10.1016/j.it.2007.01.005; 10.2174/157339510791823655; 10.1084/jem.20202715; 10.4110/in.2018; 10.1084/jem.20041918; 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06190.x; 10.1016/j.bbi.2010.09.015; 10.1093/brain/awq359; 10.1128/JVI.03307-12; 10.1111/apm.12740; 10.1186/1742-2094-11-10; 10.1186/1742-2094-11-105; 10.1016/S0165-5728(98)91399-6; 10.1038/nm.3868; 10.1371/journal.pone.0042088; 10.1186/s12974-020-01861-x; 10.1002/glia.22675; 10.18632/oncotarget.6914; 10.1002/eji.201242679; 10.1093/brain/awh680; 10.1084/jem.20041674; 10.1186/s12974-018-1136-2; 10.1016/j.immuni.2015.03.011; 10.1002/cne.21123; 10.1111/j.1469-7580.2010.01245.x; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1619-13.2014; 10.1113/JP272134; 10.15252/embj.201696056; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3441-12.2013; 10.1177/1535370216664430; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1268-12.2013; 10.1371/journal.pone.0081218; 10.1016/j.cell.2013.11.030; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1167-12.2012; 10.1038/ncomms12540; 10.3389/fncel.2018.00488; 10.1038/nrn3722; 10.1038/s41582-019-0184-2; 10.1016/j.expneurol.2015.08.018; 10.1186/1742-2094-11-98; 10.1016/j.tins.2009.08.002; 10.1038/nri2748; 10.1155/2013/208093; 10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.018; 10.1016/j.immuni.2017.06.006; 10.1038/s41586-018-0119-x; 10.1126/science.aal3589; 10.1016/j.cell.2019.08.053; 10.1038/s41577-019-0125-8; 10.1038/s41586-020-1999-0; 10.1016/j.neuron.2020.08.012; 10.1146/annurev-immunol-093019-110159; 10.1523/jneurosci.6221-11.2012; 10.1038/s41586-021-03960-y; 10.1212/NXI.0000000000001043; 10.1212/NXI.0000000000000933; 10.1073/pnas.1120611109; 10.1016/j.celrep.2016.09.082; 10.1126/scisignal.aad0612; 10.1073/pnas.2016451117; 10.1038/s41423-020-00585-5; 10.1212/nxi.0000000000000946; 10.1124/pr.113.007823; 10.1016/j.immuni.2017.12.012; 10.1016/j.coi.2021.02.003; 10.1016/j.cell.2018.12.012; 10.1016/j.immuni.2019.04.006; 10.1038/nri2356; 10.1084/jem.194.7.873; 10.1016/j.cell.2019.11.016; 10.1007/BF02740665; 10.1038/75068; 10.1186/s12974-015-0293-9; 10.1038/ni.3632; 10.1126/science.abf1230; 10.1038/s41590-020-0654-0; 10.1084/jem.20102049; 10.1126/science.aal3535; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0481-10.2010; 10.1172/jci92300; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.05.028; 10.1001/archpsyc.61.8.774; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2014.13121579; 10.1038/mp.2012.197; 10.1016/j.bbi.2016.06.005; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.11.024; 10.1126/science.1202529; 10.1016/j.bbr.2016.09.006; 10.1523/ENEURO.0297-16.2016; 10.1016/j.neuron.2014.02.040; 10.1113/jphysiol.2005.102939; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.07.011; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6078-09.2010; 10.1016/s0959-4388(02)00299-4; 10.1038/sj.mp.4001748; 10.1016/j.bbi.2010.03.005; 10.3389/fncel.2016.00173; 10.1038/pr.2015.86; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2178-07.2007; 10.1016/j.bbi.2013.05.007; 10.1186/1742-2094-9-71; 10.1016/j.bbi.2012.11.013; 10.1007/s00401-009-0590-4; 10.3389/fnsyn.2017.00010; 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00698; 10.3389/fimmu.2019.00625; 10.1186/2049-9957-2-26; 10.3389/fimmu.2019.00573; 10.1016/S2214-109X(14)70227-X; 10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30109-1; 10.1179/027249303235002215; 10.1080/02724936.1989.11748629; 10.1111/j.1469-8749.1991.tb05113.x; 10.1002/aur.1766; 10.1186/1752-4458-6-9; 10.1126/science.aay8833; 10.1038/nn.4402; 10.1016/j.neuron.2019.05.002; 10.1017/S0033291719001703; 10.1016/j.pt.2013.03.005; 10.4269/ajtmh.20-1553; 10.1503/cmaj.050342; 10.1186/s12887-015-0496-3; 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)17791-5","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","Neuroscience Unit, Department of Veterinary Anatomy, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."

These disorders involve underlying disruption of reward circuits and likely vary by sex. Accordingly, we previously found that ELA leads to anhedonia for natural rewards and cocaine in male rodents, whereas in females ELA instead increases vulnerability to addiction-like use of opioid drugs and palatable food. While these findings suggest that ELA-induced disruption of reward circuitry may differ between the sexes, the specific circuit nodes that are influenced by ELA in either sex remain poorly understood. Here, in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, we ask how ELA impacts opioid addiction-relevant behaviors that we previously tested after ELA in females. We probe potential circuit mechanisms in males by assessing opioid-associated neuronal activation in stress and reward circuit nodes including nucleus accumbens (NAc), amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and paraventricular thalamus. We find that ELA diminishes opioid-seeking behaviors in males, and alters heroin-induced activation of NAc, PFC, and amygdala, suggesting a potential circuit-based mechanism. These studies demonstrate that ELA leads to behavioral and neurobiological disruptions consistent with anhedonia in male rodents, unlike the increased opioid seeking we previously saw in females. Our findings, taken together with our prior work, suggest that men and women could face qualitatively different mental health consequences of ELA, which may be essential for individually tailoring future intervention strategies.",2022,6,16,"Translational psychiatry","10.1038/s41398-022-01988-w","PMC9200783","Transl Psychiatry","eng","D000076783; D000701; D059445; D000818; D005260; D006801; D008297; D051381; D017207; D012201","Adverse Childhood Experiences; Analgesics, Opioid; Anhedonia; Animals; Female; Humans; Male; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Reward","P50 DA044118; DA051137; F30 DA051137; GM008620; MH096889; T32 MH119049; MH119049; P50 MH096889; UL1 TR001414; DA044118","NA","The authors declare no competing interests.","Department of Neurobiology &amp; Behavior, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA."

This study sought to determine whether higher levels of neighborhood poverty would be associated with reduced HV among individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P), and whether social engagement would moderate this association. This cross-sectional study included a sample of participants (N &#x2005;=&#x2005; 174, age-range&#x2005;=&#x2005;12-33 years, 35.1% female) recruited for the second phase of the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study. Generalized linear mixed models tested the association between neighborhood poverty and bilateral HV, as well as the moderating role of social engagement on this association. Higher levels of neighborhood poverty were associated with reduced left (&#x3b2; &#x2005;=&#x2005; -0.180, P &#x2005;=&#x2005; .016) and right HV (&#x3b2; &#x2005;=&#x2005; -0.185, P &#x2005;=&#x2005; .016). Social engagement significantly moderated the relation between neighborhood poverty and bilateral HV.

Patients with isolated epidural hematomas (EDH) with access to timely surgical intervention often sustain favorable outcomes. Efforts to ensure safe, timely, and affordable access to EDH treatment may offer tremendous benefits. A comprehensive literature search was conducted. A random-effects model was used to pool the outcomes. Studies were further categorized into groups by World Bank Income classification: high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Forty-nine studies were included, including 36 from HICs, 12 from LMICs, and 1 from HIC / LMIC. Incidence of EDH amongst TBI patients 8.2 % (95 % CI: 5.9,11.2), including 9.2 % (95 %CI 6.4,13.2) in HICs and 5.8 % (95 % CI: 3.1,10.7) in LMICs (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.20). The overall percent male was 73.7 % and 47.4 % were caused by road traffic accidents. Operative rate was 76.0 % (95 %CI: 67.9,82.6), with a numerically lower rate of 74.2 % (95 %CI: 64.0,81.8) in HICs than in LMICs 82.9 % (95 %CI: 65.4,92.5) (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.33).

"35658811","Population variation in social brain morphology: Links to socioeconomic status and health disparity.","Nathania Suryoputri, Hannah Kiesow, Danilo Bzdok","Health disparity across layers of society involves reasons beyond the healthcare system. Socioeconomic status (SES) shapes people's daily interaction with their social environment and is known to impact various health outcomes. Using generative probabilistic modeling, we investigate health satisfaction and complementary indicators of socioeconomic lifestyle in the human social brain. In a population cohort of ~10,000 UK Biobank participants, our first analysis probed the relationship between health status and subjective social standing (i.e., financial satisfaction). We identified volume effects in participants unhappy with their health in regions of the higher associative cortex, especially the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). Specifically, participants in poor subjective health showed deviations in dmPFC and TPJ volume as a function of financial satisfaction. The second analysis on health status and objective social standing (i.e., household income) revealed volume deviations in regions of the limbic system for individuals feeling unhealthy. In particular, low-SES participants dissatisfied with their health showed deviations in volume distributions in the amygdala and hippocampus bilaterally.

"35657054","Development of a novel 10-echo multi-contrast sequence based on EPIK to deliver simultaneous quantification of T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> with application to oxygen extraction fraction.","Fabian K&#xfc;ppers, Seong Dae Yun, N Jon Shah","The simultaneous quantification of T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> * maps based on fast sequences for combined GE and SE acquisition has rekindled research and clinical interest by offering a wide range of attractive applications, e.g., dynamic tracking of oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). However, previously published methods based on EPI-readouts have been hindered by resolution and the number of acquired echoes. This work presents a novel 10-echo GE-SE EPIK (EPI with keyhole) sequence for the rapid quantification of T<sub>2</sub> '. T<sub>2</sub> /T<sub>2</sub> * maps from the GE-SE EPIK sequence were validated using three phantoms and 15 volunteers at 3T. The incorporation of a sliding window approach, combined with the full sampling of the k-space center inherent to EPIK, enables a high effective temporal resolution. That is, for an eight-slice breath-hold experiment, a temporal sampling rate of eight reconstructed slices per 1.1&#xa0;s. In comparison with repeated single-echo SE, multi-echo GE, and spectroscopy methods, the GE-SE EPIK sequence shows good agreement in quantifying T<sub>2</sub> /T<sub>2</sub> * values, while the gray matter/white matter separation yielded the expected contrast differentiation. The OEF was calculated with a view to an initial application with clinical relevance, producing results comparable to those in the literature and with good sensitivity in breath-hold experiments. GE-SE EPIK provides increased resolution and more echoes, including two SEs, than comparable sequences. Moreover, GE-SE EPIK achieves this within an acquisition time of 57&#x2009;s for 20 slices (matrix size&#xa0;=&#xa0;128&#xd7;128; FOV&#xa0;=&#xa0;24&#x2009;cm) and with a reasonably short TE for the final echo (114&#x2009;ms).

The risks of drug abuse may not be fully understood by all members of society, partly because of the taboo nature of the subject, and partly because of the considerable gap between scientific production/understanding and communication of such knowledge to the public at large. Drug use is a major challenge to social development and a leading cause of school dropout rates worldwide. Some public policies adopted in several countries in recent decades failed to prevent drug use, especially because they focused on imposing combative or coercive measures, investing little or nothing in education and prevention. Here we highlight the role of neuroscience education as a valid approach in drug use education and prevention.

Food insecurity in female-identified caregivers is particularly concerning, given its association with their mental health and adverse health outcomes for their children. Food insecurity is associated with disordered eating but, to our knowledge, no prior studies have examined an association between food insecurity and food addiction. Our aim was to examine whether food insecurity is associated with higher food addiction symptom endorsement in low-income female adults. Secondary analysis of baseline data from a quasi-experimental study of a mindfulness-based intervention on gestational weight gain among low-income pregnant individuals and an observational study of low-income families. Participants in study 1 (n&#xa0;= 208) were English-speaking, low-income pregnant individuals with overweight or obesity, recruited in California from 2011 to 2013. Participants in study 2 (n&#xa0;= 181) were English-speaking, low-income female caregivers for children aged 8 through 10 years, recruited in Michigan from 2018 to 2019. Both studies recruited participants from community health clinics, social service agencies, and online advertisements. The primary outcome measure was food addiction symptoms, assessed by the Yale Food Addiction Scale. Multivariate Poisson regression was used to examine the association between household food insecurity and food addiction symptoms in each sample, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. In study 1, pregnant individuals in food-insecure households reported 21% higher food addiction symptoms than pregnant individuals in food-secure households (incidence rate ratio 1.21; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.47; P&#xa0;= .047). In study 2, caregivers in food-insecure households had 56% higher food addiction symptoms than caregivers in food-secure households (incidence rate ratio 1.56; 95% CI 1.01 to 2.40; P&#xa0;= .045). These findings provide preliminary support for a relationship between household food insecurity and food addiction.

We first establish robust SES-gray matter relations across a number of brain regions, cortical and subcortical. These regional correlates are parsed into predominantly genetic factors and those potentially due to the environment. We show that genetic effects are stronger in some areas (prefrontal cortex, insula) than others.

Yet public healthcare does not include routine detection and treatment for these disorders. This pilot study aims to evaluate the implementation outcomes of a health systems strengthening (HSS) intervention for improving the quality of care of perinatal women with CMD and experiences of domestic violence, attending public healthcare facilities in Cape Town. Three antenatal care facilities were purposively selected for delivery of a HSS programme consisting of four components: (1) health promotion and awareness raising talks delivered by lay healthcare workers; (2) detection of CMD and domestic violence by nurses as part of routine care; (3) referral of women with CMD and domestic violence; and (4) delivery of structured counselling by lay healthcare workers in patients' homes. Participants included healthcare workers tasked with delivery of the HSS components, and perinatal women attending the healthcare facilities for routine antenatal care. This mixed methods study used qualitative interviews with healthcare workers and pregnant women, a patient survey, observation of health promotion and awareness raising talks, and a review of several documents, to evaluate the acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, adoption, fidelity of delivery, and fidelity of receipt of the HSS components. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the qualitative interviews, while the quantitative findings for adoption and fidelity of receipt were reported using numbers and proportions. Healthcare workers found the delivery and content of the HSS components to be both acceptable and appropriate, while the feasibility, adoption and fidelity of delivery was poor. We demonstrated that the health promotion and awareness raising component improved women's attitudes towards seeking help for mental health conditions. The detection, referral and treatment components were found to improve fidelity of receipt, evidenced by an increase in the proportion of women undergoing routine detection and referral, and decreased feelings of distress in women who received counselling. However, using a task-sharing approach did not prove to be feasible, as adding additional responsibilities to already overburdened healthcare workers roles resulted in poor fidelity of delivery and adoption of all the HSS components. The acceptability, appropriateness and fidelity of receipt of the HSS programme components, and poor feasibility, fidelity of delivery and adoption suggest the need to appoint dedicated, lay healthcare workers to deliver key programme components, at healthcare facilities, on the same day.",2022,5,13,"BMC health services research","10.1186/s12913-022-08050-x","PMC9099309","BMC Health Serv Res","eng","D017579; D005240; D005260; D006801; D001523; D010865; D011247; D013019","Domestic Violence; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Mental Disorders; Pilot Projects; Pregnancy; South Africa",NA,"10.1017/S204017441700071X; 10.1007/s00127-018-1497-y; 10.1186/1742-4755-8-9; 10.7196/SAMJ.6009; 10.1007/s00737-017-0768-z; 10.2471/BLT.12.109819; 10.1007/s11121-013-0376-8; 10.1007/s10488-010-0319-7; 10.7196/SAMJ.9181; 10.1136/bmjgh-2018-000962; 10.1186/s12913-016-1904-6; 10.1186/1471-2288-13-117; 10.1186/s13033-021-00443-5; 10.4103/0970-0218.94009; 10.3402/gha.v7.24085; 10.1186/1478-4491-7-15; 10.4102/curationis.v39i1.1545; 10.1016/j.midw.2017.12.020; 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032816-045217; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.08.004; 10.1007/s10597-020-00734-0; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.07.057","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Alan J Flisher Centre for Public Mental Health, Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, University of Cape Town, Building B, 46 Sawkins Road, Rondebosch, Cape Town, 7700, South Africa."
"35545630","The impact of digital media on children's intelligence while controlling for genetic differences in cognition and socioeconomic background.","Bruno Sauce, Magnus Liebherr, Nicholas Judd, Torkel Klingberg","Digital media defines modern childhood, but its cognitive effects are unclear and hotly debated. We believe that studies with genetic data could clarify causal claims and correct for the typically unaccounted role of genetic predispositions. Here, we estimated the impact of different types of screen time (watching, socializing, or gaming) on children's intelligence while controlling for the confounding effects of genetic differences in cognition and socioeconomic status. We analyzed 9855 children from the USA who were part of the ABCD dataset with measures of intelligence at baseline (ages 9-10) and after two years. At baseline, time watching (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#xa0;0.12) and socializing (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#xa0;0.10) were negatively correlated with intelligence, while gaming did not correlate. After two years, gaming positively impacted intelligence (standardized &#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;+&#x2009;0.17), but socializing had no effect. This is consistent with cognitive benefits documented in experimental studies on video gaming. Unexpectedly, watching videos also benefited intelligence (standardized &#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;+&#x2009;0.12), contrary to prior research on the effect of watching TV. Although, in a posthoc analysis, this was not significant if parental education (instead of SES) was controlled for. Broadly, our results are in line with research on the malleability of cognitive abilities from environmental factors, such as cognitive training and the Flynn effect.",2022,5,11,"Scientific reports","10.1038/s41598-022-11341-2","PMC9095723","Sci Rep","eng","D002648; D003071; D006801; D007360; D020407; D012923; D013690","Child; Cognition; Humans; Intelligence; Internet; Social Class; Television","U24 DA041147; U01 DA051039; U01 DA041120; U01 DA051018; U01 DA041093; U24 DA041123; U01 DA051038; U01 DA051037; U01 DA051016; U01 DA041106; U01 DA041117; U01 DA041148; U01 DA041174; U01 DA041134; U01 DA041022; U01 DA041156; U01 DA050987; U01 DA041025; U01 DA050989; U01 DA041089; U01 DA050988; U01 DA041028; U01 DA041048","10.1016/j.jadohealth.2015.11.014; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2019.3176; 10.1542/peds.2016-2593; 10.1136/bmj.h3064; 10.1037/a0026699; 10.1038/s41380-021-01027-y; 10.1016/j.dr.2016.12.002; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.10.040; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.066; 10.1016/j.chb.2020.106312; 10.1177/0956797618774253; 10.1371/journal.pone.0237908; 10.1001/archpedi.161.5.480; 10.1542/peds.113.4.708; 10.1371/journal.pone.0087943; 10.1007/s11469-019-00126-w; 10.1037/a0013341; 10.1016/j.actpsy.2008.08.010; 10.1080/00220671.2020.1861583; 10.1007/s10826-020-01754-w; 10.31887/DCNS.2019.21.3/skuehn; 10.1037/bul0000130; 10.1037/0033-295X.100.3.363; 10.1177/0963721411421922; 10.1038/s41562-021-01118-4; 10.1016/j.dr.2009.05.002; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.11.010; 10.1371/journal.pone.0103559; 10.1542/peds.2009-1508; 10.1038/s41588-018-0147-3; 10.1038/s41562-020-0862-5; 10.1038/s41539-020-00079-z; 10.1089/cyber.2019.0480; 10.3102/00346543075003417; 10.1038/mp.2015.2; 10.1371/annotation/b91ba224-10be-409d-93f4-7423d502cba0; 10.1016/j.dr.2016.06.004; 10.1037/bul0000131; 10.1016/j.ajhg.2019.06.006; 10.1080/19485565.2019.1681257; 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014585; 10.1073/pnas.2001228117; 10.1038/s41539-021-00096-6; 10.1038/srep06085; 10.1371/journal.pone.0186621; 10.1037/0096-1523.32.6.1465; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01853.x; 10.1037/a0037556; 10.3758/s13423-013-0418-z; 10.3389/fnhum.2017.00248; 10.1016/j.actpsy.2008.09.005; 10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00031; 10.1542/peds.2007-0978; 10.1073/pnas.1711548115; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.5056; 10.1542/peds.2011-0054; 10.1353/foc.0.0004; 10.1126/science.1167190; 10.2466/PR0.105.F.1237-1247; 10.1016/j.intell.2016.10.002; 10.1016/j.intell.2013.05.008; 10.1037/0033-2909.97.1.129; 10.1177/1745691620984483; 10.1177/0003122419886550; 10.1080/13803395.2017.1313393; 10.1016/j.ajhg.2021.07.010; 10.1038/s41562-021-01117-5; 10.1080/15248372.2017.1419246; 10.1016/j.dcn.2017.10.002; 10.1016/j.dcn.2017.06.005; 10.1007/s00127-019-01825-4; 10.1016/j.dcn.2018.02.006; 10.7326/M13-2946; 10.1002/wcs.1176; 10.1002/rev3.3293; 10.1177/0162353218799481; 10.1037/pas0000791; 10.1186/s12864-016-2495-7; 10.1093/gigascience/giy165; 10.1038/s41588-017-0009-4; 10.1038/s41467-019-11112-0; 10.1038/ng1847; 10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163612; 10.1080/10705511.2015.1030022; 10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00738; 10.1016/j.dcn.2017.11.007; 10.18637/jss.v048.i02; 10.1080/10705519909540118; 10.1177/1094428107300343","The authors declare no competing interests.","Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden."

Given limited tools for assessing these effects early in life, the authors explore how enhanced capacity to measure stress activation directly in young children could transform the role and scope of pediatric practice. When employed within a trusted relationship between caregivers and clinicians, selective use of biological measures of stress responses would help address the documented limitations of rating scales of adverse childhood experiences as a primary indicator of individual risk and strengthen the ability to focus on variation in intervention needs, assess their effectiveness, and guide ongoing management. The authors provide an overview of the potential benefits and risks of such expanded measurement capacity, as well as an introduction to candidate indicators that might be employed in an office setting. The ultimate value of such measures for both pediatricians and parents will require vigilant attention to the ethical responsibilities of assuring their correct interpretation and minimizing the harm of inappropriate labeling, especially for children and families experiencing the hardships and threats of racism, poverty, and other structural inequities. Whereas much work remains to be done to advance measurement development and ensure its equitable use, the potential of validated markers of stress activation and resilience to strengthen the impact of primary health care on the lives of young children facing significant adversity demands increased attention.",2022,6,1,"Pediatrics","10.1542/peds.2021-054493",NA,"Pediatrics","eng","D000076783; D001695; D017028; D002648; D000067576; D002669; D002675; D006801","Adverse Childhood Experiences; Biology; Caregivers; Child; Child Health; Child Welfare; Child, Preschool; Humans",NA,"NA",NA,"Ludmer Centre for Neuroinformatics and Mental Health, Douglas Hospital Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."

Perinatal CMDs have been associated with several adverse maternal and child outcomes. While the Department of Health in South Africa provides healthcare workers with the tools to detect psychological distress and experiences of domestic violence, few healthcare workers routinely screen pregnant women at clinic visits, citing discomfort with mental health issues and the lack of standardised referral pathways as the key barriers. The aim of this study is to select and evaluate a set of health systems strengthening (HSS) interventions aimed at improving the care and outcomes for perinatal women with CMDs and experiences of domestic violence, attending public healthcare facilities in Cape Town. This study consists of a pre-implementation, development, and implementation phase. Contextual barriers identified during the pre-implementation phase included poor patient knowledge and health-seeking behaviour, high levels of stigma, and poor detection, referral, and treatment rates. Implementation science determinant frameworks were applied to findings from the pre-implementation phase to identify determinants and gaps in delivering high-quality evidence-informed care. A participatory Theory of Change workshop was used to design a HSS programme, consisting of awareness raising, detection, referral, and treatment. HSS interventions selected to support the delivery of the HSS programme includes training, health promotion, change to the healthcare environment, task-sharing, audit and feedback, and performance monitoring. The implementation phase will be used to assess several implementation and clinical outcomes associated with the delivery of the HSS programme, which will be piloted at three healthcare facilities. Qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to evaluate the implementation and clinical outcomes. This pilot implementation study will inform us about a range of implementation and clinical outcome measures that are relevant for assessing HSS interventions for perinatal women with depression, anxiety, or experiences of domestic violence in low-resource settings.

However, the nature of these associations is unclear. To characterize the pleiotropy between psychiatric and immune-related traits, as well as risk factors of hypothesized relevance. This genetic association study was conducted from July 10, 2020, to January 15, 2022. Analyses used genome-wide association (GWA) statistics related to 14 psychiatric traits; 13 immune-related phenotypes, ie, allergic, autoimmune, and inflammatory disorders; and 15 risk factors related to health-related behaviors, social determinants of health, and stress response. Genetically correlated psychiatric-immune pairs were assessed using 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR) with sensitivity analyses and multivariable adjustment for genetic associations of third variables. False discovery rate correction (Q value &lt; .05) was applied for each analysis. Genetic associations. Genetic correlations and MR association estimates with SEs and P values. A data-driven approach was used that did not test a priori planned hypotheses. A total of 44 genetically correlated psychiatric-immune pairs were identified, including 31 positive correlations (most consistently involving asthma, Crohn disease, hypothyroidism, and ulcerative colitis) and 13 negative correlations (most consistently involving allergic rhinitis and type 1 diabetes). Correlations with third variables were especially strong for psychiatric phenotypes. MR identified 7 associations of psychiatric phenotypes on immune-related phenotypes that were robust to multivariable adjustment, including the positive association of (1) the psychiatric cross-disorder phenotype with asthma (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.06), Crohn disease (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05-1.14), and ulcerative colitis (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05-1.14); (2) major depression with asthma (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.13-1.37); (3) schizophrenia with Crohn disease (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.18) and ulcerative colitis (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.07-1.21); and a negative association of risk tolerance with allergic rhinitis (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67-0.92).

Children exposed to such environments may benefit from interventions that target social communication abilities, since these are protective factors for healthy neurodevelopment. This randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy of Paediatric Autism Communication Therapy (PACT) in improving social communication development in young children at risk for neurodevelopmental difficulties living in poverty in Brazil. Participants will be 160 children aged 2-4 years with lower-than-average social communication abilities and their primary caregivers. Child-caregiver dyads will be recruited from public childhood education centers in impoverished urban regions of the city of S&#xe3;o Paulo, Brazil. Lower-than-average social communication abilities will be defined by standard scores (&#x2264;84) on the socialization and/or communication domains of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. Child-caregiver dyads will be randomized to receive 12 sessions of the PACT intervention (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;80) or 5 months of community support as usual plus psychoeducation (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;80). The primary outcome (parent-child interaction) and secondary outcomes (parent-reported social communication abilities and neurophysiological activity during a live social interaction) will be measured pre- and postintervention.

"35499277","Contextualizing school achievement among vulnerable learners: Implications for science and practice: Commentary.","Laurie E Cutting","The current set of papers in this special issue capture the range of viewpoints, scientific approaches, and populations needed to illuminate and tackle the issues of school achievement among vulnerable learners. This includes providing a framework for researchers to work from relevant policy findings, and literature reviews to small scale studies. The manuscripts also traverse different aspects of scientific inquiry - from data reported by federal and state programs, thus providing a ""bird's eye view"" of findings, to more granular neurobiological approaches. Across all papers is the clear theme of needing to shift from where we have been in order to establish a path forward for where we need to go to account for learners that have been relatively neglected in scientific studies. To break down barriers of inequity and increase our understanding of causes and consequences of vulnerable learners, there is a need to re-think how we establish policies and allocate funds, as well as broadening our lens as we conduct scientific studies. Each piece in this special issue calls for the need to better understand these issues that vulnerable learners face to address inequities in our educational ecosystems. Together they provide a rich set of insights that have significant implications for science and practice.",2022,7,1,"New directions for child and adolescent development","10.1002/cad.20460",NA,"New Dir Child Adolesc Dev","eng","D006801; D017753; D004522; D000076363; D012574","Humans; Ecosystem; Educational Status; Academic Success; Schools",NA,"NA",NA,"Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA."
"35478771","Childhood Trauma and Cortisol Reactivity: An Investigation of the Role of Task Appraisals.","Cory J Counts, Annie T Ginty, Jade M Larsen, Taylor D Kampf, Neha A John-Henderson","Childhood adversity is linked to adverse health in adulthood. One posited mechanistic pathway is through physiological responses to acute stress. Childhood adversity has been previously related to both exaggerated and blunted physiological responses to acute stress, however, less is known about the psychological mechanisms which may contribute to patterns of physiological reactivity linked to childhood adversity. In the current work, we investigated the role of challenge and threat stress appraisals in explaining relationships between childhood adversity and cortisol reactivity in response to an acute stressor. Undergraduate students (<i>n</i> = 81; 61% female) completed an online survey that included general demographic information and the Risky Families Questionnaire 24 h before a scheduled lab visit. In the lab, a research assistant collected a baseline salivary cortisol sample. Following the baseline period, participants were read instructions for the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a validated psychological lab stressor. Next, they completed a challenge vs. threat task appraisal questionnaire and completed the speech and math portion of the TSST. Twenty minutes following the start of the TSST, a second salivary sample was collected to measure changes in salivary cortisol following the TSST. Linear regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, childhood socioeconomic status (SES), and baseline cortisol levels, showed childhood adversity associated with changes in cortisol levels [<i>B</i> = -0.29 <i>t</i>(73) = -2.35, <i>p</i> = 0.02, <i>R</i> <sup>2=0.07</sup>]. Linear regression analyses controlling for age, sex, and childhood SES showed childhood adversity associated with both challenge [<i>B</i> = -0.52 <i>t</i>(74) = -5.04, <i>p</i> &lt; <i>0.001, R</i> <sup>2=0.24</sup>] and threat [<i>B</i> = 0.55 <i>t</i>(74) = 5.40, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, <i>R</i> <sup>2=0.27</sup>] appraisals. Significant indirect effects of childhood trauma on cortisol reactivity were observed through challenge appraisals [<i>B</i> = -0.01 (95% confidence interval = -0.02, -0.003)], and threat appraisals [<i>B</i> = -0.01 (95% confidence interval = -0.01, -0.003)]. Childhood adversity may contribute to blunted cortisol reactivity, a pattern of response which is linked to obesity, addiction, and other behavior-related diseases.

Two internationally recognized, evidence-based models of interventions for employment for people with severe mental health problems are Individual Placement Support and the Clubhouse. In Italy, a common model is the 'social enterprise' (SE), which is a programme run by non-profit organisations that help individuals with disabilities to be employed. Despite SEs spread and relevance in Italy, there are no studies about Italian samples. This paper reports on a pilot evaluation of psychosocial and work outcomes of a SE based in Verona, Italy. The study aims to investigate if people with SMI involved in SE job placements may achieve personal recovery and better outcomes over time, and in comparison with a comparable group of users. This is a pilot descriptive study with three components. A longitudinal design that comprised a functioning description of 33 SE members with a psychiatric disability in two time-points (when they joined the SE-on average 5&#xa0;years before the study recruitment, and at the study recruitment-year 2018); and a repeated collection of job details of the 33 members in three time points: 2&#xa0;years before the recruitment,-year 2016; 1&#xa0;year before the recruitment - year 2017; and at the recruitment-year 2018. An assessment at the recruitment time-year 2018, of SE users' satisfaction with the job placement, symptoms, functioning, and quality of life (QoL). A cross-sectional study that compared the 33 SE members at the recruitment time-year 2018, with a matched group of people with the following criteria: living in local supported accommodations, being unemployed and not SE members. The two groups were compared on ratings of psychopathology, functioning, and QoL. Descriptive analyses were done. At the recruitment time - year 2018, all SE participants showed a significant better functioning (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) than when they joined the SE-when they had been employed for an average of 5&#xa0;years. In comparison to the matched group, SE members had significantly better functioning (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), psychopathology (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007), and QoL (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.034). According to their SE membership status, participants comprised trainees (21.2%) and employee members (78.8%). Trainees compared to employees had lower autonomies, functioning, QoL and more severe psychopathology. Over the two years prior to study recruitment, trainees showed stable poor autonomies, while employee members showed a variation from average autonomies in the 2&#xa0;years before the recruitment time - year 2016, to good ones at the recruitment time - year 2018. Over the two years, all SE members set increasing numbers of objectives in all three domains. All SE participants reported high levels of satisfaction with all aspects of the job placement. SE that provides tailored support to assist people to gain employment skills may be an effective component in helping recovery from SMI.",2022,4,26,"BMC psychiatry","10.1186/s12888-022-03881-8","PMC9040313","BMC Psychiatry","eng","D003430; D016832; D006801; D001523; D010865; D011788","Cross-Sectional Studies; Employment, Supported; Humans; Mental Disorders; Pilot Projects; Quality of Life",NA,"10.1007/s00127-006-0048-0; 10.1192/bjp.bp.105.020982; 10.1186/1471-244X-13-195; 10.1007/BF02188630; 10.1007/s11414-014-9392-0; 10.1002/14651858.CD011867.pub2; 10.1037/prj0000065; 10.1007/s10597-020-00603-w; 10.1002/wps.20017; 10.1192/apt.9.5.327; 10.1186/1472-6963-13-270; 10.1016/j.ijlp.2005.08.001; 10.3233/WOR-2009-0846; 10.3109/09638237.2015.1057324; 10.1097/NMD.0000000000000150; 10.1037/prj0000299; 10.1080/09687599.2015.1057318; 10.1080/09687590802177072; 10.1002/cpp.681; 10.1007/s00127-021-02128-3; 10.1007/s11126-017-9548-1; 10.1177/002076409904500102; 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2018.03.076; 10.3889/oamjms.2015.024; 10.36148/2284-0249-353; 10.36148/2284-0249-355; 10.1007/s00127-019-01723-9; 10.1002/wps.20278","The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.","Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Piazzale L.A.

This study pioneers previously unexplored roles of SE in the context of corneal wound healing by utilizing primary corneal stromal cells from healthy (HCFs), type I diabetes mellitus (T1DMs), type II DM (T2DMs), and keratoconus (HKCs) subjects. Purified, healthy human SEs carrying tetraspanins CD9+, CD63+, and CD81+ were utilized. Scratch and cell migration assays were performed after 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h following SE stimulation (5 and 25 &#xb5;g/mL). Significantly slower wound closure was observed at 6 and 12 h in HCFs with 5 &#x3bc;g/mL SE and T1DMs with 5 and 25 &#x3bc;g/mL SE. All wounds were closed by 24-hour, post-wounding. HKCs, T1DMs, and T2DMs with 25&#xb5;g/mL SE exhibited a significant upregulation of cleaved vimentin compared to controls. Thrombospondin 1 was significantly upregulated in HCFs, HKCs, and T2DMs with 25 &#xb5;g/mL SE. Lastly, HKCs, T1DMs, and T2DMs exhibited a significant downregulation of fibronectin with 25 &#x3bc;g/mL SE. Whether SEs can be utilized to clinical settings in restoring corneal defects is unknown. This is the first-ever study exploring the role of SEs in corneal wound healing.

Individuals enrolled in studies of memory and aging who self-identified as African American (AA) were matched 1:1 to self-identified non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals by age, <i>APOE</i> &#x3b5;4 carrier status, and cognitive status. Each participant underwent blood and CSF collection, and amyloid PET was performed in 103 participants (68%). Plasma A&#x3b2;42/A&#x3b2;40 was measured by a high-performance immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry assay. Plasma p-tau181, p-tau231, and NfL were measured by Simoa immunoassays. CSF A&#x3b2;42/A&#x3b2;40 and amyloid PET status were used as primary and secondary reference standards of brain amyloidosis, respectively. There were 76 matched pairs of AA and NHW participants (n = 152 total). For both AA and NHW groups, the median age was 68.4 years, 42% were <i>APOE</i> &#x3b5;4 carriers, and 91% were cognitively normal.

Additionally, ethnic groups experience adverse socioeconomic circumstances that increase FGR risk. However, the dearth of evidence of the interaction between socioeconomic factors and FGR highlights the need for additional research. To analyze the association between socioeconomic factors and FGR in Maya and non-Maya populations in Yucatan, Mexico. A total of 21,320 singleton births in 2017 in Yucatan were analyzed. The student's <i>t</i>-test and the chi-square test were used to compare the means and proportions of maternal and perinatal variables between the FGR group and the birthweight appropriate for gestational age (AGA) group. Path analysis was performed to identify the direct and indirect effects of socioeconomic factors on FGR and mediators between predictors and FGR. The prevalence of FGR at birth was 9.06%; this rate was higher in the Maya population (12.4, 95% CI 11.3-13.5), without differences between socioeconomic levels. Path analysis revealed sociostructural variables (ethnicity and poverty) are reliable predictors of FGR at birth mediated by maternal education (<i>&#x3b2;</i> = -.152, <i>p</i> &lt; .001) and teenage pregnancy (<i>&#x3b2;</i> = .065, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;.037).

Systematic review. PubMed, CINAHL, ERIC, PsycINFO, Web of Science, WHO Global Index Medicus, and Violence and Abuse Abstracts, hand searching of specialised journals from inception until 19 May 2019. Primary quantitative studies that included a measure of self-reported exposure to IPV prior to age 18 and were conducted in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. Data were screened, extracted and appraised by two independent reviewers. The prevalence estimates were pooled using a random-effects model. Outcomes included lifetime and past-year prevalence of childhood exposure to IPV. Meta-regression was used to explore heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot and Egger's regression test. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. Sixty-two studies with a total of 231 512 participants were included. Eighty-five lifetime prevalence estimates and 6 estimates of past-year prevalence were available for synthesis. The average lifetime prevalence of childhood exposure to IPV was 29% (95% CI 26% to 31%). The average past-year prevalence in children was 35% (95% CI 21% to 48%). The lifetime prevalence disaggregated by WHO regions ranged from 21% to 34%. There were no statistical differences in prevalence estimates between samples of men and women. Almost one-third of children in low-income and lower-middle-income countries have been exposed to IPV in their lifetime. There was large heterogeneity between estimates that was not explained by available study and sample characteristics. Our findings indicate that children's exposure to IPV in low-income and lower-middle-income countries is common and widespread; prevention of this major public health exposure should be a priority.

In this Review, we discuss the prevalence of mental health problems, interventions to address these, and issues of access to treatment and services. Where possible, we take a global perspective, given most children with intellectual disability live in low-income and middle-income countries. Approximately 40% of children with intellectual disability present with a diagnosable mental disorder, a rate that is at least double that in children without intellectual disability.

Also, evidence on neurocognitive processes associated with ageing primarily comes from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) populations, hindering the generalization of findings to persons from upper-middle- and low-middle-income countries, such as those of Latin America. Here, we compared the performance of low- and high-SES older adults from Argentina in cognitive state, executive functions, social cognition (emotion recognition and theory of mind), and counter-empathic social emotions (envy and Schadenfreude; displeasure at others' fortune and pleasure at others' misfortune, respectively). Subsequently, we developed a path analysis to test the relationship among those variables in a theoretically plausible model and tested the main paths via multiple regression analyses. Relative to the high-SES group, low-SES older adults showed poorer performance on all assessed domains. Convergent evidence from covariance analysis, path analysis, and linear regressions suggested that low-SES impact on socioemotional processes was not primary but mediated by cognitive and executive impairment.

"35390609","Schizophrenia: A developmental disorder with a risk of non-specific but avoidable decline.","R M Murray, E Bora, G Modinos, A Vernon","The onset of schizophrenia is determined by biological and social risk factors operating predominantly during development. These result in subtle deviations in brain structure and cognitive function. Striatal dopamine dysregulation follows, causing abnormal salience and resultant psychotic symptoms. Most people diagnosed as having schizophrenia do not progressively deteriorate; many improve or recover. However, poor care can allow a cycle of deterioration to be established, stress increasing dopamine dysregulation, leading to more stress consequent on continuing psychotic experiences, and so further dopamine release. Additionally, long-term antipsychotics can induce dopamine supersensitivity with resultant relapse and eventually treatment resistance. Some patients suffer loss of social and cognitive function, but this is a consequence of the hazards that afflict the person with schizophrenia, not a direct consequence of genetic predisposition. Thus, brain health and cognition can be further impaired by chronic medication effects, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, obesity, poor diet, and lack of exercise; drug use, especially of tobacco and cannabis, are likely to contribute. Poverty, homelessness and poor nutrition which become the lot of some people with schizophrenia, can also affect cognition. Regrettably, the model of progressive deterioration provides psychiatry and its funders with an alibi for the effects of poor care.",2022,5,1,"Schizophrenia research","10.1016/j.schres.2022.03.005",NA,"Schizophr Res","eng","D014150; D002648; D002658; D004298; D006801; D011618; D012559","Antipsychotic Agents; Child; Developmental Disabilities; Dopamine; Humans; Psychotic Disorders; Schizophrenia","MR/N026063/1","NA",NA,"Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, United Kingdom."

While food insecurity likely contributes to poor health through its effect on diet, such a simplistic understanding likely obscures the effects of poverty-related stress and other Adverse Childhood Experiences, on metabolic health. Over two summers, 100 children, ages 8-12&#xa0;years, will be recruited from low-income households in an urban, Rhode Island community, to participate in an 8-week trial designed to isolate the experience of food insecurity. Summer represents a natural risk period of food insecurity in children, such that children will be randomized to receive weekly shipments of five breakfast and lunch meals that mimic school meals or to experience the likely onset of summertime food insecurity and receive a weekly newsletter on community resources that is not expected to affect food insecurity. Through assessment visits at baseline, mid-summer and end of summer, we will examine group differences in change in diet quality, biomarkers of Metabolic Syndrome, inflammation, and stress, BMI z-scores, and child measures of behavior and anxiety and depression symptoms. We will also explore the impact of caregiver mood and stress on the health effects of food insecurity.

We collected data from two large laboratory studies involving 19 prominent behavioral interventions, and we modeled the influence of each intervention using a leading computational model of choice in psychology and neuroscience. This allowed us to parametrize the biases induced by each intervention, to interpret these biases in terms of underlying decision mechanisms and their properties, to quantify similarities between interventions, and to predict how different interventions alter key choice outcomes.

"35360125","Explaining the Association Between Urbanicity and Psychotic-Like Experiences in Pre-Adolescence: The Indirect Effect of Urban Exposures.","Abhishek Saxena, David Dodell-Feder","Urban living is a growing worldwide phenomenon with more than two-thirds of people expected to live in cities by 2050. Although there are many benefits to living in an urban environment, urbanicity has also been associated with deleterious health outcomes, including increased risk for psychotic outcomes particularly when the urban exposure occurs in pre-adolescence. However, the mechanisms underlying this association is unclear. Here, we utilize one-year follow-up data from a large (<i>N</i>=7,979), nationwide study of pre-adolescence in the United States to clarify why urbanicity (i.e., census-tract population density) might impact psychotic-like experiences (PLE) by looking at the indirect effect of eight candidate urbanicity-related physical (e.g., pollution) and social (e.g., poverty) exposures. Consistent with other work, we found that of the evaluated exposures related to urbanicity, several were also related to increased number of PLE: PM<sub>2.5</sub>, proximity to roads, census-level homes at-risk for exposure to lead paint, census-level poverty, and census-level income-disparity. These same urban-related exposures were also related to the persistence of PLE after 1 year, but not new onset of PLE. Mediation analysis revealed that a substantial proportion the urbanicity-PLE association (number and persistence) could be explained by PM<sub>2.5</sub> (23-44%), families in poverty (68-93%), and income disparity (67-80%). Together, these findings suggest that specific urban-related exposures contribute to the existence and maintenance, but not onset of PLE, which might help to explain why those in urban environments are disproportionately at-risk for psychosis and point toward areas for public health intervention.",2022,1,1,"Frontiers in psychiatry","10.3389/fpsyt.2022.831089","PMC8962621","Front Psychiatry","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.4314/as.v17i3.6; 10.1126/science.1150198; 10.1093/ije/dym271; 10.1192/bjp.179.4.335; 10.1016/0140-6736(92)93213-7; 10.1017/S0033291799008983; 10.1017/S0033291798006898; 10.1056/NEJM199902253400803; 10.1093/schbul/sbw052; 10.1192/bjp.184.4.293; 10.1001/archpsyc.58.7.663; 10.1001/archpsyc.63.3.250; 10.1001/archpsyc.58.11.1039; 10.1017/S0033291718000235; 10.1016/j.schres.2009.10.015; 10.1093/schbul/sbi060; 10.1093/schbul/sbs096; 10.1016/j.schres.2008.01.022; 10.1111/eip.12861; 10.1093/epirev/mxn006; 10.1016/j.schres.2015.08.028; 10.1192/bjp.184.4.287; 10.1038/nature09563; 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2010.09.003; 10.1017/S0033291720000355; 10.1016/S2542-5196(20)30004-8; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2017.02.492; 10.4137/EHI.S15664; 10.1016/j.envpol.2018.09.142; 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.09.066; 10.1289/ehp.10464; 10.1289/ehp.6777; 10.1017/S0033291708004534; 10.1017/S0033291716002993; 10.1093/schbul/sbs112; 10.1093/schbul/sbl053; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00634.x; 10.1017/S0033291713000718; 10.1371/journal.pone.0031660; 10.1093/schbul/sbt134; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.0056; 10.1016/S0920-9964(03)00062-8; 10.1093/schbul/sbx060; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.3155; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.14; 10.1017/S0033291705006902; 10.1016/j.dcn.2018.04.004; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.1334; 10.1093/schizbullopen/sgaa009; 10.1016/j.dcn.2017.10.010; 10.1016/j.dcn.2018.03.004; 10.1016/j.jaac.2020.07.003; 10.2105/AJPH.93.7.1137; 10.1016/j.schres.2011.03.029; 10.1016/j.schres.2020.05.045; 10.1101/2021.01.15.21249864; 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.218; 10.1007/s00420-018-1311-x; 10.1016/j.envres.2018.12.019; 10.1192/bjp.184.2.110; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.08.001; 10.1002/wps.20341; 10.1177/0020764013481426; 10.1007/s00127-015-1112-4; 10.1093/schbul/sbs151; 10.1017/S204579601500044X; 10.18637/jss.v067.i01; 10.18637/jss.v048.i02; 10.1207/s15327906mbr3901_4; 10.1080/19312458.2012.679848; 10.2307/2094445; 10.1016/j.schres.2016.10.003; 10.1016/j.tins.2009.05.009; 10.1177/0192623307313011; 10.1155/2012/782462; 10.1093/schbul/sbt085; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.05.023; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.03.013; 10.1016/j.psychres.2013.12.014; 10.1192/bjp.186.5.427; 10.1192/bjp.187.5.401; 10.1017/S0033291714002682; 10.1177/070674371305800107; 10.1093/schbul/sbq120; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.0142; 10.1007/s00127-017-1370-4; 10.1017/S0033291719000485; 10.1007/BF00789219; 10.2307/2095519; 10.1016/j.envint.2021.106905; 10.1289/ehp.1409430","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","Department of Psychology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, United States."

We estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) of risk factors associated with incident cardiovascular events in LMICs. We searched six databases for relevant articles, supplemented with a manual search of reference lists. Articles included in the meta-analyses were those based on prospective community-based cohorts and incorporating adjusted hazard ratios (HR) or relative risks with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for associations between risk factors and a composite cardiovascular and/or stroke endpoint. Pooled HRs and 95% CI were calculated using the random effects model. We assessed heterogeneity using the I<sup>2</sup> test and study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We calculated the PAF of each associated risk factor. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019122741). We identified 18 cohorts from LMICs with 1,125,846 participants, 77,045 composite cardiovascular events and 42,216 strokes. Substantial proportions of incident cardiovascular events were attributable to hypertension (HR [95% CI], 2.23 [2.01-2.48], PAF&#xa0;=&#xa0;28%); current smoking (1.44 [1.31-1.58], PAF&#xa0;=&#xa0;10%); and diabetes mellitus (1.93 [1.67-2.23], PAF&#xa0;=&#xa0;8%). Other risk factors identified included number of children, depression, bone mineral density, and air pollution. A substantial proportion of incident cardiovascular events were linked to traditional metabolic and behavioural modifiable risk factors. However, other novel risk factors also appear to contribute.

This study examined the relationship between SES and academic performance in children and adolescents with CKD. A total of 377 participants aged 6-18&#xa0;years with CKD stages 1-5 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;199), on dialysis (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;43) or with a kidney transplant (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;135) were recruited. Five SES measures and a composite SES index were examined for associations with parent-rated average or above average academic performance in numeracy and literacy using multivariable logistic regression. Participants' median age was 12.6&#xa0;years (IQR 8.9-15.5). Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) (95%CI) for better performance in numeracy and literacy, respectively, were 0.71 (0.44-1.15) and 0.75 (0.45-1.23) for children whose caregivers had lower educational attainment; 0.46 (0.26-0.80) and 0.53 (0.30-0.93) for lower household income; 0.52 (0.32-0.85) and 0.44 (0.26-0.73) for caregivers who were unemployed; 0.68 (0.41-1.12) and 0.59 (0.35-1.00) for caregivers with poor self-rated financial status; and 0.93 (0.53-1.64) and 1.00 (0.56-1.79) for caregivers who did not own their own home.

However, the relationship between parental education and youth suicidal behaviours remains unclear. We explored the association between parental education and youth suicidal ideation and attempts, and examined whether sociocultural contexts moderate such associations. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with a systematic literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO, Medline and Embase from 1900 to December 2020 for studies with participants aged 0-18, and provided quantitative data on the association between parental education and youth suicidal ideation and attempts (death included). Only articles published in English in peer-reviewed journals were considered. Two authors independently assessed eligibility of the articles. One author extracted data [e.g. number of cases and non-cases in each parental education level, effect sizes in forms of odds ratios (ORs) or beta coefficients]. We then calculated pooled ORs using a random-effects model and used moderator analysis to investigate heterogeneity. We included a total of 59 articles (63 study samples, totalling 2 738 374 subjects) in the meta-analysis. Lower parental education was associated with youth suicidal attempts [OR = 1.12, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.04-1.21] but not with suicidal ideation (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.98-1.12). Geographical region and country income level moderated the associations. Lower parental education was associated with an increased risk of youth suicidal attempts in Northern America (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.10-1.45), but with a decreased risk in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.54-0.96). An association of lower parental education and increased risk of youth suicidal ideation was present in high- income countries (HICs) (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.05-1.25), and absent in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.77-1.08). The association between youth suicidal behaviours and parental education seems to differ across geographical and economical contexts, suggesting that cultural, psychosocial or biological factors may play a role in explaining this association. Although there was high heterogeneity in the studies reviewed, this evidence suggests that the role of familial sociodemographic characteristics in youth suicidality may not be universal. This highlights the need to consider cultural, as well as familial factors in the clinical assessment and management of youth's suicidal behaviours in our increasingly multicultural societies, as well as in developing prevention and intervention strategies for youth suicide.",2022,3,30,"Epidemiology and psychiatric sciences","10.1017/S204579602200004X","PMC8967699","Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci","eng","D000293; D002648; D002675; D004522; D006801; D007223; D007231; D010290; D011203; D059020; D013405","Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Educational Status; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Parents; Poverty; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide","MR/S003444/1","NA","The funders had no role in the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis and interpretation of the data; preparation, review or approval of the manuscript and decision to submit the manuscript for publication.","Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."

They support patients and their families through difficult times and improve patient lives. To study the profile of patients availed psychiatric social work services in neurology casualty and emergency settings. The study was retrospective in nature. The ex-post facto research design was used in the study. Data were obtained from a casualty &amp; emergency psychiatric social work referral registry maintained by the psychiatric social work team at the Neurology emergency setting at NIMHANS, Bangalore. Patients referred for psychiatric social work interventions from April 2020 to March 2021 were considered for the study purpose. Frequency and percentages were used to describe the data. Psychiatric social work services at the neurology emergency setting were started in July 2018. Social workers get referrals from triage (four hours to 24 hours), followed by priority ward (72 hours to two weeks), observation ward (72 hours days - two weeks) and emergency ICU. There are 100 beds available for neuro-emergency settings. Of &#x2248;15,939 patients who availed the neurology emergency services, 159 patients were referred for psychiatric social work services. A majority (61.6%) received neuro-education about their illness; awareness about their illness were given to patients and their family members. More than half of them were given guidance for availing treatment welfare benefits under below poverty line and Ayushman Bharath Scheme (54%), 43.3% received supportive psychotherapy, 35.2% pre-discharge counselling, one-third received crisis intervention,12.6% family interventions, 10.7% were facilitated for hospital charges waiver off, few unknown patients management and tracing their family members. Most patients were diagnosed with a stroke, GBS, neuro-infections, and seizure disorder patients who sought psychiatric social work services in emergency and casualty settings. Assessment of their functionality revealed that most were partially independent and dependent. Social workers work from 9 am to 9 pm in the neuro-emergency setting. Immediate social work referrals were made for unknown patients, tracing the caregivers who left the emergency ward without permission, which required financial assistance and communicating poor prognosis (breaking the bad news).

"35302489","Mapping circuit dynamics during function and dysfunction.","Srinivas Gorur-Shandilya, Elizabeth M Cronin, Anna C Schneider, Sara Ann Haddad, Philipp Rosenbaum, Dirk Bucher, Farzan Nadim, Eve Marder","Neural circuits can generate many spike patterns, but only some are functional. The study of how circuits generate and maintain functional dynamics is hindered by a poverty of description of circuit dynamics across functional and dysfunctional states. For example, although the regular oscillation of a central pattern generator is well characterized by its frequency and the phase relationships between its neurons, these metrics are ineffective descriptors of the irregular and aperiodic dynamics that circuits can generate under perturbation or in disease states. By recording the circuit dynamics of the well-studied pyloric circuit in <i>Cancer borealis</i>, we used statistical features of spike times from neurons in the circuit to visualize the spike patterns generated by this circuit under a variety of conditions. This approach captures both the variability of functional rhythms and the diversity of atypical dynamics in a single map. Clusters in the map identify qualitatively different spike patterns hinting at different dynamic states in the circuit. State probability and the statistics of the transitions between states varied with environmental perturbations, removal of descending neuromodulatory inputs, and the addition of exogenous neuromodulators. This analysis reveals strong mechanistically interpretable links between complex changes in the collective behavior of a neural circuit and specific experimental manipulations, and can constrain hypotheses of how circuits generate functional dynamics despite variability in circuit architecture and environmental perturbations.",2022,3,18,"eLife","10.7554/eLife.76579","PMC9000962","Elife","eng","D000818; D003386; D017952; D009474; D018377; D011708","Animals; Brachyura; Ganglia, Invertebrate; Neurons; Neurotransmitter Agents; Pylorus","R01 MH060605; R35 NS097343; T32 NS007292","10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15191.1; 10.7554/eLife.42722; 10.7554/eLife.55470; 10.1242/jeb.109.1.35; 10.1098/rsif.2014.0672; 10.1002/aris.1440370106; 10.1152/jn.01095.2002; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3679-04.2005; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0280-14.2014; 10.1038/s41587-020-00748-9; 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2006.02.023; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0062-04.2004; 10.1016/s0034-5687(01)00308-5; 10.1016/j.cub.2021.09.030; 10.1007/978-3-540-33037-0_14; 10.1038/nn.3776; 10.1016/j.conb.2016.07.005; 10.1152/jn.2001.85.4.1424; 10.1162/neco_a_01097; 10.1152/jn.1982.48.6.1392; 10.1152/jn.1984.51.6.1375; 10.1007/BF00202450; 10.1109/LCSYS.2020.2997214; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0171-15.2015; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.12-03-00810.1992; 10.1162/089976699300016359; 10.1152/jn.00412.2001; 10.7554/eLife.56261; 10.1038/s41598-020-72977-6; 10.3791/1207; 10.1016/j.neuron.2013.01.016; 10.1016/j.neuron.2018.08.035; 10.7554/eLife.41877; 10.1101/sqb.2014.79.024828; 10.1523/ENEURO.0058-14.2015; 10.1146/annurev.ne.14.030191.000351; 10.1242/jeb.62.2.405; 10.1152/jn.00135.2020; 10.1016/0006-8993(84)91138-7; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.07-07-02097.1987; 10.1152/jn.01010.2014; 10.1038/s41467-019-13056-x; 10.1038/s41587-020-00809-z; 10.1038/s41586-019-1892-x; 10.1242/jeb.199190; 10.7554/eLife.56879; 10.1038/s41592-018-0308-4; 10.1137/18m1216134; 10.7554/eLife.38471; 10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.002; 10.1038/415213a; 10.1007/978-1-4757-5858-0_17; 10.1002/cne.902430403; 10.1016/B978-0-08-041986-2.50006-0; 10.1146/annurev.physiol.69.031905.161516; 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.09.010; 10.1038/nn1391; 10.21105/joss.00861; 10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.188101; 10.1152/jn.1982.48.6.1416; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.21-18-07331.2001; 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006907; 10.1242/jeb.135.1.165; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.09-05-01591.1989; 10.1016/j.neuron.2014.04.002; 10.1101/061507; 10.1016/j.cub.2016.05.029; 10.1093/mnras/202.3.615; 10.7554/eLife.60454; 10.1152/jn.00641.2003; 10.1038/nn1352; 10.1242/jeb.02709; 10.1016/j.bpj.2021.01.038; 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002857; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2632-17.2018; 10.1016/0006-8993(76)90482-0; 10.1016/S0925-2312(02)00838-X; 10.1038/nn1639; 10.1073/pnas.0705827104; 10.1109/INFVIS.2001.963283; 10.1152/jn.00986.2007; 10.1038/nn.3947; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.20-18-06752.2000; 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000469; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1443-12.2012; 10.1152/jn.00764.2005; 10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.224101; 10.1371/journal.pone.0006742; 10.1152/jn.1993.69.6.1993; 10.1126/science.8178157; 10.1162/089976601300014321; 10.1126/science.274.5293.1724; 10.1088/0954-898X_8_2_003; 10.1146/annurev-neuro-092619-094115; 10.23915/distill.00002; 10.1016/j.neuron.2018.05.015","SG, EC, AS, SH, PR, DB, FN, EM No competing interests declared","Volen Center and Biology Department, Brandeis University, Waltham, United States."

The Allostatic Load (AL) is a measure of multisystem dysregulation, resulted by chronic stress. We systematically reviewed the English language literature on the association between ACEs and AL to identify the clinical risk profile, with the exclusion of reviews and preclinical studies. Searches covered the publication period up to the 1<sup>st</sup> of February 2022 and identified 25 studies in which ACEs such as maltreatment, abuse, poverty, psychological abuse, and discrimination were investigated in the context of AL. The selected studies used different sets of AL biomarkers resulting in substantial heterogenicity of calculating the AL index. Overall, we found that ACEs are associated with elevated AL and poorer health outcomes in adulthood. Furthermore, health risk behaviors, social support, and coping resources either moderate or mediate this association. These findings suggest that targeting individuals at risk and starting interventions early might reduce AL and its deleterious health consequences.",2022,5,1,"Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews","10.1016/j.neubiorev.2022.104605",NA,"Neurosci Biobehav Rev","eng","D000328; D000076783; D052636; D002648; D002649; D006801; D012944","Adult; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Allostasis; Child; Child Abuse; Humans; Social Support",NA,"NA",NA,"College of Medicine and Dentistry, James Cook University, Townsville, Queensland, Australia."
"35266751","Socioeconomic disparities and neuroplasticity: Moving toward adaptation, intersectionality, and inclusion.","Kimberly G Noble, Emma R Hart, Jessica F Sperber","Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has far-reaching linkages with children's cognitive and socioemotional development, academic achievement, health, and brain structure and function. Rather than focusing on understandings about the neuroscience of socioeconomic inequality that have recently been reviewed elsewhere, the present article reviews several new directions in the field, beginning first with a consideration of the deficit versus adaptation framework. Although scientists largely agree that socioeconomic disparities in brain development are experience-dependent phenomena rooted in neuroplasticity, historically, such differences have been framed as deficits, which may benefit from intervention. However, emerging research suggests that some developmental differences among children experiencing adversity may alternatively be considered context-appropriate adaptations to the individual's environment. We next discuss how socioeconomic circumstances are inextricably intertwined with race, and consider how measurement of racism and discrimination must be part of a full understanding of the neuroscience of socioeconomic inequality. We argue that scientists must consciously recruit racially and socioeconomically diverse samples-and include measures of SES, race, and discrimination in analyses-to promote a more complete understanding of the neuroplasticity specifically, and psychological science more broadly. We discuss the extent to which researcher and editor positionality have contributed to these problems historically, and conclude by considering paths forward.

A prospective study was conducted in seven counties of Jilin Province from 2010 to 2020. Adult women diagnosed with convulsive epilepsy were recruited into the study and baseline demographics recorded upon enrollment. Seizure frequency, prescribed drug dose, and adverse reactions were monitored monthly by door-to-door survey or telephone interview. A total of 1,333 women were included in the study. During the follow-up period, 169 participants (12.7%) were lost to follow-up, and 100 of them (7.5%) died. The percentage of seizure-free participants was 45.3% in the first year, 74.6% in the third year, and 96.6% in the 10th year. A higher baseline seizure frequency (OR = 1.005, 95% CI: 1.002-1.009), more frequent loss-of-consciousness seizures (OR = 1.620, 95% CI: 1.318-1.990), a higher daily dose of PB in the first year (OR = 1.018, 95% CI: 1.014-1.022), a younger age at onset (OR = 0.990, 95% CI: 0.982-0.998), and more severe drowsiness (OR = 1.727, 95% CI: 1.374-2.173) were associated with an increased risk of seizures in the first year, and the higher baseline seizure frequency was still associated with the occurrence of seizures in the third (OR = 1.007, 95% CI: 1.004-1.010) and fifth year (OR = 1.005, 95% CI: 1.002-1.008). Age at enrollment (HR = 0.983, 95% CI: 0.971-0.994) was the only factor that correlated with withdrawal from the study and with the death of the participant during the follow up period, but the correlation in each case was in opposite directions. PB has high effectiveness, retention rate, mild side effects, and tolerability when used as a treatment for epilepsy in women from rural areas. Baseline seizure frequency is an important predictor of prognosis regardless of treatment duration. PB is still a valuable tool for the management of epilepsy in adult women from poverty-stricken areas.",2022,1,1,"Frontiers in neurology","10.3389/fneur.2022.838098","PMC8889069","Front Neurol","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60456-6; 10.1212/WNL.0000000000003509; 10.1016/j.expneurol.2014.04.009; 10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2009.03.003; 10.1111/epi.12969; 10.1016/j.pbb.2016.07.002; 10.1016/j.seizure.2011.07.007; 10.1111/j.1528-1157.2000.tb00285.x; 10.1016/j.phrs.2016.03.003; 10.1212/WNL.0b013e31822cfc90; 10.1046/j.1528-1157.2001.32800.x; 10.2471/BLT.09.064147; 10.1212/01.wnl.0000059867.35547.de; 10.1016/j.seizure.2014.01.007; 10.1016/s1474-4422(05)70254-4; 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2005.00402.x; 10.1111/epi.12026; 10.1111/epi.12027; 10.1124/pr.119.017392; 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2005.51204.x; 10.1023/a:1015953715346; 10.1016/s0140-6736(00)04516-5; 10.1111/epi.12022; 10.1111/j.1600-0404.2012.01711.x; 10.1212/wnl.56.11.1445; 10.1016/j.neurol.2015.01.563; 10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2020.106480; 10.1093/brain/awz170; 10.1016/s1474-4422(16)30295-2; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2015.11.007; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2013.06.029; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2005.11.002; 10.1056/NEJM199002083220604; 10.1111/j.1528-1157.1996.tb00516.x; 10.1111/j.1600-0404.1983.tb01535.x; 10.1016/j.clineuro.2009.10.011; 10.1097/WCO.0000000000000659; 10.1016/j.seizure.2021.05.006; 10.1016/j.seizure.2019.06.012; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107634; 10.1111/epi.13744; 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2005.00406.x; 10.1212/WNL.0b013e318223c784","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","Department of Neurology, Neuroscience Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China."
"35248821","Exploring neural correlates of behavioral and academic resilience among children in poverty.","M E Ellwood-Lowe, C N Irving, S A Bunge","Children in poverty must contend with systems that do not meet their needs. We explored what, at a neural level, helps explain children's resilience in these contexts. Lower coupling between lateral frontoparietal network (LFPN) and default mode network (DMN)-linked, respectively, to externally- and internally-directed thought-has previously been associated with better cognitive performance. However, we recently found the opposite pattern for children in poverty. Here, we probed ecologically-valid assessments of performance. In a pre-registered study, we investigated trajectories of network coupling over ages 9-13 and their relation to school grades and attention problems. We analyzed longitudinal data from ABCD Study (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;8366 children at baseline; 1303 below poverty). The link between cognitive performance and grades was weaker for children in poverty, highlighting the importance of ecologically-valid measures. As predicted, higher LFPN-DMN connectivity was linked to worse grades and attentional problems for children living above poverty, while children below poverty showed opposite tendencies. This interaction between LFPN-DMN connectivity and poverty related to children's grades two years later; however, it was attenuated when controlling for baseline grades and was not related to attention longitudinally. Together, these findings suggest network connectivity is differentially related to performance in real-world settings for children above and below poverty.",2022,4,1,"Developmental cognitive neuroscience","10.1016/j.dcn.2022.101090","PMC8899231","Dev Cogn Neurosci","eng","D000293; D001288; D001921; D001931; D002648; D006801; D008279; D009434; D011203","Adolescent; Attention; Brain; Brain Mapping; Child; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Pathways; Poverty","U01 DA041048; U01 DA050989; U01 DA051016; U01 DA041022; U01 DA051018; U01 DA051037; U01 DA050987; U01 DA041174; U01 DA041106; U01 DA041117; U01 DA041028; U01 DA041134; U01 DA050988; U01 DA051039; U01 DA041156; U01 DA041025; U01 DA041120; U01 DA051038; U01 DA041148; U01 DA041093; U01 DA041089; U24 DA041123; U24 DA041147","10.1542/pir.21-8-265; 10.1080/10400419.2018.1411423; 10.1016/j.dcn.2017.10.010; 10.18637/jss.v067.i01; 10.1016/j.tics.2015.10.004; 10.1016/j.bandc.2016.12.004; 10.1038/s41583-019-0212-7; 10.1016/j.cobeha.2015.11.018; 10.1016/j.dcn.2018.03.001; 10.1371/journal.pone.0190073; 10.1162/jocn_a_00517; 10.1073/pnas.0900234106; 10.1038/nrn2005; 10.1111/cdev.13504; 10.1002/cne.901230110; 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2014.05.024; 10.1073/pnas.1803276115; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.08.025; 10.1038/s41467-021-27336-y; 10.1111/desc.12450; 10.1073/pnas.1204185109; 10.1002/hbm.460030303; 10.1016/j.dcn.2018.04.004; 10.1093/cercor/bhu239; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.01.079; 10.1177/1073858414524442; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116091; 10.1136/adc.2004.059006; 10.1038/s41598-017-15795-7; 10.1038/npp.2014.165; 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00134; 10.1038/s41467-021-22027-0; 10.1016/j.dcn.2019.100641; 10.1073/pnas.0807041106; 10.1093/cercor/bhz255; 10.1016/j.dcn.2018.02.006; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4141-12.2013; 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002328; 10.1073/pnas.2105304118; 10.1016/S0018-506X(02)00024-7; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.10.012; 10.1111/cdep.12305; 10.1002/icd.2286; 10.1101/2021.07.07.451458; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.08.048; 10.1016/j.neuron.2014.09.007; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.10.044; 10.1073/pnas.98.2.676; 10.1016/j.bpsc.2021.03.008; 10.1016/j.dcn.2021.101005; 10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043152; 10.1073/pnas.1902932116; 10.1007/s00426-014-0617-x; 10.1371/journal.pone.0035744; 10.1016/j.dcn.2014.08.002; 10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00145; 10.1177/1745691619827511; 10.1073/pnas.0800005105; 10.1038/s41583-021-00457-5; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4465-11.2011; 10.1152/jn.90355.2008; 10.31234/osf.io/8nhej; 10.1038/nn1727; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.4208; 10.1146/annurev-economics-080218-025852",NA,"Department of Psychology, University of California, Berkeley, USA; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley, USA."

We investigated early-life family composition and parental socio-economic status (SES) as OCD risk factors while stratifying for sex in a sample of 1,154,067 individuals from the Danish population (7550 of whom had OCD). Data on early-life family composition (birth order, number of siblings, number of parents in household at proband age 6), parental SES at age 6 (parental income, occupation, and education level), history of parental psychiatric illness, and parental age at birth on OCD risk (i.e., an ICD-10 diagnosis of F42.x) were obtained from Danish population registers. Survival analyses using Cox regression were performed with age as the underlying time variable. Analyses were adjusted for calendar time, and differential effect by sex was tested for exposures. We found that birth order and advanced maternal age were risk factors for OCD in males, and being an only child was associated with increased OCD risk in both sexes. Early childhood SES variables including parental education, occupation, and income were associated with OCD risk, and these effects were more pronounced in females. Significant interaction effects for parental education/occupation and the presence of non-OCD psychiatric diagnoses in the proband also emerged. Our results suggest that early-life SES and family composition may be important risk factors for OCD, and heterogeneity in OCD cases in terms of psychiatric comorbidities, as well as sex differences should be carefully examined in relation to risk factors.",2022,5,1,"Journal of psychiatric research","10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.02.004","PMC9627644","J Psychiatr Res","eng","D002648; D002675; D003718; D000078022; D005260; D006801; D007231; D008297; D009771; D010290; D012307","Child; Child, Preschool; Denmark; Economic Status; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder; Parents; Risk Factors","R01 MH119084; K01 MH109782; U01 MH109536; R01 MH120170; R01 MH124871; R01 MH105500; R01 MH110427; U01 MH109528","NA",NA,"National Centre for Register-based Research, Aarhus BSS, Aarhus University, Aarhus, 8210, Denmark; Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative Psychiatric Research (iPSYCH), Aarhus University, Aarhus, 8000, Denmark; Centre for Integrated Register-based Research (CIRRAU), Aarhus University, Aarhus, 8210, Denmark."

Adolescents are vulnerable to the stress of the pandemic, and may experience indicators of psychological distress, such as depression. This study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19-related stressors on depression and the mediating role of life history strategies. A two-wave longitudinal study was conducted with 1123 adolescents (51.20% girls, M<sub>age</sub>&#xa0;=&#xa0;14.30) recruited from three junior high schools in the Northeastern province of China. Adolescents' life history strategies, depressive symptoms, and demographic variables were assessed at Time 1 (November 2019) and Time 2 (August 2020), and adolescents' experience of COVID-19-related stressors was assessed at Time 2. None of participants was infected by COVID-19 virus. COVID-19-related stressors were positively associated with depressive symptoms at Time 2 (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.08, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01), after controlling for gender, age, SES and depressive symptoms at Time 1. And life history strategies partially mediated the relation of pandemic stress to depression (indirect effect&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05, 95% CI [0.004, 0.034]). There were no gender differences in the relations between stress on depression. The sample was from a district where the pandemic was not very severe, which may limit generalizability of the results. This study revealed that COVID-19-related stressors may have a long-term impact on adolescents, increasing depression through speeding up their life history strategies.

Knowledge of the sociodemographic and clinical factors predicting clozapine response may be useful in developing personalised approaches to treatment. This retrospective cohort study used data from the electronic health records of the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) hospital between 2007 and 2011. Using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression statistical learning approach, we examined 35 sociodemographic and clinical factors' predictive ability of response to clozapine at 3 months of treatment. Response was assessed by the level of change in the severity of the symptoms using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. We identified 242 service-users with a treatment-resistant psychotic disorder who had their first trial of clozapine and continued the treatment for at least 3 months. The LASSO regression identified three predictors of response to clozapine: higher severity of illness at baseline, female gender and having a comorbid mood disorder. These factors are estimated to explain 18% of the variance in clozapine response. The model's optimism-corrected calibration slope was 1.37, suggesting that the model will underfit when applied to new data. These findings suggest that women, people with a comorbid mood disorder and those who are most ill at baseline respond better to clozapine. However, the accuracy of the internally validated and recalibrated model was low. Therefore, future research should indicate whether a prediction model developed by including routinely collected data, in combination with biological information, presents adequate predictive ability to be applied in clinical settings.",2022,4,1,"Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)","10.1177/02698811221078746","PMC9066692","J Psychopharmacol","eng","D014150; D003024; D005260; D006801; D011618; D012189; D012559","Antipsychotic Agents; Clozapine; Female; Humans; Psychotic Disorders; Retrospective Studies; Schizophrenia","MR/L017105/1","10.1192/bjp.2021.61","<b>Authors&#x2019; Note:</b> Nikolaj Bak is now affiliated to Cyclerion Therapeutics, Massachusetts, USA. <b>Declaration of conflicting interests:</b> The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: DFdF, GKS, EF and IR have received research funding from Janssen and H.

"35201791","Attachment insecurity moderates emotion responses to mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation in adults raised in low socioeconomic status households.","Taylor N West, Brian P Don, Barbara L Fredrickson","Research on attachment theory holds that insecure attachment influences people's daily social and emotional experiences. Mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness meditation have been associated with improvements in physical and mental well-being often through their influence on emotion experience and regulation. Yet, little research has examined how emotional well-being may be improved in insecurely attached individuals through meditation practice. We suspected that the emotion profiles of anxious and avoidant attachment may shift with meditation training, both across time and on a particular day. Improving emotional well-being may be especially consequential for those most at risk for negative health outcomes in late life. A diverse community sample of midlife adults raised in low-SES homes (<i>N</i> = 113; 55% white, 87.5% female) completed daily emotion reports for 10 weeks, during which they received 6 weeks of meditation training, randomized to either loving-kindness or mindfulness meditation practice. Results from growth curve analyses revealed that individuals with greater attachment anxiety and randomized to mindfulness meditation reported significant increases over time in positive emotions alongside decreases in negative emotions. Those high in attachment avoidance reported significant decreases in negative emotions in both meditation groups. On the daily level, within-person dose-response analyses revealed that individuals with greater attachment anxiety showed the most consistent dose-response relations between the duration of either meditation practice and same-day increases in positive emotions and decreases in negative emotions. These findings highlight how meditation interventions can shift emotion profiles of insecurely attached midlife adults who are at heightened risk for late life chronic illnesses.

"35197336","Role of mHealth applications for emergency medical system activation in reducing mortality in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review protocol.","Dylan Griswold, Andres M Rubiano","Prehospital care is an essential component in reducing mortality for patients presenting with emergency medical conditions. Prehospital systems tend to be underdeveloped or non-existent in these areas, with less than 1% of low-income and middle-income country (LMIC) populations served by an organised prehospital system. Mobile health apps for activation of Emergency Medical System (EMS) have been shown to decrease mortality, but there has yet to be a systematic review and meta-analysis performed to clarify the role that these apps play in reducing mortality in LMICs. The objective of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of mobile health apps for EMS activation versus traditional EMS dispatches in survival and transport time in patients with emergency medical conditions. The proposed systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised controlled trials (NRCTs) will be conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews of effectiveness evidence. MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and EBSCO will be searched from January 2005 to March 2021. The search results will be presented according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram. Primary outcomes will include mortality and transport time. Critical appraisal will be assessed using the JBI SUMARI Risk-of-Bias Tool for RCTs, and Risk-of-Bias In Non-Randomised Studies tool for NRCTs. A narrative synthesis will be conducted for all included studies. If sufficient data are available, a meta-analysis will be conducted. I<sup>2</sup> statistics will be used to assess heterogeneity and identify their potential sources. No ethical approval will be required, as this review is based on already published data and does not involve interaction with human subjects.

At the same time, early-life conditions affect neural function and structure, suggesting the brain may be a conduit for the biological embedding of SES. Here, we investigate the brain anatomy signatures of SES in a large-scale population cohort aged 45-85&#x2009;years. We assess both gray matter morphometry and tissue properties indicative of myelin content. Higher life course SES is associated with increased volume in several brain regions, including postcentral and temporal gyri, cuneus, and cerebellum. We observe more widespread volume differences and higher myelin content in the sensorimotor network but lower myelin content in the temporal lobe associated with childhood SES. Crucially, childhood SES differences persisted in adult brains even after controlling for adult SES, highlighting the unique contribution of early-life conditions to brain anatomy, independent of later changes in SES.

The present study examines how NLE and associated urban features (e.g., air pollution, low green space) impact mental and physical wellbeing. We included 200,393 UK Biobank Cohort participants with complete data. The study was carried out in two steps. In Step1, we assessed the relationship between NLE, deprivation, pollution, green space, household poverty and mental and physical symptoms. In Step2, we examined the role of NLE on environment-symptom networks. We stratified participants into high and low NLE and used gaussian graphical model to identify nodes which bridged urban features and mental and physical health problems. We then compared the global strength of these networks in high vs low NLE. We found that higher NLE associated with higher air pollution, less green space, higher economic and neighborhood deprivation, higher household poverty and higher depressed mood, higher tiredness/lethargy and obesity (R<sub>training_mean</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.2624, <i>P</i> <sub>training_mean</sub>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001; R<sub>test_mean</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.2619, <i>P</i> <sub>test_mean</sub>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). We also found that the interaction between environmental risk factors and mental, physical problems (overall network connectivity) was higher in the high NLE network than in the low NLE network (t&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.7896, <i>P</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). In areas with high NLE, economic deprivation, household poverty and waist circumference acted as bridge factors between the key urban features and mental health symptoms. In conclusion, NLE, urban features, household poverty and mental and physical symptoms are all interrelated. In areas with high NLE, urban features associate with mental and physical health problems at a greater magnitude than in areas with low NLE.

Among adolescents, it is estimated that for every suicide, there are 100-200 suicide attempts. Although 79% of suicides in the world occur in low/middle-income countries, most of scientific evidence comes from high-income and low-risk countries. In recent years, adolescent suicide rates have steadily increased in Chile. Deaths caused by self-harm increased by 220% in the population aged 10-19 years between 2000 and 2015. The Maule Region is one of the regions of Chile with the highest levels of suicide among those aged 15 and 19 years old. The objective of this study is to evaluate the trajectories of ideation and suicidal attempts in adolescents with psychiatric disorders treated within the public health system of the Maule Region, Chile, based on different clinical, psychological and neuropsychological factors. A prospective naturalistic study of a clinical sample of adolescents under psychiatric treatment in the Maule Region, Chile. Adolescents will be evaluated using a thorough protocol that includes suicide-related clinical variables. The study seeks to establish patterns of change in the trajectories of ideation and suicide attempts among adolescents. Ethical approval was granted by the Scientific Ethics Committee of the Universidad Cat&#xf3;lica del Maule in Chile. This protocol was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov. The results of this study will be disseminated to health centres through executive reports and feedback sessions. In addition, the most relevant findings will be presented in scientific articles, conferences and seminars open to the community.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of the work documenting this association has been conducted in high-income countries. It is not yet known whether the mechanisms found to mediate this association would generalize to children in low- and middle-income countries, where the risks of exposure to extreme poverty and a wide range of both biological and psychosocial hazards may be greater. We examined relations among early adversity, neural correlates of inhibitory control, and cognitive outcomes in 154 5-year-old children living in Dhaka, Bangladesh, an area with a high prevalence of poverty. Participants completed a go/no-go task assessing inhibitory control and their behavioral and event-related potential responses were assessed. Cortical source analysis was performed. We collected measures of poverty, malnutrition, maternal mental health, psychosocial adversity, and cognitive skills. Supporting studies in high-income countries, children in this sample exhibited a longer N2 latency and higher P3 amplitude to the no-go versus go condition. Unexpectedly, children had a more pronounced N2 amplitude during go trials than no-go trials. The N2 latency was related to their behavioral accuracy on the go/no-go task. The P3 mean amplitude, behavioral accuracy, and reaction time during the task were all associated with intelligence-quotient (IQ) scores.

"35162672","The Association between Stressful Life Events and Emotional and Behavioral Problems in Children 0-7 Years Old: The CIKEO Study.","Yuan Fang, Hein Raat, Dafna A Windhorst, Irene N Fierloos, Harrie Jonkman, Clemens M H Hosman, Matty R Crone, Wilma Jansen, Amy van Grieken","Stressful life events (SLEs) are recognized risk factors for emotional and behavioral problems, but the association is understudied among young children. Our aim was to examine the association between exposure to SLEs and emotional and behavioral problems in young children up to 7 years old. We analyzed baseline data from 959 children (mean age = 3.3 years; SD = 1.9; 47.5% girls) in the CIKEO study, a community-based longitudinal study in the Netherlands. Linear regression was used to assess the associations between the total as well as the individual exposure to SLEs experienced in the past 12 months, and emotional and behavioral problems assessed by CBCL 1.5-5. Interactions of SLEs and child age, sex, ethnic background, and socioeconomic status were explored. Higher total exposure to SLEs, as indicated by the number of SLEs, was significantly associated with higher CBCL total, internalizing and externalizing problem scores (<i>p</i> for trend &lt; 0.05). The results did not differ by child age, sex, ethnic background, or family SES.

"35150413","Endovascular Therapy for Symptomatic Intracranial Artery Stenosis: a Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.","Tao Wang, Kun Yang, Xiao Zhang, Jichang Luo, Ran Xu, Xue Wang, Yutong Yang, Xuesong Bai, Yan Ma,  ..., Liqun Jiao","Intracranial artery atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) is one of the most common causes of stroke. Endovascular therapy including balloon angioplasty alone (BA), balloon-mounted stent (BMS), or self-expanding stent (SES) was an important alternative to treat symptomatic ICAS refractory to medical treatment, while none of the three subtypes has been established to be the primary option. We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to determine both the safety and efficacy and establish a hierarchy of different endovascular therapies on symptomatic ICAS. Major databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies comparing outcomes of three different endovascular approaches and other comparable non-endovascular therapies for symptomatic ICAS patients published from 1 January 2000 to 1 November 2021. Primary outcomes included short-term mortality or stroke rate (peri-procedural, or mean follow-up&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;3&#xa0;months), and long-term mortality or stroke rate (mean follow-up&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;6&#xa0;months). Pairwise and network meta-analyses based on the above systematic review were conducted. A total of 19 eligible studies involving 3386 patients treated with 4 different approaches (BA, SES, BMS, and medical treatment) were analyzed. For primary outcome, BA had the highest ranking (SUCRA value 78), followed by BMS (SUCRA value 21.5) and SES (SUCRA value 13.1). The short-term mortality or stroke rate was significantly lower in the BA group compared to SES (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.50; 95% CI 1.12 to 5.57; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.026) or BMS (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.43; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.96; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.038). Other primary and secondary outcomes were no different among all three types of endovascular therapy. Overall, the studies were of good methodological quality and the consistency was acceptable across all network meta-analyses. BA offers the highest level of safety outcomes in terms of short-term mortality or stroke in treating symptomatic patients with intracranial artery stenosis, compared to SES and BMS, which needs to be confirmed in future studies.

One challenge of studying reward processing in the field of developmental neuroscience is finding a task that activates reward circuitry, and is short, not too complex, and engaging for youth of a wide variety of ages and socioeconomic backgrounds. In the present study, we tested a brief child-friendly reward task for activating reward circuitry in two independent samples of youth ages 7-19 years old enriched for poverty (study 1: n = 464; study 2: n = 27). The reward task robustly activated the ventral striatum, with activation decreasing from early to mid-adolescence and increasing from mid- to late adolescence in response to reward. This response did not vary by gender, pubertal development, or income-to-needs ratio, making the task applicable for a wide variety of populations. Additionally, ventral striatum activation to the task did not differ between youth who did and did not expect to receive a prize at the end of the task, indicating that an outcome of points alone may be enough to engage reward circuitry. Thus, this reward task is effective for studying reward processing in youth from different socioeconomic backgrounds.",2022,1,1,"PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0263368","PMC8812963","PLoS One","eng","D000293; D000367; D001921; D001931; D002648; D005260; D005581; D006801; D008279; D008297; D009042; D009488; D011203; D012201; D012923; D066328; D055815","Adolescent; Age Factors; Brain; Brain Mapping; Child; Female; Foster Home Care; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Motivation; Neurosciences; Poverty; Reward; Social Class; Ventral Striatum; Young Adult","T32 HD007109; UH2 HD087979; RC1 DK086376; R01 DK098983; S10 OD012240; UG3 MH114249; R01 HD093334; R01 HD061356; R21 DK090718","10.3389/neuro.09.006.2010; 10.1111/jcpp.12502; 10.1097/WNR.0b013e3281532bd7; 10.1111/cdev.13056; 10.1006/nimg.2000.0593; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.03.004; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.21-16-j0002.2001; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3446-06.2006; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.03.014; 10.1093/scan/nsv124; 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.02.007; 10.1073/pnas.1310134110; 10.1017/S0140525X0999152X; 10.1007/s40167-014-0024-6; 10.1177/0013124516644053; 10.1177/1088868316644094; 10.2174/1874440000903010058; 10.1111/jora.12408; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1834-17.2017; 10.1002/hbm.24370; 10.1097/00004583-201002000-00010; 10.1016/j.dcn.2011.06.003; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.12.016; 10.1002/hbm.24184; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.07.083; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2431-05.2005; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.03.023; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.07.030; 10.1017/thg.2012.87; 10.1017/thg.2019.57; 10.1375/183242706779462868; 10.1016/j.appet.2013.10.016; 10.1016/j.dcn.2018.03.001; 10.1109/42.906424; 10.1016/s1053-8119(03)00169-1; 10.1006/cbmr.1996.0014; 10.1111/j.1469-8986.2007.00594.x; 10.1007/BF01537962; 10.1002/mrm.1910330508; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116189; 10.1016/j.dcn.2012.08.004; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117872; 10.1177/0956797620916786; 10.1101/2021.10.08.463750v1; 10.1101/2021.10.08.463750; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.01.129; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1062-06.2006; 10.1016/j.dcn.2014.01.005; 10.1073/pnas.1316911111; 10.1016/j.bbr.2015.04.008; 10.1093/scan/nsn051; 10.1093/scan/nsaa157; 10.1016/j.brainres.2006.06.072; 10.2307/1130220; 10.1037/0012-1649.26.2.322; 10.1038/s41593-021-00867-9","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America."

To date, an exploration of such factors in patients with cervical spine surgery has not been conducted. The objective of the current work was to 1) define the social risk phenotypes of individuals who have undergone cervical spine surgery for myelopathy and 2) analyze their predictive capacity toward disability, pain, quality of life, and patient satisfaction-based outcomes. The Cervical Myelopathy Quality Outcomes Database was queried for the period from January 2016 to December 2018. Race/ethnicity, educational attainment, SES, insurance payer, and employment status were modeled into unique social phenotypes using latent class analyses. Proportions of social groups were analyzed for demonstrating a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 30% from baseline for disability, neck and arm pain, quality of life, and patient satisfaction at the 3-month and 1-year follow-ups. A total of 730 individuals who had undergone cervical myelopathy surgery were included in the final cohort. Latent class analysis identified 2 subgroups: 1) high risk (non-White race and ethnicity, lower educational attainment, not working, poor insurance, and predominantly lower SES), n = 268, 36.7% (class 1); and 2) low risk (White, employed with good insurance, and higher education and SES), n = 462, 63.3% (class 2). For both 3-month and 1-year outcomes, the high-risk group (class 1) had decreased odds (all p &lt; 0.05) of attaining an MCID score in disability, neck/arm pain, and health-related quality of life. Being in the low-risk group (class 2) resulted in an increased odds of attaining an MCID score in disability, neck/arm pain, and health-related quality of life. Neither group had increased or decreased odds of being satisfied with surgery. Although 2 groups underwent similar surgical approaches, the social phenotype involving non-White race/ethnicity, poor insurance, lower SES, and poor employment did not meet MCIDs for a variety of outcome measures. This finding should prompt surgeons to proactively incorporate socially conscience care pathways within healthcare systems, as well as to optimize community-based resources to improve outcomes and personalize care for populations at social risk.",2022,1,28,"Journal of neurosurgery.

Levetiracetam (LEV) is a third-generation anti-seizure medication (ASM) widely used in BTRE prophylaxis. The study evaluated LEV neuropsychiatric side effects (SEs) in BTRE prophylaxis. <b>Method:</b> Twenty-eight patients with brain tumors were retrospectively selected and divided into two groups. In one group, we evaluated patients with a BTRE diagnosis using LEV (BTRE-group). The other group included patients with brain tumors who never had epilepsy and used a prophylactic ASM regimen with LEV (PROPHYLAXIS-group). Neuropsychiatric SEs of LEV were monitored using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) at the baseline visit and the 6- and 12-month follow-up. <b>Results:</b> Eighteen patients of the BTRE-group and 10 patients of the PROPHYLAXIS-group were included. Compared to the BTRE-group, the PROPHYLAXIS-group showed a higher severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms.

The model partitions individuals' data into two phases, known as regimes, with: (1) a zero-inflation regime that is used to accommodate high instances of zeros (non-drinking) and (2) a multilevel Poisson regression regime in which variations in individuals' log-transformed average rates of alcohol use are captured by means of an autoregressive process with exogenous predictors and a person-specific intercept. The times at which individuals are in each regime are unknown, but may be estimated from the data. We assume that the regime indicator follows a first-order Markov process as related to exogenous predictors of interest. The forecast performance of the proposed model was evaluated using a Monte Carlo simulation study and further demonstrated using substance use and spatial covariate data from the Colorado Online Twin Study (CoTwins). Results showed that the proposed model yielded better forecast performance compared to a baseline model which predicted all cases as non-drinking and a reduced ZIMLP model without the RS structure, as indicated by higher AUC (the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve) scores, and lower mean absolute errors (MAEs) and root-mean-square errors (RMSEs). The improvements in forecast performance were even more pronounced when we limited the comparisons to participants who showed at least one instance of transition to drinking.",2022,6,1,"Psychometrika","10.1007/s11336-021-09831-9","PMC9177551","Psychometrika","eng","D000293; D001499; D006801; D015233; D016012; D011594; D000066608","Adolescent; Bayes Theorem; Humans; Models, Statistical; Poisson Distribution; Psychometrics; Underage Drinking","IGE-1806874; UL TR000127; BCS-1052736; SES-1823633; P2C HD041025; U24AA027684; UL1 TR000127; U24 AA027684; U01DA046413 (SV/NF); UL1 TR002014; U01 DA046413","10.1037/a0038962; 10.18637/jss.v078.i10; 10.3758/s13428-018-1101-0; 10.1214/15-AOAS846; 10.1521/jscp.2017.36.3.238; 10.1007/s11222-016-9649-y; 10.1080/00273171.2019.1627659; 10.5281/zenodo.4672651; 10.35566/jbds/v1n2/p5",NA,"Department of Agricultural Economics, Sociology, and Education, The Pennsylvania State University, PA 16802, State College, USA."

However, little is known about the association between occupational factors and cognition in early adulthood, especially when controlling for early life socioeconomic status (SES) and cognition in childhood. Importantly, sex may shape the impact of occupational characteristics that provide cognitive stimulation given that education, occupational status, and workplace experiences differ by sex. Using data on 12,129 participants ages 24-32 from the U.S.-based National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we investigated the association between four factors of occupational cognitive stimulation (repetition, freedom, analytic skills, and social interaction) and young-adult episodic and working memory independent of childhood and young-adult SES, using linear regression. We adjusted for confounding due to sex, race/ethnicity, age, childhood cognition, and education. We further investigated effect measure modification of this association by sex in stratified regression models. Overall, 1-unit increases in both occupational analytic skills and social interaction were significantly associated with 0.101 (95%CI: 0.28, 0.173) and 0.096 (95%CI: 0.032, 0.160) SD higher memory, respectively. However, when sex-stratified, among men, a 1-unit increase on the social interaction scale was associated with 0.16 (95%CI: 0.05, 0.27) SD higher memory, while there was no association among women. Our results indicate that even in adulthood, activities that stimulate the mind can contribute to improved cognitive function, and the most beneficial forms of occupational stimulation are those that use analytic skills and involve social interaction (particularly among young men).",2022,3,1,"SSM - population health","10.1016/j.ssmph.2022.101024","PMC8762043","SSM Popul Health","eng",NA,NA,"P2C HD050924; R01 AG057800","NA",NA,"Department of Psychiatry &amp; Behavioral Science, School of Medicine, Duke University, Duke University Medical Center, Box 3950, Durham, NC, 27710, USA."

PSMDs are well documented in high-income countries. However, much less is known about the prevalence of PSMDs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The aim was to review the available literature systematically and estimate the prevalence of PSMDs among women in LMICs. We searched the Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Maternity and Infant Care databases systematically from the date of inception to Dec 31, 2020, for English-language publications with data on the prevalence of PSMDs among women in World Bank-defined LMICs. Selection of studies, extraction of data and assessment of study quality were each undertaken independently by at least two of the investigators. A total of five studies (completed in three countries spanning two continents) met the inclusion criteria. Five studies reported cumulative incidence of postpartum psychosis (ranging from 1.1 to 16.7 per 1000 births). We found no studies on the prevalence of severe mental disorder during pregnancy in these settings. Marked heterogeneity in methodology precluded meta-analysis. These findings indicate that PSMDs occur at a similar prevalence in low- and middle-income to high-income countries. However overall, there is a paucity of high-quality evidence from these settings. There is a need for rigorous studies with standardized methods to increase knowledge of the nature, prevalence, and determinants of PSMDs among women in resource-constrained LMICs to inform policies, service development, program planning and health professional training.",2022,4,1,"Archives of women's mental health","10.1007/s00737-021-01201-9","PMC8921056","Arch Womens Ment Health","eng","D003906; D005260; D006801; D007182; D001523; D058725; D011203; D011247","Developing Countries; Female; Humans; Income; Mental Disorders; Peripartum Period; Poverty; Pregnancy",NA,"10.1007/s12098-012-0763-3; 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2004.00063.x; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2014.13121652; 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)15390-1; 10.1007/s00737-016-0684-7; 10.1007/s00737-007-0179-7; 10.1038/nrn3475; 10.2471/BLT.11.091850; 10.1007/s00404-019-05258-x; 10.1038/s41372-019-0346-5; 10.1192/bjp.182.1.63; 10.1002/wps.20769; 10.1016/j.ajp.2018.06.020; 10.1002/wps.20780; 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61278-2; 10.1007/s00737-020-01024-0; 10.1192/bjp.150.5.662; 10.1136/jech-2018-211819; 10.1001/jama.296.21.2582; 10.2307/3583145; 10.5455/ijmsph.2014.210820141; 10.1192/bjp.172.6.521; 10.2471/BLT.17.192237; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000013; 10.1001/archpsyc.65.7.805; 10.1111/1471-0528.12567; 10.1016/j.jad.2017.05.003","The authors declare no competing interests.","School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia."

Physiological stress responses that have been linked to both choking and thriving are well-conserved in primates, but it is unknown whether other primates experience similar effects of pressure. Understanding whether this occurs and, if so, its physiological correlates, will help clarify the evolution and proximate causes of choking in humans. To address this, we trained capuchin monkeys on a computer game that had clearly denoted high- and low-pressure trials, then tested them on trials with the same signals of high pressure, but no difference in task difficulty. Monkeys significantly varied in whether they performed worse or better on high-pressure testing trials and performance improved as monkeys gained experience with performing under pressure. Baseline levels of cortisol were significantly negatively related to performance on high-pressure trials as compared to low-pressure trials. Taken together, this indicates that less experience with pressure may interact with long-term stress to produce choking behavior in early sessions of a task. Our results suggest that performance deficits (or improvements) under pressure are not solely due to human specific factors but are rooted in evolutionarily conserved biological factors.",2022,1,19,"Scientific reports","10.1038/s41598-022-04986-6","PMC8770687","Sci Rep","Language Research Center, Georgia State University, Decatur, USA. meg.sosnowski@gmail.com.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Ben&#xed;tez</LastName><ForeName>Marcela E</ForeName><Initials>ME</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Language Research Center, Georgia State University, Decatur, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Anthropology, Emory University, Atlanta, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Brosnan</LastName><ForeName>Sarah F</ForeName><Initials>SF</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, Georgia State University, P.O.

Participants from three age groups (20-25, 40-45, 60-65) retrospectively reported their childhood experiences of domestic adversity on a 17-item scale (e.g., physical abuse, verbal abuse, neglect, poverty). We compared three approaches to operationalising the 17-item scale: a cumulative risk approach, factor analysis, and latent class analysis (LCA). The cumulative risk and dimensional models were represented by a unidimensional and two-dimensional model respectively using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The cumulative risk approach and LCA were viable approaches to operationalising ACE data in PATH. CFA of the dimensional model produced latent factors of threat and deprivation that were highly correlated, potentially leading to problems with multicollinearity when estimating associations. LCA revealed six classes of ACEs: high adversity, low adversity, low affection, authoritarian upbringing, high parental dysfunction, and moderate parental dysfunction. Our study found multiple latent classes within a 17-item questionnaire assessing domestic adversity.

However, it is yet to be understood how the associations between different dimensions of poverty and youth mental health differ across countries. We examine the relationship between multidimensional, as well as income poverty, and depressive symptoms in young people (age 11-25 years) across three middle-income countries. Based on harmonised data from surveys in Colombia, Mexico and South Africa (N=16 173) we constructed a multidimensional poverty index that comprised five <i>deprivations</i> We used Poisson regression to examine relationships between different forms of poverty with depressive symptoms across the countries. Multidimensional poverty was associated with higher rates of depressive symptoms in the harmonised dataset (IRR (incidence rate ratio)=1.25, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.42), in Mexico (IRR=1.34, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.64) and Colombia (IRR=2.01, 95% CI 1.30 to 3.10) but not in South Africa, a finding driven by a lack of associations between child labour and health insurance coverage with depressive symptoms. There was only an association with income poverty and depressive symptoms in South Africa, not in Colombia or Mexico. Depressive symptoms were associated with individual deprivations such as school lag, child labour and lack of access to health services in the harmonised dataset, but not with household deprivations, such as parental unemployment and housing conditions, though the opposite pattern was observed in South Africa.

"35007914","The first day of smoking abstinence is more challenging for women than men: A meta-analysis and meta-regression across 12 low- and middle-income countries.","Jo&#xe3;o M Castaldelli-Maia, Elizabeth D Nesoff, Danielle R Lima, Zila M Sanchez, Silvia S Martins","Maintained abstinence during the first 24&#xa0;h of a quit attempt is a critical predictor of long-term smoking cessation. Little is known about sex differences in the very early abstinence period, particularly in the context of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with varying anti-smoking policies and female smoking prevalences. We examined female sex effects on one-day relapse in a cross-national sample from 12 LMICs. Data from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (2008-2012) included nationally representative samples from 12 LMICs restricted to smokers with&#xa0;&#x2265;&#xa0;1 quit attempt in the past 12&#xa0;months (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;16,576). We ran adjusted logistic regression models for female sex effects on one-day relapse, adjusting for nine individual-level demographics (e.g., age, education, age at smoking initiation) and smoking cessation variables (e.g., exposure to health warnings, receipt of counseling). We then conducted a meta-analysis adjusted for national-level and policy measures through meta-regression (e.g., cigarette consumption per capita, percent of cigarette box covered with warning labels). One-day relapse prevalence varied across countries (2.7-13.6%). The odds of one-day relapse were significantly higher for women than for men in six countries (adjusted for nine individual-level sociodemographic variables), and there were no significant sex differences in the remaining six countries. Result remained significant after meta-regressions for national-level tobacco consumption and policy measures. Sensitivity analyses showed that the odds of one-day relapse for women remained significant when excluding countries with both higher and lower relative rates of female smoking. Larger warning labels on cigarette packs were associated with reduced odds of one-day relapse among women. The first day of a quit attempt is more challenging for women than men in LMICs. Tailored interventions incorporating national policies, in addition to counseling and pharmacotherapy, could play an essential role in supporting women during the initial abstinence phase of smoking cessation in LMICs.",2022,5,1,"Addictive behaviors","10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.107234",NA,"Addict Behav","eng","D000328; D003376; D003906; D005260; D006801; D008297; D011203; D016540; D064424","Adult; Counseling; Developing Countries; Female; Humans; Male; Poverty; Smoking Cessation; Tobacco Use",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, US."
"35003755","The Rohingya refugees: a conceptual framework of their psychosocial adversities, cultural idioms of distress and social suffering.","Nivedita Sudheer, Debanjan Banerjee","Rohingya refugees, a group of religious and ethnic minorities, primarily reside in the South Asian nations. With decades of displacement, forced migration, limited freedom of movement, violence and oppression, they have been termed by the United Nations (UN) as the 'most persecuted minority group' in world history. Literature shows an increased prevalence of psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, insomnia, etc., in this population. However, beyond 'medicalisation', the psychosocial challenges of the Rohingyas need to be understood through the lens of 'social suffering', which results from a complex interplay of multiple social, political, environmental and geographical factors. Lack of essential living amenities, poverty, unemployment, overcrowding, compromised social identity, and persistent traumatic stressors lead to inequality, restricted healthcare access, human rights deprivation and social injustice in this group. Even though the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) has taken a renewed interest in Rohingya re-establishment with well-researched standards of care, there are several pragmatic challenges in their implementation and inclusion in policies. This paper reviews these multi-dimensional psychosocial challenges of the Rohingyas by synthesising various intersecting conceptual models including minority stress, health-stigma-discrimination framework, refugee ecological model and capability approach. Furthermore, it highlights multidisciplinary interventions to mitigate these adversities, improve their living situation and eventually foster healing via means which are culturally relevant and contextually appropriate. These interventions need to involve various stakeholders from a human rights and dignity based lens, including the voices of the Rohingyas and supported by more research in this area.",2021,1,1,"Global mental health (Cambridge, England)","10.1017/gmh.2021.43","PMC8715339","Glob Ment Health (Camb)","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.31899/pgy7.1022; 10.4000/espacepolitique.3290; 10.1007/978-3-030-00512-2_24; 10.3390/ijerph14080942; 10.1007/s40471-017-0096-x",NA,"Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, India."

They are key to understanding the current increases in ""deaths of despair"" among individuals with lower socioeconomic status (SES). The aim of this study was to assess the prospective bidirectional associations between AUD and DD, as well as the effect of SES on these two conditions. The National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions is a cohort study representative of the US adult population, which began in 2001-2002, with follow-up interviews conducted 3 years later. SES was primarily operationalized as educational attainment. AUD, DD, and their levels of severity were defined according to the DSM-5 criteria. The risk of developing an incident DD increased gradually with the recency and the severity of AUD at baseline, but the converse was not observed. Lower SES was an independent risk for incident AUD or DD. SES did not modify the prospective association between AUD and DD. The absence of interaction between SES and moderate or severe AUD for the incident DD must be considered with caution due to the limited number of DD cases reported in these AUD categories. This result is consistent with a causal relationship between AUD and DD, and suggests that therapeutic interventions for AUD may also have beneficial effects to lower DD rates. The independent effects of a lower SES and AUD on DD may result in a vulnerable population cumulating disorders with heavy consequences on health and social well-being.",2022,3,15,"Journal of affective disorders","10.1016/j.jad.2021.12.132","PMC8849577","J Affect Disord","eng","D000328; D019973; D000437; D015331; D003863; D039721; D006801; D012923","Adult; Alcohol-Related Disorders; Alcoholism; Cohort Studies; Depression; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Humans; Social Class","R01 AA028009","NA","Declarations of interest.

Hence, this study's aim is to address this gap to help inform policymakers and the actions of public health leaders in Nigeria. The study included a sample of 336 adult Nigerians who responded to an online Qualtrics survey. Descriptive and linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the predictors of compliance with COVID-19 public health directives and support for government's action against COVID-19 spread. Perceived risk of stigmatization, perceived threat of COVID-19, town/city, gender, and confidence in government's ability to curb the spread and impact of COVID-19 were found to be significantly associated with compliance with COVID-19 public-health directives, and support for governments action against COVID-19.

Since the occurrence of side effects (SEs) appears to be one of the main determinants of early discontinuation of pharmacological treatments contributing to a pseudo-resistance, the purpose of this study was to determine the parameters associated with the occurrence of SEs under ADs in a cohort of patients with TRD. <b>Methods:</b> An observational, cross-sectional, multicentre study was carried out using data from the French network of Expert Centers for TRD. For the 108 patients enrolled in the study, the statistical analyses focused on the overall occurrence and on the profile of the SEs (9 categories, 32 items). <b>Results:</b> SEs were influenced by age and sex and were positively associated with the intensity of anxious, depressive and suicidal symptoms, a history of childhood trauma (sexual abuse, emotional abuse and neglect), and negatively associated with self-esteem, and assessment of overall functioning. <b>Conclusion:</b> Using variables accessible in common practice, these results fall within the dynamic of a more tailored approach to medicine that could allow, through integrated pharmacological management, the continuation of antidepressant treatments, and therefore limit the risk of therapeutic failure.",2021,1,1,"Frontiers in psychiatry","10.3389/fpsyt.2021.795666","PMC8685450","Front Psychiatry","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1176/appi.ajp.160.2.237; 10.4088/JCP.v68n0713; 10.1016/S0193-953X(05)70283-5; 10.1177/070674370705200108; 10.1002/(sici)1520-6394(1997)5:4&lt;154::aid-da2&gt;3.0.co;2-d; 10.1016/S0006-3223(03)00231-2; 10.1017/S0924270800035584; 10.1111/j.1600-0047.2004.00347.x; 10.2165/11316580-000000000-00000; 10.1097/00004714-200010000-00005; 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2013.05.001; 10.1007/s11606-006-5064-y; 10.3389/fgene.2019.01199; 10.1016/j.jad.2014.09.020; 10.1016/j.jad.2015.09.033; 10.1016/j.psychres.2016.04.034; 10.1038/tp.2016.61; 10.1192/bjp.134.4.382; 10.1586/14737175.2015.1070671; 10.2165/00002512-199507030-00004; 10.4103/0973-1229.58818; 10.1016/S0893-133X(97)00194-2; 10.1001/jama.281.6.537; 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016942; 10.1111/j.1442-2042.2009.02316.x; 10.1007/s10508-018-1365-6; 10.1111/j.1399-5618.2009.00699.x; 10.1017/S1352465818000243; 10.1038/mp.2013.54; 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000233; 10.1016/j.encep.2016.05.006; 10.1192/bjp.bp.108.061960; 10.1017/S1461145708009139","AY received speaker's honoraria from AstraZeneca, Janssen, Lundbeck, Otsuka, Servier and carried out clinical studies in relation to the development of medicine Janssen and Lundbeck medicine unrelated to this work.

However, it is unclear whether low SES is associated with a lower diurnal rhythm in autonomic activity markers. We investigated the association between SES and the amplitude of the daily fluctuation of heart rate. We included data of 450 participants of a HELIUS sub-study in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Participants wore an Actiheart monitor (CamNtech), a chest-worn monitor which measures heart rate every 15&#xa0;s for several days. Cosinor analysis was performed on the time series of heart rate within each participant. We analyzed the association between the cosinor parameters (amplitude, midline and peak time of the diurnal HR rhythm) and SES indicators (education, occupational class and a proxy of income) in multivariate linear regression models, adjusting for age, sex and ethnicity. There was a clear diurnal rhythm in the average heart rates, with a peak between noon and 18:00 and a trough between 04:00 and 06:00. This rhythm was present for all categories of education, occupation and income proxy. The estimates for the cosinor parameters did not differ consistently and significantly between categories of education, occupation or income proxy. We did not find any consistent evidence to support our hypothesis of a diminished amplitude in the diurnal variation of heart rate in individuals with lower SES.

The objective of this protocol is to outline a scoping review that maps what is known in the literature about sustainability in NGO surgical work in LMICs. The application of Arksey and O'Malley's six-stage methodological framework is described: identifying research questions; identifying relevant publications; selecting publications; charting the data; reporting results; and stakeholder consultation. The review will include all study designs, as well as editorials, commentaries, sources of unpublished studies and grey literature. Three electronic databases will be searched. Two reviewers will use predefined and iteratively refined selection criteria based on the 'Population-Concept-Context' framework to independently screen titles and abstracts of citations from the search. Disagreements will be resolved together by the reviewers. Full-text screening will also be carried out independently by two reviewers. Disagreements at this stage will be resolved with a third party. The search strategy for grey literature will include searching in ProQuest Dissertations and Theses and the websites listed in a surgical NGO database. Further relevant citations will be identified by screening the reference lists of the included papers.

First: the impact on general population, particularly vulnerable groups such as BAME individuals; Second: the impact on people with pre-existing psychiatric disorders; Third: mental health of COVID patients and those who have recovered and their careers. There are lessons to be learnt from previous pandemics and the impact on mental health. There are high levels of anxiety, depression, substance use (particularly alcohol), posttraumatic stress symptoms, and survivor guilt.

In some areas, up to a third of HIV-positive women experience perinatal depression. Perinatal depression is associated with negative effects on parenting and key domains of child development including cognitive, behavioural and growth, especially in socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Several studies have documented the benefits of psychological interventions for perinatal depression in low- and middle-income countries, but none have evaluated an integrated psychological and parenting intervention for HIV-positive women using task-sharing. This randomised controlled trial aims to evaluate the effect of a home-based intervention, combining a psychological treatment for depression and a parenting programme for perinatally depressed HIV-positive women. This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial, consisting of 48-60 geospatial clusters. A total of 528 pregnant HIV-positive women aged &#x2265; 16&#x2009;years who meet the criteria for depression on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS, score &#x2265; 9)) are recruited from antenatal clinics in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The geospatial clusters are randomised on an allocation ratio of 1:1 to either the intervention or Enhanced Standard of Care (ESoC). The intervention group receives 10 home-based counselling sessions by a lay counsellor (4 antenatal and 6 postnatal sessions) and a booster session at 16&#x2009;months. The intervention combines behavioural activation for depression with a parenting programme, adapted from the UNICEF/WHO Care for Child Development programme. The ESoC group receives two antenatal and two postnatal counselling support and advice telephone calls. In addition, measures have been taken to enhance the routine standard of care. The co-primary outcomes are child cognitive development at 24&#x2009;months assessed on the cognitive subscale of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-Third Edition and maternal depression at 12&#x2009;months measured by the EPDS. The primary analysis will be a modified intention-to-treat analysis. The primary outcomes will be analysed using mixed-effects linear regression.

However, most of the research that led to this conclusion has been conducted with non-representative samples of individuals from higher-income backgrounds, and so further studies including participants from a broader range of socioeconomic backgrounds are required. Here, in a pre-registered study, we analyzed resting-state fMRI from 6839 children ages 9-10 years from the ABCD dataset. For children from households defined as being above poverty (family of 4 with income&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;$25,000, or family of 5+ with income&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;$35,000), we replicated prior findings; that is, we found that better performance on cognitive tests correlated with weaker LFPN-DMN coupling. For children from households defined as being in poverty, the direction of association was reversed, on average: better performance was instead directionally related to stronger LFPN-DMN connectivity, though there was considerable variability. Among children in households below poverty, the direction of this association was predicted in part by features of their environments, such as school type and parent-reported neighborhood safety.

We analysed data from the last three waves of the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS), a nationally representative panel survey that took place every two years from 2008 to 2017. We used an instrumental variable (IV) approach that exploits multiple changes in age eligibility from 1998 to 2012. Depressive symptoms were assessed using an 8-item version of the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; participants who scored above 8 were considered at risk for depression. Life satisfaction was rated on a scale of 1 ('very dissatisfied') to 10 ('very satisfied'); participants who scored 8 or above were classified as satisfied. We also examined impacts on educational deficit (&#x2265;2 years behind) and not being in education, employment or training (NEET) as secondary outcomes, as these are also important for mental health. Age eligibility strongly predicted CSG receipt at Wave 3.

Community-centred mental health and psychosocial support (cc-MHPSS) programmes may provide insights to address the psychosocial well-being of conflict-affected individuals, though literature is mixed on community impact. This review aimed to synthesise qualitative evidence to understand the kind of experiences conflict-affected participants have and how these experiences occur during cc-MHPSS programme engagement in SSA. We searched Global Health, MEDLINE, Psychological Information Database, Embase Classic+Embase, Social Policy and Practice, Web of Science, Africa-Wide Information, PubMed and Global Index Medicus databases. Eligible publications qualitatively reported on conflict-affected participants' experiences of engagement in cc-MHPSS programmes. Data were extracted to summarise publication characteristics. The results were synthesised using a thematic synthesis analysis. The search yielded 953 records, of which 20 publications were included in the review. Included publications were located in Rwanda (n=8), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (n=3), Mozambique (n=3), Sierra Leone (n=1), Ghana (n=1), Uganda (n=1), Zimbabwe (n=1) and South Sudan (n=1); one publication included three countries (Sierra Leone, Liberia and Uganda). Findings include the themes of (1) the experience of change in time and space, and (2) the sharing and silence of participants' experiences. Findings demonstrate that elements transferred by participants from a cc-MHPSS programme to a natural community, and vice versa, contribute to participants' healing. Elements' transfer, or non-transfer, was often related to participants' disclosure, or non-disclosure, of experiences. Findings suggest that there are elements from a cc-MHPSS programme and a wider community which aid participant engagement and work therapeutically. More rigorous research is needed concerning how participants experience change during cc-MHPSS programme engagement in proximity to their relationship with the wider community.

It has been reported that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and low socioeconomic status (SES) might be associated with allostatic load (AL) in adulthood. In turn, elevated AL index has been found to predict a number of unfavorable health outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to perform a systematic review of studies investigating the association of ACEs and childhood SES with AL in adult populations. Independent online searches covered the publication period up to 20th Jun 2021. A total of 27 studies were included in qualitative synthesis. The majority of eligible studies showed that ACEs (14 out of 19 studies recording ACEs, 73.7%) and low childhood SES (11 out of 12 studies recording childhood SES, 91.7%) are associated with elevated AL in adults. However, several processes were found to mediate or moderate this association. These include educational attainments, social support, health behaviors, adult stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, coping strategies and aging. Moreover, a substantial methodological heterogeneity of approaches to calculating the AL index was observed. Apart from reports from overlapping samples, none of eligible studies used the same set of biomarkers. Findings from this systematic review imply that early-life psychosocial stress might have a lasting impact on biological dysregulations captured by the AL index.

We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in UK Biobank (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;394,718) to (i) capture variants for lifetime smoking, (ii) variants for EA, and (iii) variants that contribute to lifetime smoking independently from EA ('smoking-without-EA'). Based on the GWASs, three polygenic scores (PGSs) were created for individuals from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR, N&#x2009;=&#x2009;17,805) and the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 (NEMESIS-2, N&#x2009;=&#x2009;3090). We tested gene-environment (G&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;E) interactions between each PGS, neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and EA on lifetime smoking. To assess if the PGS effects were specific to smoking or had broader implications, we repeated the analyses with measures of mental health. After subtracting EA effects from the smoking GWAS, the SNP-based heritability decreased from 9.2 to 7.2%. The genetic correlation between smoking and SES characteristics was reduced, whereas overlap with smoking traits was less affected by subtracting EA. The PGSs for smoking, EA, and smoking-without-EA all predicted smoking. For mental health, only the PGS for EA was a reliable predictor. There were suggestions for G&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;E for some relationships, but there were no clear patterns per PGS type. This study showed that the genetic architecture of smoking has an EA component in addition to other, possibly more direct components.

Driven in part by family stressors and insufficient sleep, mental health disproportionately affects low SES urban adolescents. In the United States, American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth exhibit excessively high rates of mental health problems. Family functioning is strongly associated with adolescent mental health, and sleep problems may serve as a pathway between family functioning and mental health. Using mixed methods we examine the associations among family functioning, subjective- and actigraphy-measured sleep, mental health (depressive and anxiety symptoms), and cultural identity in a sample of urban AI/AN youth. All participants (N&#xa0;= 142) completed surveys; a random subsample (n&#xa0;= 26) completed qualitative interviews to assess family and cultural dynamics related to sleep, which informed hypothesized direct and indirect effects that were tested using survey data. Narratives identified mechanisms of family cohesion (e.g., daily interactions that build perceived family togetherness and family-centered traditional activities) and the role that family cohesion plays in sleep (e.g., ensuring stability of sleep environments). Path analysis showed direct effects of improved family functioning on fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms, and indirect effects through lower self-reported sleep disturbance (but not through greater actigraphy-measured sleep duration or efficiency). Cultural identity did not moderate effects in quantitative tests. Our findings illustrate the complex associations among family functioning, sleep, and mental health in AI/AN youth. Family-based interventions to improve adolescent mental health should address modifiable intervention targets such as sleep, and address sources of both risk and resilience relevant to urban AI/AN families, including extended family and cultural practices.",2022,1,1,"Social science &amp; medicine (1982)","10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114582","PMC8748395","Soc Sci Med","eng","D000293; D000072957; D005192; D006801; D007198; D008603; D012890; D014481; D044467","Adolescent; Alaskan Natives; Family Health; Humans; Indians, North American; Mental Health; Sleep; United States; American Indian or Alaska Native","R01 MD012190","NA",NA,"RAND Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."

Despite its importance and prevalence, it is not clear whether diminished growth relates to brain development and general cognitive ability. Further, diminished growth is more common in areas of extreme poverty, raising the possibility that it may mediate previously shown links between socioeconomic status (SES) and brain structure. To address these gaps, 79 children growing up in an extremely poor, urban area of Bangladesh underwent MRI at age six years. Structural brain images were submitted to Mindboggle software, a Docker-compliant and high-reproducibility tool for tissue segmentation and regional estimations of volume, surface area, cortical thickness, sulcal depth, and mean curvature. Diminished growth predicted brain morphometry and mediated the link between SES and brain morphometry most consistently for subcortical and white matter subcortical volumes. Meanwhile, brain volume in left pallidum and right ventral diencephalon mediated the relationship between diminished growth and full-scale IQ.

The current study examines the relation between experiences of racial discrimination and trajectories of depression symptoms over the course of pregnancy. Participants completed standardized measures regarding symptoms of depression at four timepoints during pregnancy and reported on experiences of racial discrimination at one timepoint. Latent growth curve modeling was used to examine the relation between discrimination and initial levels (intercept) and trajectories (slope) of depression symptoms over pregnancy. Participants were 129 pregnant individuals recruited from obstetric clinics and oversampled for elevated depression symptoms. Thirty-six percent of the participants were living at or below 200% of the federal poverty line. Fifty-four percent of the sample identified as non-Latinx White, 26% as Latinx, and 13% as non-Latinx Black. An unconditional latent growth curve modeling revealed a negative quadratic trajectory of depression symptoms during pregnancy. When women's report of discrimination was added as a predictor of depression trajectories, discrimination predicted the initial value (intercept) of depression symptoms, but not change over the course of pregnancy (slope). Specifically, higher levels of experiences of discrimination were associated with higher levels of depression symptoms. When sociodemographic and contextual covariates were included in the model, a low family income-to-needs ratio was also related to higher levels of depression symptoms.

We examined whether exposure to Brazil's conditional cash transfers programme (CCT), <i>Bolsa Fam&#xed;lia</i> (BFP), during childhood reduces the risk of mental health problems in early adolescence. We used data from 2063 participants in the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort study. Propensity score matching (PSM) estimated the association between BFP participation at age 6 and externalising problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire - SDQ and violent behaviour) and socio-emotional competencies (Development and Well-Being Assessment questionnaire, and the Nowick-Strickland Internal-External Scale) at age 11. PSM results suggest that programme participation at age of six was not significantly associated with externalising problems (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.433), prosocial behaviour (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.654), violent behaviour (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.342), social aptitudes (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.281), positive attributes (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.439), or locus of control (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.148) at the age of 11 years. Participation in BFP during childhood was not associated with improved or worsened mental health in early adolescence.

Impairments in food-related inhibitory control contribute to BED/BN and could be targeted by food-specific inhibitory control training (ICT). The aim of this study was to establish the feasibility and acceptability of augmenting treatment for individuals with BN/BED with an ICT app (FoodT), which targets motor inhibition to food stimuli using a go/no-go paradigm. Eighty patients with BED/BN receiving psychological and/or pharmacological treatment were randomly allocated to a treatment-as-usual group (TAU; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;40) or TAU augmented with the 5-min FoodT app daily (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;40) for 4 weeks. This mixed-methods study assessed feasibility outcomes, effect sizes of clinical change, and acceptability using self-report measures. Pre-registered cut-offs for recruitment, retention, and adherence were met, with 100% of the targeted sample size (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;80) recruited within 12 months, 85% of participants retained at 4 weeks, and 80% of the FoodT&#xa0;+&#xa0;TAU group completing &#x2264;8 sessions. The reduction in binge eating did not differ between groups. However, moderate reductions in secondary outcomes (eating disorder psychopathology: SES&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.57, 95% CI [-1.12, -0.03]; valuation of high energy-dense foods: SES&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.61, 95% CI [-0.87, -0.05]) were found in the FoodT group compared to TAU. Furthermore, small greater reductions in food addiction (SES&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.46, 95% CI [-1.14, 0.22]) and lack of premeditation (SES&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.42, 95% CI [-0.77, -0.07]) were found in the FoodT group when compared to TAU. The focus groups revealed acceptability of FoodT. Participants discussed personal barriers (e.g. distractions) and suggested changes to the app (e.g. adding a meditation exercise). Augmenting treatment for BED/BN with a food-specific ICT app is feasible, acceptable, and may reduce clinical symptomatology with high reach and wide dissemination.",2022,1,1,"Appetite","10.1016/j.appet.2021.105788",NA,"Appetite","eng","D056912; D052018; D005240; D001068; D006801; D063731","Binge-Eating Disorder; Bulimia Nervosa; Feasibility Studies; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Humans; Mobile Applications",NA,"NA",NA,"School of Psychology, University of Exeter, Exeter, Devon, UK."

We investigated a novel hypothesis that differences in early-developing sensory networks-specifically the ventral visual stream (VVS), which is involved in processing visual stimuli-contribute to SES-related disparities in executive functions (EF) and academic outcomes. We used fMRI to investigate SES-related differences in neural function in children (6-8 years, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;62) during two attentional tasks involving attention to visual information: cued attention and memory-guided attention. Recruitment of VVS during both tasks was associated with EF and academic achievement, and SES-related differences in VVS activation during cued attention were marginally explained by differences in cognitive stimulation. VVS activation during cued attention mediated SES-related differences in academic achievement. Finally, the link between VVS activation during both tasks and academic achievement was mediated by differences in EF. We extend previous work by highlighting that: (i) early-developing visual processing regions play a role in supporting complex attentional processes, (ii) childhood SES is associated with VVS function, which is explained in part by SES-related differences in cognitive stimulation and (iii) provide preliminary evidence that individual differences in VVS function may play a role in the emergence of the income-achievement gap.",2021,12,1,"Developmental cognitive neuroscience","10.1016/j.dcn.2021.101025","PMC8551593","Dev Cogn Neurosci","eng","D000076363; D000124; D002648; D003071; D056344; D006801; D012923","Academic Success; Achievement; Child; Cognition; Executive Function; Humans; Social Class","R01 MH103291; R37 MH119194; K99 HD099203; R01 MH106482; F32 HD089514; R56 MH119194","10.1038/nrn4025; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01019.x; 10.1111/1467-8624.t01-1-00382; 10.1111/desc.12900; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00675.x; 10.3389/fnhum.2010.00021; 10.1038/ncomms13995; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00875.x; 10.1093/cercor/bhp215; 10.1073/pnas.1602413113; 10.1016/j.neuron.2017.08.034; 10.1111/desc.12450; 10.1016/j.tics.2011.11.014; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.12.109; 10.1080/03637750903310360; 10.1038/ncomms9165; 10.1111/desc.12529; 10.1016/j.dcn.2019.100641; 10.1111/desc.12080; 10.1177/0956797615572233; 10.1146/annurev.psych.58.110405.085542.Mediation; 10.1023/A:1026595011371; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1808-18.2018; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.2277; 10.1117/12.572040; 10.1038/nn.3983; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00600.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2005.00394.x; 10.1111/cdev.13149; 10.1037/fam0000838; 10.1017/S0048577200981368; 10.1371/journal.pone.0162511; 10.1177/1087054713507974; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.01.021; 10.1177/0956797617742725; 10.1016/j.dcn.2019.100699; 10.1111/cdev.13315; 10.1016/j.dcn.2019.100731; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.02.043; 10.1162/jocn_a_01202; 10.1093/cercor/bhx172; 10.1093/cercor/bhv028; 10.1111/j.1750-8606.2007.00002.x; 10.1017/S0305000907008343; 10.1080/00220671.2014.979913; 10.1177/0734282915569447; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00236.x; 10.1371/journal.pone.0035744; 10.1037/1082-989X.7.4.422; 10.1177/1745691617708630; 10.1016/j.neuron.2006.01.021; 10.1093/cercor/bhz066; 10.1016/0959-4388(94)90066-3; 10.1111/psyp.12547; 10.1016/j.dcn.2018.08.002; 10.1016/j.dcn.2010.11.001; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.02.042; 10.1038/nprot.2006.46; 10.1086/651257","The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.","Harvard University, Department of Psychology, Cambridge, MA, USA."

This study investigated perceptions of, and motivations for, alcohol consumption during pregnancy and associated practices in a rural district of Lesotho. A combination of purposive and snowball sampling methods were used to identify pregnant women and mothers with young children from the general community, as well as from alcohol-serving venues. Between September 2016 and March 2017, a trained data collector conducted in-depth interviews with 40 women on reasons why pregnant women drink, what they know about the risk of drinking alcohol during pregnancy, and perceptions of women who drink during pregnancy. Sixty-five percent of women (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;26) reported that they consumed alcohol during pregnancy. Findings were clustered into four themes: 1) alcohol use in daily and cultural life; 2) alcohol as relief from stress and hunger; 3) alcohol's effect on the baby; and 4) access to information about alcohol consumption. Our data suggest that alcohol use was a prominent feature of daily life and a key part of traditional events and ceremonies. Other than potentially harming the baby through falling on their stomachs while inebriated, women did not mention other risks associated with prenatal alcohol use. Rather, there were prominent beliefs that drinking alcohol - home-brewed alcohol in particular - had cleansing or protective benefits for the baby. Experiences of food insecurity were prominent, and women reported that alcohol helped curb their hunger and allowed them to save food to give to their children. Within this context of chronic poverty and food insecurity, alcohol use during pregnancy will continue to represent a valid, though tragic choice if the structural conditions and current social arrangements that facilitate prenatal alcohol use remain unchanged.",2021,12,1,"Social science &amp; medicine (1982)","10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114482",NA,"Soc Sci Med","eng","D000428; D002648; D002675; D005260; D007722; D006801; D007927; D011247; D037841; D036301","Alcohol Drinking; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Lesotho; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Qualitative Research","R24 AA022919","NA",NA,"Institute for Life Course Health Research, Department of Global Health, Stellenbosch University, Office 4009, 4th Floor, Education Building, Francie van Zijl Drive, Tygerberg, 7505, South Africa; School of Nursing and Midwifery, Queens University, Belfast, Medical Biology Centre, 97 Lisburn Road, Belfast, Northern Ireland, BT9 7BL, United Kingdom."

Children in poverty experience have a high risk for developmental delays. Poverty engenders disproportionate exposure to psychological adversity which may contribute to impaired offspring development; however the effect may be mitigated by social support and other aspects of resilience. Our objective was to determine the association between maternal stress, adversity and social support and early infant neurobehavior and child behavior at two and three years. We conducted a longitudinal mother-infant cohort study nested within a regional home visiting program in Cincinnati, Ohio. Four home study visits were completed to collect measures of maternal stress, adversity and social support and infant and child behavior. A measure of infant neurobehavior ('high-arousal' infant) was derived from the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) at 1&#xa0;month and externalizing and internalizing symptoms were measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at 24 and 36&#xa0;months. Linear and logistic regression identified associations between maternal risk/protective factors and infant and child behavioral measures. We used stratification and multiplicative interaction terms to examine potential interactions. We enrolled n&#x2009;=&#x2009;55 pregnant mothers and follow 53 mother-offspring dyads at 1&#xa0;month, 40 dyads at 24&#xa0;months and 27 dyads at 36&#xa0;months. Maternal adversity and protective factors were not associated with neurobehavior at one month. However, maternal depression and measures of distress in pregnancy were significantly associated with internalizing and externalizing symptoms at 24 and 36&#xa0;months. This pilot study established the feasibility of conducting longitudinal research within a community intervention program. In addition, although there were no statistically significant associations between maternal psychosocial factors in pregnancy and infant neurobehavior, there were several associations at 24&#xa0;months, primarily internalizing symptoms, which persisted through 36&#xa0;months.

"34647776","Measurement invariance of the Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire across college status, race, and childhood SES in a diverse community sample.","Kevin W Campbell, Kinsey Pebley, James MacKillop, James G Murphy","The Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire (YAACQ) was designed to measure the various domains of alcohol-related problems experienced by emerging adults (EAs), but has primarily been used in college samples and it remains unclear whether the psychometric properties of the YAACQ function similarly in racially and economically diverse populations. The present study assessed the factor structure and evaluated measurement invariance, latent mean differences, and correlates of the 48-item eight-factor YAACQ across college status, race, and childhood socioeconomic status (SES). EAs ages 21.5-25 (<i>N</i> = 602; 57.3% female, 47.0% White, 41.5 % Black, 35.4% noncollege EAs) who consumed 3/4 + alcoholic beverages (for women/men) at least twice in the previous month completed measures of alcohol use, alcohol-related consequences and demographics. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the 48-item eight-factor structure across the entire sample. However, one item related to academic achievement was predictably endorsed by few noncollege EAs and thus, was dropped. Multiple-group CFA demonstrated measurement invariance of a revised 47-item eight-factor YAACQ across college status, race, and childhood SES. Assessment of latent mean differences revealed that noncollege EAs reported more alcohol-related consequences overall, compared to college students, including greater endorsement of severe problem domains. White EAs reported more total alcohol-related consequences relative to Black EAs, and EAs of low childhood SES reported more total alcohol-related consequences compared to those of high childhood SES. Furthermore, all eight alcohol consequence factors demonstrated concurrent associations with weekly alcohol use, binge drinking, and high intensity drinking within each subgroup. Findings suggest that the YAACQ is a psychometrically robust measure of alcohol-related consequences across demographic groups.

The aim of this study was to investigate the intergenerational and multidimensional impacts of SMD in rural Ethiopia. This comparative study was nested within an existing population-based cohort study. We collected data from a total 5762 family members of 532 households (266 households with at least one family member with SMD and 266 sex and age matched mentally well controls from the neighborhood) in 2019. The main outcomes were multidimensional poverty, mortality, food insecurity, and family satisfaction. Multidimensional poverty Index was higher in the households of persons with SMD (74&#xb7;44%) than the comparison households (38&#xb7;35%). School attendance was lower in children of people with SMD (63&#xb7;28%) than children of the comparisons (78&#xb7;08%). The median years of schooling was also lower among children of people with SMD than the controls. This lower attendance was also true among siblings of people with SMD (35&#xb7;52%) than the comparisons (49&#xb7;33%). Over the course of 20 years, family members who have a person with SMD in their household had 23% increased risk of death compared to family members who did not have a person with SMD in their household. Severe food insecurity was also higher in the SMD households (20&#xb7;68%) than the comparison (13&#xb7;53%) while family satisfaction was lower. Families of people with SMD experience pervasive multidimensional and intergenerational impacts.

Adults who have been exposed to such adversities exhibit premature and more severe age-related declines in brain health. Unfortunately, it remains unclear whether the negative effects of early life adversity (ELA) on brain health can be remediated through intervention in adulthood. Physical activity may represent a low-cost behavioral approach to address the long-term consequences of ELA on brain health. However, there has been limited research examining the impact of physical activity on brain health among adults with a history of ELA. Accordingly, the purpose of this review is to (1) review the influence of ELA on brain health in adulthood and (2) highlight evidence for the role of neurotrophic factors, hypothalamic-adrenal-pituitary axis regulation, inflammatory processes, and epigenetic modifications in mediating the effects of both ELA and physical activity on brain health outcomes in adulthood.

This study hence investigates the unexplored association between obesity and multimorbidity among older adults from LMICs. Cross-sectional, community-based data from the WHO Study on global Ageing and adult health (SAGE) were analysed. The sample consisted of 20,198 individuals aged &#x2265;60&#xa0;years [Mean age (SD)&#xa0;=&#xa0;69.3 (13.1) years; 54.1% female] from China, India, Ghana, Mexico, Russia, South Africa.

After adjusting for potential confounders, overall, BMI&#xa0;&#x2265;&#xa0;30&#xa0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> was associated with 1.43 (95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.21-1.69) times higher odds for multimorbidity, while this estimate for high WC was 1.50 (95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.21-1.86). Significant associations emerged between obesity measures and five out of twelve chronic conditions. Results from this study underline the need to reduce obesity among older adults in areas where its prevalence is increasing, as it is associated with increased odds for multimorbidity.

"34592751","Default and executive networks' roles in diverse adolescents' emotionally engaged construals of complex social issues.","Rebecca Gotlieb, Xiao-Fei Yang, Mary Helen Immordino-Yang","Across adolescence, individuals enrich their concrete, empathic, context-specific interpretations of social-world happenings with abstract, situation-transcending, system-level considerations-invoking values, bigger implications and broader emotional perspectives. To investigate neural mechanisms involved in abstract construals vs concrete construals and the effects of emotional engagement on these mechanisms, 65 mid-adolescents aged 14-18 years reacted to compelling video mini-documentaries during private, open-ended interviews and again during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Following calls to diversify samples, participants were ethnically diverse low-socioeconomic status (SES) urban adolescents performing well in school. Participants spontaneously produced both concrete and abstract construals in the interview, and tendencies to produce each varied independently. As hypothesized, participants who made more abstract construals showed a greater subsequent default mode network (DMN) activity; those who made more concrete construals showed greater executive control network (ECN) activity. Findings were independent of IQ, SES, age and gender. Within individuals, DMN activation, especially when individuals were reporting strong emotional engagement, and ECN deactivation together predicted an abstract construal to a trial. Additionally, brief ECN activation early in the trial strengthened the DMN-abstraction relationship. Findings suggest a neural mechanism for abstract social thought in adolescence. They also link adolescents' natural construals of social situations to distinct networks' activity and suggest separable sociocognitive traits that may vary across youths.",2022,4,1,"Social cognitive and affective neuroscience","10.1093/scan/nsab108","PMC8972204","Soc Cogn Affect Neurosci","eng","D000293; D001921; D001931; D056344; D006801; D008279; D009434","Adolescent; Brain; Brain Mapping; Executive Function; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Pathways",NA,"10.31234/osf.io/6nk4x; 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000381",NA,"Center for Affective Neuroscience, Development, Learning and Education, Brain and Creativity Institute, Rossier School of Education, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089-2921, USA."
"34591364","Analysis of the SPARK study COVID-19 parent survey: Early impact of the pandemic on access to services, child/parent mental health, and benefits of online services.","Anjana Bhat","Children with ASD receive a multitude of educational, medical, and therapeutic services. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, all of these services came to a complete halt following strict lockdowns. Many services have resumed in a hybrid format using face to face and virtual modes of delivery. This study describes findings from the COVID-19 impact survey administered at the onset of the pandemic in a subgroup of families from the SPARK cohort (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;6393), one of the largest ASD cohorts in the US. The differential early impact of COVID-19 on various subgroups of children with ASD and their families was examined. Caregivers of children and adolescents with ASD between 19&#x2009;months and 18&#x2009;years completed an online survey inquiring about the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on access to services, parent concerns about the same, impact on child's ASD-related behaviors, child, and parent mental health, and the benefits/potential benefits of online/future online services. Analysis revealed that certain demographic (age, income/SES) and child-related factors (repetitive behaviors, language, functional, cognitive, and motor impairments, and child's understanding), as well as parent's past mental health were associated with/predicted greater service disruptions, greater ASD-related behaviors, and greater negative impact on parent mental health. In conclusion, younger children, children from low-income families, and children with greater impairment severity (more severe repetitive behaviors, language, cognitive, function, language, and motor impairments) were more negatively impacted by the pandemic through service disruptions, increased ASD-related behaviors, parent health/family impact, and found online interactions to be less beneficial. LAY SUMMARY: The SPARK study impact survey shows that at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, parents reported significant service disruptions, negative impact on their child's ASD-related behaviors as well as their own mental health; which was greater in families with younger children, children with greater ASD severity, and children from low-income families. Majority of families did not report significant benefits of online services whereas some families did. Low-income families were hopeful about receiving benefits through future online services. Overall, these findings have important implications for future clinical care delivery and healthcare policies to ensure that healthcare services are not interrupted during a potential resurgence of COVID-19 or other pandemics. A combination of in-person and online healthcare and family support services must be implemented to prevent negative health impacts in the future.",2021,11,1,"Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research","10.1002/aur.2618","PMC8578426","Autism Res","eng","D000293; D000067877; D000086382; D003140; D006801; D008603; D058873; D010290; D000086402","Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Parents; SARS-CoV-2","R41MC42492; P20-GM103446; R01MH125823; P20 GM103446; R01 MH125823","10.1352/0895-8017(2004)109&lt;237:PWACIM&gt;2.0.CO;2; 10.1007/s10803-020-04670-6; 10.1186/s13229-020-00365-y; 10.1037/a0021900; 10.1002/aur.2480; 10.3233/prm-200740; 10.1192/bjp.175.5.444; 10.1177/1362361316672179; 10.1093/ptj/pzab116; 10.1093/ptj/pzz190; 10.1002/aur.2453; 10.2522/ptj.20100294; 10.1001/archpediatrics.2008.506; 10.1177/1362361304047224; 10.1016/j.rasd.2009.12.009; 10.1111/j.1468-3148.2012.00692.x; 10.1007/s10803-010-1148-y; 10.1080/03004430701491721; 10.3390/ijerph17249519; 10.1007/s10995-011-0833-6; 10.3390/brainsci10060341; 10.1007/s10803-011-1236-7; 10.1007/s40617-020-00438-7; 10.1016/j.ridd.2020.103790; 10.1001/jama.2020.14745; 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2006.00825.x; 10.1023/A:1015223615529; 10.1177/1362361309105658; 10.1007/s10995-013-1292-z; 10.1093/jpepsy/jsh039; 10.1016/j.neuron.2018.01.015; 10.1007/s10803-018-3724-5; 10.1037/tra0000672; 10.1177/1362361316687989; 10.1016/j.ridd.2004.12.002; 10.1001/archpedi.160.8.825; 10.1016/j.rasd.2010.04.017; 10.1111/jir.12776; 10.1002/aur.2589; 10.1007/s10803-018-3862-9; 10.1007/s40489-016-0086-9; 10.1542/peds.2008-1057; 10.1352/0047-6765(2003)41&lt;329:atsmcf&gt;2.0.co;2; 10.1007/s10803-006-0213-z; 10.1002/ajmg.b.31103; 10.1097/dbp.0b013e318165c7a0; 10.1007/s10803-020-04760-5; 10.1007/s40474-017-0122-1; 10.1002/aur.2070; 10.1111/jir.12769; 10.3390/children7090128; 10.1111/j.1365-2214.2009.01030.x; 10.3390/brainsci10110892; 10.1016/j.ridd.2011.10.008; 10.1017/s001216220600140x; 10.1177/2396941517745674; 10.1007/s40474-020-00214-w; 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01713; 10.1002/aur.2514; 10.3389/fpsyt.2021.700247; 10.1177/13623613211004795; 10.1111/1460-6984.12440; 10.1097/phm.0000000000001571; 10.1007/s10803-006-0323-7; 10.1016/j.ijporl.2020.110262; 10.1007/s10864-018-9292-0; 10.1111/j.1745-7599.2007.00222.x; 10.1007/s10803-017-3227-9; 10.1016/j.rasd.2015.11.008; 10.1007/s10803-020-04816-6; 10.1007/s10803-006-0281-0; 10.1542/peds.2014-3667c","There are no conflicts of interest to report.","Department of Physical Therapy, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA."

To compare a new, registration-based (Reg) method with two existing methods (active surface [AS] and propagation segmentation [PropSeg]) to measure cord atrophy changes over time in MS. Retrospective. Cohort I: Eight healthy controls (HC) and 28 MS patients enrolled at a single institution, and cohort II: 25 HC and 63 MS patients enrolled at three European sites. 3D T1-weighted gradient echo sequence, acquired at 1.5&#x2009;T (cohort I) and 3.0&#x2009;T (cohort II). Percentage cord area changes (PCACs) between baseline and follow-up (cohort I: 2.34&#x2009;years [interquartile range&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.00-2.55&#x2009;years], cohort II: 1.05&#x2009;years [interquartile range&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.01-1.18&#x2009;years]) were evaluated for all subjects using Reg, AS, and PropSeg. Reg included an accurate registration of baseline and follow-up straightened cord images, followed by AS-based optimized cord segmentation. A subset of studies was analyzed twice by two observers. Linear regression models were used to estimate annualized PCAC, and effect sizes expressed as the ratio between the estimated differences and HC error term (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Reproducibility was assessed by linear mixed-effect models. Annualized PCACs were used for sample size calculations (significance: &#x3b1;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.05, power: 1&#x2009;-&#x2009;&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.80). Annualized PCACs and related standard errors (SEs) were lower with Reg than with other methods: PCAC in MS patients at 1.5&#x2009;T was -1.12% (SE&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.22) with Reg, -1.32% (SE&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.30) with AS, and -1.40% (SE&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.33) with PropSeg, while at 3.0&#x2009;T PCAC was -0.83% (SE&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.25) with Reg, -0.92% (SE&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.32) with AS, and -1.18 (SE&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.53) with PropSeg. This was reflected in larger effect sizes and lower sample sizes. Intra- and inter-observer agreement range was 0.72-0.91 with AS, and it was &gt;0.96 with Reg. The results support the use of the registration method to measure cervical cord atrophy progression in future MS clinical studies. 3 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 2.",2022,5,1,"Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI","10.1002/jmri.27937",NA,"J Magn Reson Imaging","eng","D001284; D006801; D008279; D009103; D015203; D012189; D013116","Atrophy; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multiple Sclerosis; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Spinal Cord",NA,"NA",NA,"Neuroimaging Research Unit, Division of Neuroscience, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy."

The aim of this study was to understand neurosurgeons' experiences of, aspirations for, and ability to conduct and disseminate clinical research in LMICs. This was a two-stage inductive qualitative study situated within the naturalistic paradigm. This study committed to an interpretivist way of knowing (epistemology), and considered reality subjective and multiple (ontology). Data collection used online methods and included a web-based survey tool for demographic data, an asynchronous online focus group and follow-up semistructured interviews. Data were analysed using Braun and Clarke's Reflexive Thematic Analysis supported by NVivo V.12. LMICs. In April-July 2020, 26 neurosurgeons from 11 LMICs participated in this study (n=24 in the focus groups, n=20 in follow-up interviews). The analysis gave rise to five themes: The local landscape; creating capacity; reach and impact; collaborative inquiry; growth and sustainability. Each theme contained an inhibitor and stimulus to neurosurgeons conducting and disseminating clinical research, interpreted as 'the neurosurgical research potential in LMICs'. Mentorship, education, infrastructure, impact and engagement were identified as specific accelerators. Whereas lack of generalisability, absence of dissemination and dissemination without peer review may desensitise the impact of research conducted by neurosurgeons. The geographical, political and population complexities make research endeavour challenging for neurosurgeons in LMICs. Yet in spite of, and because of, these complexities LMICs provide rich opportunities to advance global neurosurgery.

However, the relation between home numeracy practices and children's numerical skills is complex and might depend upon both the type and difficulty of activities, as well as the type of math skills. Studies have also argued that this relation may be driven by factors that are not systematically controlled for in the literature, including socio-economic status (SES), parental math skills and children's IQ. Finally, as most prior studies have focused on preschoolers, it remains unclear to what extent there remains a relation between the home numeracy environment and math skills when children are in elementary school. In the present study, we tested an extensive range of math skills in 66 8-year-olds, including non-symbolic quantity processing, symbolic number understanding, transcoding, counting, and mental arithmetic. We also asked parents to complete a questionnaire about their SES, academic expectations, academic attitudes, and the numeracy practices that they provide at home. Finally, we measured their arithmetic fluency as a proxy for parental math skills. Over and above differences in socio-economic status, parental arithmetic fluency, child's IQ, and time spent with the child, we found a positive relation between the frequency of formal numeracy practices that were at or above grade level and two separate measures of mental arithmetic. We further found that the frequency of these advanced formal numeracy practices was related to parents' academic expectations. Therefore, our study shows that home numeracy experiences predict arithmetic skills in elementary school children, but only when those activities are formal and sufficiently challenging for children.",2021,1,1,"PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0255400","PMC8452026","PLoS One","eng","D001290; D002648; D005260; D006801; D007858; D008297; D008433; D010287; D010290; D011795","Attitude; Child; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Mathematics; Parent-Child Relations; Parents; Surveys and Questionnaires",NA,"10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00713.x; 10.1037/0012-1649.42.1.59; 10.1126/science.1158808; 10.1007/s11881-016-0134-2; 10.1002/cd.14; 10.1177/0956797617742725; 10.1007/978-981-10-2553-2_7; 10.1016/j.jecp.2013.11.006; 10.1002/icd.2013; 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02074; 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01925; 10.1016/j.jecp.2017.10.002; 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.547626; 10.1111/1467-8624.00417; 10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00340; 10.1016/j.jecp.2020.104992; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1994.tb00747.x; 10.1016/j.jecp.2009.03.009; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01508.x; 10.1016/j.jecp.2011.07.004; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01746.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00897.x; 10.1371/journal.pone.0168227; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1983.tb03884.x; 10.1111/desc.12436; 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01597; 10.3758/bf03193146; 10.1016/j.nicl.2018.10.020; 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.610870; 10.1111/cdev.12676; 10.1126/science.aac7427; 10.1177/0956797615592630; 10.1016/j.jecp.2017.01.011; 10.1037/a0019671","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Lyon Neuroscience Research Center (CRNL), Experiential Neuroscience and Mental Training Team, INSERM U1028-CNRS UMR5292, University of Lyon, Lyon, France."

However, it remains unclear whether the presence of FTD characterises a specific subgroup of patients showing more prominent illness severity, neurocognitive and functional impairments. This study aimed to identify stable and generalizable FTD-subgroups of patients with recent-onset psychosis (ROP) by applying a comprehensive data-driven clustering approach and to test the validity of these subgroups by assessing associations between this FTD-related stratification, social and occupational functioning, and neurocognition. 279 patients with ROP were recruited as part of the multi-site European PRONIA study (Personalised Prognostic Tools for Early Psychosis Management; www.pronia.eu). Five FTD-related symptoms (conceptual disorganization, poverty of content of speech, difficulty in abstract thinking, increased latency of response and poverty of speech) were assessed with Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). The results with two patient subgroups showing different levels of FTD were the most stable and generalizable clustering solution (predicted clustering strength value&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.86). FTD-High subgroup had lower scores in social (p<sub>fdr</sub> &lt; 0.001) and role (p<sub>fdr</sub>&#xa0;&lt; 0.001) functioning, as well as worse neurocognitive performance in semantic (p<sub>fdr</sub> &lt; 0.001) and phonological verbal fluency (p<sub>fdr</sub>&#xa0;&lt; 0.001), short-term verbal memory (p<sub>fdr</sub>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002) and abstract thinking (p<sub>fdr</sub>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.010), in comparison to FTD-Low group.

"34520466","Intrinsic capacity and its associations with incident dependence and mortality in 10/66 Dementia Research Group studies in Latin America, India, and China: A population-based cohort study.","Martin J Prince, Daisy Acosta, Mariella Guerra, Yueqin Huang, K S Jacob, Ivonne Z Jimenez-Velazquez, A T Jotheeswaran, Juan J Llibre Rodriguez, Aquiles Salas,  ..., Adolfo Valhuerdi","The World Health Organization (WHO) has reframed health and healthcare for older people around achieving the goal of healthy ageing. The recent WHO Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE) guidelines focus on maintaining intrinsic capacity, i.e., addressing declines in neuromusculoskeletal, vitality, sensory, cognitive, psychological, and continence domains, aiming to prevent or delay the onset of dependence. The target group with 1 or more declines in intrinsic capacity (DICs) is broad, and implementation may be challenging in less-resourced settings. We aimed to inform planning by assessing intrinsic capacity prevalence, by characterising the target group, and by validating the general approach-testing hypotheses that DIC was consistently associated with higher risks of incident dependence and death. We conducted population-based cohort studies (baseline, 2003-2007) in urban sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela, and rural and urban sites in Peru, Mexico, India, and China. Door-knocking identified eligible participants, aged 65 years and over and normally resident in each geographically defined catchment area. Sociodemographic, behaviour and lifestyle, health, and healthcare utilisation and cost questionnaires, and physical assessments were administered to all participants, with incident dependence and mortality ascertained 3 to 5 years later (2008-2010). In 12 sites in 8 countries, 17,031 participants were surveyed at baseline. Overall mean age was 74.2 years, range of means by site 71.3-76.3 years; 62.4% were female, range 53.4%-67.3%. At baseline, only 30% retained full capacity across all domains. The proportion retaining capacity fell sharply with increasing age, and declines affecting multiple domains were more common. Poverty, morbidity (particularly dementia, depression, and stroke), and disability were concentrated among those with DIC, although only 10% were frail, and a further 9% had needs for care. Hypertension and lifestyle risk factors for chronic disease, and healthcare utilisation and costs, were more evenly distributed in the population. In total, 15,901 participants were included in the mortality cohort (2,602 deaths/53,911 person-years of follow-up), and 12,939 participants in the dependence cohort (1,896 incident cases/38,320 person-years). One or more DICs strongly and independently predicted incident dependence (pooled adjusted subhazard ratio 1.91, 95% CI 1.69-2.17) and death (pooled adjusted hazard ratio 1.66, 95% CI 1.49-1.85). Relative risks were higher for those who were frail, but were also substantially elevated for the much larger sub-groups yet to become frail. Mortality was mainly concentrated in the frail and dependent sub-groups. The main limitations were potential for DIC exposure misclassification and attrition bias. In this study we observed a high prevalence of DICs, particularly in older age groups. Those affected had substantially increased risks of dependence and death. Most needs for care arose in those with DIC yet to become frail. Our findings provide some support for the strategy of optimising intrinsic capacity in pursuit of healthy ageing. Implementation at scale requires community-based screening and assessment, and a stepped-care intervention approach, with redefined roles for community healthcare workers and efforts to engage, train, and support them in these tasks.

While currently available COVID-19 vaccinations are highly effective in immunocompetent individuals, they are often poorly immunogenic in CLL patients. It is important to understand the role heterologous boost would have in patients who did not respond to the recommended two-dose mRNA vaccine series with a SARS-CoV-2 specific immune response. To characterize the immune response of two CLL patients who failed to seroconvert after initial mRNA vaccine series following a third, heterologous, COVID-19 vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. Two subjects with CLL were enrolled in an IRB-approved observational longitudinal cohort study of the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. After enrollment, they received a third vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. Blood was drawn prior to original vaccination series, four weeks after mRNA vaccination, and again four weeks after third vaccination. Eligible subjects were approached by oncologist overseeing CLL treatment and informed about study, at time of enrollment subjects consented to join the cohort study. Sixteen subjects enrolled in the larger CLL cohort study, of whom two subjects received a third COVID-19 vaccination and were included in this analysis. Subject 1 is CLL treatment naive, while Subject 2 is currently on active treatment. SARS-CoV-2 specific immune response, including plasma antibodies, memory B-cells, CD4 and CD8 T-cells were assessed prior to vaccination (baseline) as well as post vaccination series and post third dose. Of the two subjects who received Ad26.COV2.S doses, Subject 1 seroconverted, had RBD-specific memory B-cells as well as spike-specific CD4 T-cells while Subject 2 did not. Both subjects had a spike-specific CD8 T-cell response after original mRNA vaccination series that was further boosted after third dose (Subject 1), or remained stable (Subject 2). The results of this study, however small, is especially promising to CLL individuals who did not seroconvert following initial mRNA vaccination series.

Despite the increased demand for economic evidence to support resource allocation for scaled-up implementation of mental health services in these contexts, economic evaluations of psychological treatments for CMDs remain scarce. The proposed systematic review aims to synthesize findings on methods and outcomes of economic evaluations of psychological treatments for CMDs in LMICs and appraise quality. We will identify, select, and extract data from published economic evaluations of psychological interventions for CMDs conducted in LMICs. We will search bibliographic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, EconLit, PsycINFO, Africa-Wide Information, Cochrane library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD), Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) Registry), and the African Journals Online (AJOL) and Google Scholar platforms. Only full economic evaluations (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA), Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA), Cost-Consequence Analysis (CCA), or Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)) of psychological treatments for CMDs (defined as depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders) conducted in LMICs will be included. There will be no restrictions based on date of publication, perspective, follow-up duration or sample size. Data extraction will be guided by the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. The results presented will be examined using a narrative synthesis approach. The quality of included studies will be assessed using the Drummond &amp; Jefferson checklist. The fledgling evidence base in this area provides an opportunity to promote improved economic evaluation methods in line with repeated calls for economic evidence alongside effectiveness evidence in these settings. A rigorously developed economic evaluation evidence base will support resource allocation decisions for scaled up implementation of psychological interventions in LMIC settings.

Chile has one of the largest proportions of older adults in Latin America and is currently facing an increase in the number of people with dementia. In this context, the Chilean government has launched a national strategy that involves actions in the health and social care system, including the promotion of DFC. From a multisectoral approach, social and environmental aspects involving engagement with local communities and access to social connections and services are directly related to urban policies. This perspective article focuses on urban aspects of social housing policy, such as placement, networks, affordability and the relationship between subsidy structure and adequate housing provision in a country with a qualitative housing deficit of around 1,200,000 units and where a large proportion of people with dementia and their families live in poverty. We identified several barriers to delivering appropriate environments for people living with dementia in relation to a two-fold problem: (a) the social housing subsidy displaces caregivers and/or older adults to satellite towns where social connections and access to services and urban equipment are lost; and (b) people resisting displacement live in overcrowded neighbourhoods where dementia is a common problem. In both scenarios, a detrimental environment and social conditions directly affect the quality of life of elderly people living with dementia and their caregivers.",2021,1,1,"Frontiers in public health","10.3389/fpubh.2021.662364","PMC8421564","Front Public Health","eng","D000368; D017028; D002677; D003704; D006798; D006801; D011788","Aged; Caregivers; Chile; Dementia; Housing; Humans; Quality of Life",NA,"10.1590/S1980-57642014DN84000003; 10.3389/fnagi.2017.00221; 10.3233/JAD-122086; 10.1371/journal.pone.0172204; 10.1017/S1041610216001654; 10.1097/YCO.0000000000000304; 10.1177/1471301217751533; 10.1016/j.amepre.2009.06.022; 10.1093/ageing/afv137; 10.1017/S1041610217000631; 10.1007/BF00905726; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.01.010; 10.1080/02673037.2015.1070796; 10.1016/j.tra.2020.08.018; 10.1093/geront/gnr098; 10.1186/s13104-016-2254-5; 10.1136/bmj.d4163; 10.1630/0956247053633692; 10.1080/14649365.2018.1509115; 10.1017/S1041610213000057; 10.1002/gps.1453; 10.1001/jama.2017.12067; 10.1016/S1474-4422(15)00101-5; 10.20944/preprints201910.0036.v1; 10.4067/S0250-71612016000100004; 10.29092/uacm.v13i32.525; 10.1080/17450100802095338; 10.1080/02723638.2016.1149311; 10.4067/S0718-83582011000300004; 10.2747/0272-3638.30.5.514; 10.13060/23362839.2020.7.2.512; 10.1037/tra0000793; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61689-4","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","Francisca Cancino-Contreras, Facultad de Arquitectura, Dise&#xf1;o y Construcci&#xf3;n, Universidad de las Am&#xe9;ricas, Providencia, Chile."

We investigate relationships between screen time and mental health, behavioral problems, academic performance, sleep habits, and peer relationships by conducting a series of correlation and regression analyses, controlling for SES and race/ethnicity. We find that more screen time is moderately associated with worse mental health, increased behavioral problems, decreased academic performance, and poorer sleep, but heightened quality of peer relationships. However, effect sizes associated with screen time and the various outcomes were modest; SES was more strongly associated with each outcome measure.

We respond to concerns raised by Smith and Pollak about dimensional models of early experience and highlight the value of these models for studying the developmental consequences of early-life adversity. Basic dimensions of adversity proposed in existing models include threat/harshness, deprivation, and unpredictability. These models identify core dimensions of early experience that cut across the categorical exposures that have been the focus of specificity and cumulative risk approaches (e.g., abuse, institutional rearing, chronic poverty); delineate aspects of early experience that are likely to influence brain and behavioral development; afford hypotheses about adaptive and maladaptive responses to different dimensions of adversity; and articulate specific mechanisms through which these dimensions exert their influences, conceptualizing experience-driven plasticity within an evolutionary-developmental framework. In doing so, dimensional models advance specific falsifiable hypotheses, grounded in neurodevelopmental and evolutionary principles, that are supported by accumulating evidence and provide fertile ground for empirical studies on early-life adversity.",2021,11,1,"Perspectives on psychological science : a journal of the Association for Psychological Science","10.1177/1745691621992346","PMC8563369","Perspect Psychol Sci","eng","D005075; D001921; D006801","Biological Evolution; Brain; Humans","R01 MH103291; R01 MH106482; R37 MH119194; R56 MH119194","10.1017/S0954579413000242; 10.31219/osf.io/caqez; 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.02.004",NA,"Departments of Psychology and Anthropology, University of Utah."

Although measurement invariance is a prerequisite for inferring valid comparisons of AOEs across groups (e.g., age), empirical evidence is lacking. In a secondary data analysis study, we employed regularized moderated nonlinear factor analysis (MNLFA) to simultaneously test differential item functioning (DIF) across age, sex, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and alcohol initiation for a 22-item, two-factor measure of positive and negative AOEs among adolescents (analytic n&#xa0;=&#xa0;936 drawn from a parent study of 1023 adolescents). Evidence of DIF was minimal, with no DIF for the negative AOE factor and DIF for only two items of the positive AOE factor. The item ""feel grown up"" exhibited DIF by age, and the item ""feel romantic"" exhibited DIF by SES. After accounting for DIF, the positive AOE latent factor mean differed by SES, age, and alcohol initiation, and exhibited lower variability by alcohol initiation. The negative AOE latent factor mean differed by sex and SES, with greater variability by SES and age and lower variability by alcohol initiation. Group-differences findings for age and alcohol initiation are consistent with prior work, and differences by sex and SES are a new contribution to the literature that should prompt additional research to ensure replicability. The present study demonstrates the utility of the MNLFA technique for examining comprehensive measurement invariance, particularly for applied researchers who seek to examine substantive research questions while accounting for any DIF present in the scales used.",2022,1,1,"Addictive behaviors","10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.107088","PMC8805203","Addict Behav","eng","D000293; D000294; D005006; D005163; D006801; D010290; D011594","Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Ethnicity; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Humans; Parents; Psychometrics","K01 AA026335; P20 GM130414; R01 AA016838; T32 AA007459; K23 AA024808; T32 DA016184","10.1037/met0000077; 10.1080/10705511.2019.1642754; 10.1037/a0015583; 10.1037/met0000253; 10.1016/0306-4603(94)90007-8; 10.1037/0022-006X.50.3.336; 10.1037/a0035271; 10.1037/0022-006X.71.3.493; 10.1080/00273171.2014.889594; 10.1037/a0027585; 10.1037/pas0000275; 10.1037/1040-3590.5.1.19; 10.1037/0278-6133.21.5.477; 10.1111/dar.12569; 10.1007/s10862-005-0631-9; 10.1007/s10865-007-9098-3; 10.15288/jsad.2015.76.212; 10.1037/adb0000072; 10.15288/jsad.2014.75.404; 10.1037/dev0000430; 10.1016/j.cpr.2011.02.007; 10.1007/s11121-019-0986-x; 10.1037/adb0000537; 10.15288/jsad.2018.79.465; 10.1037/a0024226; 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01304; 10.1037/a0016319; 10.1007/BF02294825; 10.1007/s10964-006-9072-3; 10.1037/0893-164X.19.2.217; 10.4324/9780203775851; 10.1016/j.cpr.2009.06.003; 10.1016/j.cpr.2018.02.002; 10.1093/alcalc/agw048; 10.4324/9781315648002; 10.1177/0956797620959006; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.04.006; 10.1177/0049124121995521; 10.1111/add.12845","Declaration of Competing Interest.

"34486099","Capitalizing on Neuroplasticity Across Development to Redirect Pathways from Juvenile Justice Involvement.","Shannon Chaplo, Diana Fishbein","Adolescence is an exquisitely sensitive period of development during which pathways branch toward success in school and prosocial pursuits or, conversely, toward behavior problems and involvement in high-risk activities and systems, such as juvenile justice (JJ). Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) such as poverty, family dysfunction, and child maltreatment, have been strongly and repeatedly associated with JJ involvement. A significant body of research from neuroscience has established that ACEs can alter facets of neurodevelopment that undergird self-regulation throughout childhood and adolescence, thereby increasing susceptibility to behaviors that attract attention of the JJ system. Because the ability to intervene prior to system-entrenchment is crucial to disrupting an adverse developmental pathway, we look toward neuroscience to offer insights into how to do so more effectively. In this chapter, evidence is summarized that informs an understanding of how neurodevelopmental pathways may lead to JJ involvement. Because neurodevelopment is malleable in response to both detrimental and positive experiences, there is potential for well-targeted interventions to normalize brain and cognitive development, especially during sensitive periods of maturation. This discussion is followed by a proposed research agenda to determine how to exploit these critical windows of opportunity to divert youth from persistent antisocial behavior and JJ involvement. Lastly, a review of neuroscience findings regarding the ability of intervention to strengthen brain systems that modulate self-regulation is presented. This research has direct practical significance with potential to be translated into meaningful policy change.",2022,1,1,"Current topics in behavioral neurosciences","10.1007/7854_2021_251",NA,"Curr Top Behav Neurosci","eng","D000293; D001921; D002648; D006801; D007604; D009473; D012307","Adolescent; Brain; Child; Humans; Juvenile Delinquency; Neuronal Plasticity; Risk Factors",NA,"10.1001/archpsyc.61.4.403; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2008.10.005; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.07.012; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.09.009; 10.1176/jnp.2008.20.3.292; 10.1186/s12916-017-0895-4; 10.1016/j.jcbs.2013.06.001; 10.1056/NEJMra1315612; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2018.04.014; 10.1542/peds.2020-1651; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2012.04.020; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.2988; 10.1037/0012-1649.44.1.286; 10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101703; 10.1007/s10964-018-0934-2; 10.1016/j.dr.2007.08.003; 10.1037/bul0000270; 10.1007/s10567-020-00329-x; 10.1080/10538712.2011.607753; 10.4088/JCP.0706e02; 10.1016/j.psychres.2018.08.097; 10.1111/jcpp.12992; 10.3402/ejpt.v4i0.20274; 10.1146/annurev.psych.093008.100412; 10.1007/s00429-008-0189-x; 10.1007/s13142-015-0376-2; 10.1002/cad.20165; 10.1016/j.dcn.2017.03.006; 10.1007/s10648-005-5728-9; 10.1016/j.tics.2015.07.008; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2017.06.019; 10.1073/pnas.1307893110; 10.1093/cercor/bhp225; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2008.01.007; 10.1017/S0021963099004990; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.04.027; 10.1073/pnas.1909699116; 10.1891/vivi.2003.18.3.319; 10.1111/j.1744-1617.2010.01312.x; 10.1037/amp0000741; 10.1111/j.1745-9125.2002.tb00960.x; 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2015.04.010; 10.1542/peds.2015-3075; 10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00347; 10.1017/S0954579415000140; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113397; 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2016.06.007; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2018.09.005; 10.1002/dev.21968; 10.1177/0011128720926118; 10.1007/978-1-4419-9949-8; 10.1016/j.tins.2020.08.001; 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002328; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07071145; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.05.071; 10.1016/j.neuron.2013.06.028; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.10.012; 10.1146/annurev-devpsych-121318-084950; 10.1017/S0954579400007161; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01823.x; 10.1155/2019/1676285; 10.1016/j.dcn.2011.06.004; 10.1016/j.chc.2015.11.009; 10.1037/a0021441; 10.1080/15325020903004350; 10.1038/nrn3339; 10.1177/0165025411406860; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.04.026; 10.1007/s10964-013-9906-8; 10.1007/s00787-010-0149-x; 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2013.03.006; 10.1016/j.conb.2010.01.006; 10.1016/j.bandc.2009.07.003; 10.1007/s00213-013-3393-1; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01244.x; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.02.023; 10.1080/09602011.2011.605590; 10.1111/jcpp.12507; 10.1016/S0149-7634(03)00007-1; 10.1038/nrn.2016.111; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2010.00971.x; 10.3233/NRE-2011-0709; 10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2015.04.003; 10.18356/27bc31a5-en; 10.1152/jn.00557.2011; 10.1192/bjp.bp.116.181503",NA,"FPG Child Development Institute, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."

We ask whether relationships between SES, brain volumes and cognitive ability differ across cohorts, by age and national origin. European and US cohorts covering the lifespan were studied (4-97&#xa0;years, N&#xa0;=&#x2009;500&#x2009;000; 54&#x2009;000 w/brain imaging). There was substantial heterogeneity across cohorts for all associations. Education was positively related to intracranial (ICV) and total gray matter (GM) volume. Income was related to ICV, but not GM. We did not observe reliable differences in associations as a function of age. SES was more strongly related to brain and cognition in US than European cohorts. Sample representativity varies, and this study cannot identify mechanisms underlying differences in associations across cohorts. Differences in neuroanatomical volumes partially explained SES-cognition relationships. SES was more strongly related to ICV than to GM, implying that SES-cognition relations in adulthood are less likely grounded in neuroprotective effects on GM volume in aging. The relatively stronger SES-ICV associations rather are compatible with SES-brain volume relationships being established early in life, as ICV stabilizes in childhood. The findings underscore that SES has no uniform association with, or impact on, brain and cognition.",2022,2,8,"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)","10.1093/cercor/bhab248","PMC8841563","Cereb Cortex","eng","D000328; D001921; D003071; D066128; D006801; D008136; D012923","Adult; Brain; Cognition; Gray Matter; Humans; Longevity; Social Class","MR/K013351/1; U01 DA041174; U01 DA041156; U01 DA041093; U01 DA041025; U01 DA041148; BB/H008217/1; U01 DA041089; G1001354; MC_QA137853; MC_PC_17228; U54 MH091657; U01 DA041134; U24 DA041147; MC_UU_00030/8; U01 DA041048; U01 DA041106; U01 DA041022; U01 DA041120; U24 DA041123; U01 DA041028; U01 DA041117","10.1001/jamapediatrics.2019.2081",NA,"Center for Lifespan Psychology, Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin 14195, Germany."

Delineating the LTF-regulated genes operative in SCLC could provide a road map to identify SCLC dependencies. We integrated chromatin landscape and transcriptome analyses of patient-derived SCLC preclinical models to identify super-enhancers (SEs) and their associated genes in the ASCL1-, NEUROD1-, and POU2F3-high SCLC subtypes. We find SE signatures predict LTF-based classification of SCLC, and the SE-associated genes are enriched with those defined as common essential genes in DepMap. In addition, in ASCL1-high SCLC, we show ASCL1 complexes with NKX2-1 and PROX1 to co-regulate genes functioning in NOTCH signaling, catecholamine biosynthesis, and cell-cycle processes. Depletion of ASCL1 demonstrates it is a key dependency factor in preclinical SCLC models and directly regulates multiple DepMap-defined essential genes.

"34436609","Characterization of HIV Preexposure Prophylaxis Use Behaviors and HIV Incidence Among US Adults in an Integrated Health Care System.","J Carlo Hojilla, Leo B Hurley, Julia L Marcus, Michael J Silverberg, Jacek Skarbinski, Derek D Satre, Jonathan E Volk","Long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate gaps in HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) care delivery and to identify individuals at risk for falling out of care. To characterize the PrEP continuum of care, including prescription, initiation, discontinuation, and reinitiation, and evaluate incident HIV infections. This retrospective cohort study used data from the electronic health records (EHR) at Kaiser Permanente Northern California to identify individuals aged 18 years and older who received PrEP care between July 2012 and March 2019. Individuals were followed up from date of linkage (defined as a PrEP referral or PrEP-coded encounter) until March 2019, HIV diagnosis, discontinuation of health plan membership, or death. Data were analyzed from December 2019 to January 2021. Sociodemographic factors included age, sex, race and ethnicity, and neighborhood deprivation index, and clinical characteristics were extracted from the EHR. The primary outcomes were attrition at each step of the PrEP continuum of care and incident HIV infections. Among 13&#x202f;906 individuals linked to PrEP care, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 33 (27-43) years, 6771 individuals (48.7%) were White, and 13&#x202f;227 (95.1%) were men. Total follow-up was 26&#x202f;210 person-years (median [IQR], 1.6 [0.7-2.8] years). Of individuals linked to PrEP care, 88.1% (95% CI, 86.1%-89.9%) were prescribed PrEP and of these, 98.2% (95% CI, 97.2%-98.8%) initiated PrEP. After PrEP initiation, 52.2% (95% CI, 48.9%-55.7%) discontinued PrEP at least once during the study period, and 60.2% (95% CI, 52.2%-68.3%) of these individuals subsequently reinitiated. Compared with individuals aged 18 to 25 years, older individuals were more likely to receive a PrEP prescription (eg, age &gt;45 years: hazard ratio [HR], 1.21 [95% CI, 1.14-1.29]) and initiate PrEP (eg, age &gt;45 years: HR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.02-1.16]) and less likely to discontinue (eg, age &gt;45 years: HR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.42-0.52]). Compared with White patients, African American and Latinx individuals were less likely to receive a PrEP prescription (African American: HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.69-0.81]; Latinx: HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.84-0.93]) and initiate PrEP (African American: HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.80-0.95]; Latinx: HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.86-0.95]) and more likely to discontinue (African American: HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.17-1.57]; Latinx: 1.33 [95% CI, 1.22-1.46]). Similarly, women, individuals with lower neighborhood-level socioeconomic status (SES), and persons with a substance use disorder (SUD) were less likely to be prescribed (women: HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.50-0.62]; lowest SES: HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.68-0.76]; SUD: HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.82-0.94]) and initiate PrEP (women: HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.64-0.80]; lower SES: HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.87-.0.99]; SUD: HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.81-0.95]) and more likely to discontinue (women: HR, 1.99 [95% CI, 1.67-2.38]); lower SES: HR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.26-1.57]; SUD: HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.09-1.39]). HIV incidence was highest among individuals who discontinued PrEP and did not reinitiate PrEP (1.28 [95% CI, 0.93-1.76] infections per 100 person-years). These findings suggest that gaps in the PrEP care continuum were concentrated in populations disproportionately impacted by HIV, including African American individuals, Latinx individuals, young adults (aged 18-25 years), and individuals with SUD.

Individuals living in impoverished crowded settings may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19-related stressors. How substantially marginalized groups like impoverished urban-dwelling individuals have been impacted during this pandemic is poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the associated factors of financial concerns and symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19 pandemic among impoverished urban-dwelling individuals residing in Dhaka, Bangladesh. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional survey was conducted between August and September 2020 using face-to-face interviews in six disadvantaged neighborhoods (""slums"") in Dhaka. Individuals were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire consisting of questions assessing socio-demographics, lifestyle, financial well-being relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, depression, and PTSD. <b>Results:</b> Four-hundred-and-thirty-five individuals (male = 54.7%; mean age = 45.0 &#xb1; 12.0 years; age range = 18-85 years) participated. Most (96.3%) reported that their household income decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors associated with decreased household incomes included female gender, primary education, joblessness, food scarcity and depression. Depression symptoms were linked to female gender, joblessness, divorce, living in a joint family, excessive sleep and smoking. Low incomes, excessive sleep, joblessness and food scarcity were positively associated with PTSD symptoms. In contrast, less sleep appeared protective against PTSD. <b>Conclusions:</b> Public health initiatives, in particular mental health services that target stress and biocentric approaches that consider how humans interact with multiple facets of nature, should be introduced to mitigate against potential financial and psychological effects of the pandemic on impoverished urban-dwelling individuals in Bangladesh.",2021,1,1,"Frontiers in psychology","10.3389/fpsyg.2021.663687","PMC8377359","Front Psychol","eng",NA,NA,"UL1 TR001863","10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30567-5; 10.1093/inthealth/ihz092; 10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102014; 10.1007/s10389-020-01432-7; 10.1016/j.puhip.2020.100024; 10.1080/09603123.2020.1802409; 10.1097/00007632-200012150-00014; 10.1007/s11469-020-00307-y; 10.3390/ijerph17165933; 10.1017/S0033291720000999; 10.3389/fpubh.2020.00341; 10.1080/15325024.2020.1763556; 10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8; 10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112934; 10.1186/s12888-020-02866-9; 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.559951; 10.23750/abm.v91i1.9397; 10.1080/23748834.2020.1801114; 10.1007/s42439-020-00031-0; 10.1371/journal.pone.0239254; 10.1093/ntr/ntw140; 10.1111/pcn.13127; 10.1016/j.sleh.2015.10.004; 10.1037/tra0000592; 10.1016/j.jad.2019.06.001; 10.1007/s11469-020-00243-x; 10.1007/s11469-020-00242-y; 10.1093/pubmed/fdaa182; 10.3390/ijerph18041453; 10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.049; 10.21203/rs.3.rs-210877/v1; 10.1177/0020764020954469; 10.1371/journal.pone.0247898; 10.1016/j.abrep.2020.100311; 10.3389/fpsyt.2021.647386; 10.1371/journal.pone.0245083; 10.1186/s12888-021-03246-7; 10.1093/pubmed/fdaa088; 10.1007/s11469-021-00569-0; 10.1016/j.psychres.2014.03.032; 10.1177/1359105320937057; 10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112921; 10.1016/j.smrv.2014.03.006; 10.3390/ijerph14111347; 10.2165/00023210-200620070-00003; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.11.014; 10.1136/jech-2013-202838; 10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_248_17; 10.1016/j.obmed.2020.100216; 10.1097/NMD.0b013e3182214154; 10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05392; 10.1080/13811118.2020.1833800; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106532; 10.2307/2061838; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105912; 10.1037/tra0000703; 10.1177/2167702613498727; 10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04063; 10.1001/jama.282.18.1737; 10.1016/j.psychres.2017.03.036; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2018.05.018; 10.5114/hpr.2021.103123; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105880; 10.1007/s11165-016-9602-2; 10.1080/23748834.2020.1791443; 10.1186/1471-244X-7-57; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105703; 10.1186/s12888-021-03243-w; 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.565153; 10.1186/s12888-018-1591-4; 10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30185-9; 10.3390/ijerph17051729; 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01168; 10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30046-8; 10.1186/s41256-020-00155-2; 10.3390/ijerph17072381; 10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05057","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","Department of Psychiatry and Child Study Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States."

Impact of COVID-19 on mental health in a majority Black American sample of schoolchildren.","Amanpreet Bhogal, Breanna Borg, Tanja Jovanovic, Hilary A Marusak","Children from historically disadvantaged groups (racial minorities, lower socioeconomic status [SES]) may be particularly susceptible to mental health consequences during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the impact of the pandemic, including mental health symptoms and COVID-19-related fears and behaviors, in a sample of majority Black American (72%) children (n=64, ages 7-10, 24 female) from an urban area with high infection rates. Children completed a mental health screening form prior to the pandemic (October 2019) and at two time points during the pandemic (May, August 2020). We examined the impact of SES on mental health changes over time, COVID-19 fears and behaviors, and perceived impact of the pandemic. We also tested whether baseline mental health predicted the impact of COVID-19. Children's fears of illness increased over time, and these effects were independent of race and SES. However, lower SES children reported more fears about social distancing during the pandemic as compared to higher SES children. Lower SES children also reported more internalizing symptoms at baseline, which decreased in this group following stay-at-home orders. Results highlight the need to reduce the risk of persistent fear and mitigate the mental health consequences among vulnerable pediatric populations during and after the pandemic.",2021,10,1,"Psychiatry research","10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114146","PMC8424257","Psychiatry Res","eng","D001741; D000086382; D002648; D005260; D006801; D008603; D058873; D000086402; D014481","Black or African American; COVID-19; Child; Female; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; United States","K01 MH119241","10.1001/dmp.2010.7; 10.1080/15374416.2015.1063432; 10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31481-1; 10.15585/mmwr.mm6932a1; 10.1542/peds.2020-007294; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.09.077; 10.1007/s11469-020-00281-5; 10.1016/j.jpeds.2020.03.013; 10.1007/s10802-015-0009-8; 10.1001/archpsyc.62.6.593; 10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102323; 10.1027/1015-5759/a000495; 10.1111/apa.15270; 10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101845; 10.1002/hbm.23978; 10.1097/CHI.0b013e3181b76697; 10.1002/da.23120; 10.1542/peds.2016-0038; 10.1038/nn.3983; 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6807(200003)37:2&lt;91::AID-PITS1&gt;3.0.CO;2-3; 10.1542/peds.2020-016824; 10.1016/j.jaac.2020.12.027; 10.1073/pnas.2020685118; 10.1056/nejmp2008017; 10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113307; 10.1037/tra0000881; 10.1007/s11136-012-0130-x; 10.1017/dmp.2013.22; 10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.048; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.1619; 10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.001; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105277","The authors declare no conflicts of interest.","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA; Merrill Palmer Skillman Institute for Child and Family Development, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA; Translational Neuroscience Program, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA."
"34419594","Brain parcellation selection: An overlooked decision point with meaningful effects on individual differences in resting-state functional connectivity.","Nessa V Bryce, John C Flournoy, Jo&#xe3;o F Guassi Moreira, Maya L Rosen, Kelly A Sambook, Patrick Mair, Katie A McLaughlin","Over the past decade extensive research has examined the segregation of the human brain into large-scale functional networks. The resulting network maps, i.e. parcellations, are now commonly used for the a priori identification of functional networks. However, the use of these parcellations, particularly in developmental and clinical samples, hinges on four fundamental assumptions: (1) the various parcellations are equally able to recover the networks of interest; (2) adult-derived parcellations well represent the networks in children's brains; (3) network properties, such as within-network connectivity, are reliably measured across parcellations; and (4) parcellation selection does not impact the results with regard to individual differences in given network properties. In the present study we examined these assumptions using eight common parcellation schemes in two independent developmental samples. We found that the parcellations are equally able to capture networks of interest in both children and adults. However, networks bearing the same name across parcellations (e.g., default network) do not produce reliable within-network measures of functional connectivity. Critically, parcellation selection significantly impacted the magnitude of associations of functional connectivity with age, poverty, and cognitive ability, producing meaningful differences in interpretation of individual differences in functional connectivity based on parcellation choice. Our findings suggest that work employing parcellations may benefit from the use of multiple schemes to confirm the robustness and generalizability of results. Furthermore, researchers looking to gain insight into functional networks may benefit from employing more nuanced network identification approaches such as using densely-sampled data to produce individual-derived network parcellations. A transition towards precision neuroscience will provide new avenues in the characterization of functional brain organization across development and within clinical populations.",2021,11,1,"NeuroImage","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118487","PMC8629133","Neuroimage","eng","D000293; D001921; D002648; D003071; D063132; D005260; D006801; D007090; D007206; D008279; D008297; D009434; D059906","Adolescent; Brain; Child; Cognition; Connectome; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Individuality; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neural Pathways; Neuroimaging","R01 MH103291; R01 MH106482; R37 MH119194; R56 MH119194","10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00073; 10.3389/fninf.2016.00002; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.09.025; 10.7717/peerj.784; 10.18637/jss.v067.i01; 10.1073/pnas.1912034117; 10.7554/eLife.32992; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.03.024; 10.17713/ajs.v46i2.561; 10.1016/j.neuron.2017.06.038,.e5; 10.1152/jn.00753.2019; 10.1152/jn.00808.2018; 10.1038/nrn2575; 10.1016/j.dcn.2018.03.001; 10.1073/pnas.1714021115; 10.1038/s41596-018-0065-y; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.03.020; 10.1006/cbmr.1996.0014; 10.1016/j.neuron.2020.01.029,.e8; 10.18637/jss.v031.i03; 10.1177/2515245920954925; 10.1152/jn.00529.2019; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.05.021; 10.1038/s41592-018-0235-4; 10.3389/fnsys.2012.00080; 10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101719; 10.1073/pnas.1208243109; 10.1007/s11682-016-9599-1; 10.1093/brain/awz026; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1324-15.2015; 10.1038/nature18933; 10.1093/cercor/bhu239; 10.1016/j.neuron.2017.07.011,.e7; 10.1038/sdata.2016.44; 10.1016/j.neuron.2018.03.035,.e5; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.01.079; 10.1101/812719; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.04.057; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2019.01.013; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2019.06.013; 10.1093/cercor/bhy123; 10.1016/j.jcm.2016.02.012; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117743; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.12.106; 10.1016/j.neuron.2015.06.037; 10.1073/pnas.1515083112; 10.1093/cercor/bhz255; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117653; 10.1038/s41398-019-0560-0; 10.1007/978-3-319-93177-7; 10.1016/j.neuron.2011.09.006; 10.1073/pnas.1716686115; 10.1002/hbm.23219; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.08.052; 10.1093/cercor/bhx179; 10.1093/cercor/bhy264; 10.2139/ssrn.2694998; 10.1073/pnas.0905267106; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116756; 10.1111/cdev.13005; 10.1093/cercor/bhz066; 10.1007/s10548-019-00744-6; 10.1038/s41598-020-72317-8; 10.1016/j.jaac.2019.08.471; 10.1038/s41467-018-05317-y; 10.1038/nmeth.1635; 10.1152/jn.00338.2011; 10.1016/j.bpsc.2018.12.012; 10.1073/pnas.1900801116",NA,"Department of Psychology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02139, United States."
"34414657","First episode of psychosis in Guam: The role of ethnicity and neighbourhood factors.","Irwin Ford Rosenfarb, Rita Sharma-Gopinath, Vishal Bhavsar","Ethnicity, neighbourhood ethnic density, and four additional neighbourhood factors (urbanicity, crime, voting, and poverty) were examined in relation to the incidence of first episode of psychosis (FEP) in the Pacific Island of Guam. All first contact patients seen at the Guam Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse (DMHSA) between January 2005 and December 2007 that met DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a psychotic disorder were included. At the time of the study, DMHSA was the only psychiatric facility in Guam. After controlling for age and gender, Chamorros, the indigenous people of Guam, had a standardized incidence rate (IR&#xa0;=&#xa0;151/100&#x2009;000 person-years, 95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;129-173) of FEP over twice that of Whites (IR&#xa0;=&#xa0;66/100&#x2009;000 person-years, 95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;34-99). Individuals from Palau had the highest standardized incidence rate (IR&#xa0;=&#xa0;832/100&#x2009;000 person-years, 95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;581-1083). Increased neighbourhood Chamorro density was associated with decreased incidence of FEP among Chamorro individuals (IRR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.11, 95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.03-0.43). After controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, and other neighbourhood factors, urbanicity (IRR&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.82, 95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.86-7.81), voting (IRR&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.06, 95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.32-3.20), poverty (IRR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.94, 95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.40-2.67), and crime (IRR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.18, 95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.00-1.40) remained statistically associated with FEP incidence. The findings add to prior research that suggests that rates of mental health problems are higher in indigenous than in settler communities and are highest for indigenous people who live in neighbourhoods with few other indigenous individuals. Findings also suggest that even on a small island, with only ~150&#x2009;000 people, urbanicity is associated with FEP. Finally, results are consistent with other research suggesting that the reduction of crime and social adversity can play a positive role in reducing the incidence of first episode psychosis.",2022,6,1,"Early intervention in psychiatry","10.1111/eip.13205",NA,"Early Interv Psychiatry","eng","D005006; D006141; D006801; D015994; D011618; D012111","Ethnicity; Guam; Humans; Incidence; Psychotic Disorders; Residence Characteristics",NA,"NA",NA,"Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College, London, UK."

Yet, cumulative cortisol secretion, as measured by hair cortisol, has not been examined longitudinally in relation to change in behavioral problems in young children. The current study examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between hair cortisol and changes in behavior problems in a combined sample (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;88) of two groups of young children from low-income families: 1) A trauma-exposed sample that participated in Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP) (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;43; Mean Age&#xa0;=&#xa0;4.31, SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.16; 53% Female; 77% Hispanic), and 2) A community sample of children from families experiencing high stress (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;45; Mean Age&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.20, SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.29; 67% Female; 58% Hispanic). Cortisol was assayed from hair collected from children at baseline and, on average, one year later. Mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist at the same time hair samples were collected. Baseline hair cortisol in children was not associated with maternally-reported child behavioral problems at baseline and did not predict change in behavior problems over time. In contrast, increases in cortisol were associated with greater improvement in child behavior problems (b&#xa0;=&#xa0;-2.98, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05), controlling for group status and relevant covariates. Subgroup analyses showed that cortisol change across one year significantly differed between the two groups (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.043): on average, community children exhibited a decrease, whereas CPP children demonstrated no change. Hair cortisol concentration was similarly related to improvements in mother-reported behavior problems across both CPP and community groups over time. In summary, there were no cross-sectional associations with hair cortisol, whereas increases were associated with improved child well-being. Findings demonstrate an important link between this increasingly common biomarker and child health, but suggest that changes over time may be more informative than cross-sectional associations.",2021,11,1,"Psychoneuroendocrinology","10.1016/j.psyneuen.2021.105389",NA,"Psychoneuroendocrinology","eng","D015415; D002653; D002675; D003430; D005260; D006197; D006801; D006854; D008137; D008297; D011203","Biomarkers; Child Behavior Disorders; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hair; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Poverty","R01 HL116511; UL1 TR000004","NA",NA,"University of California, San Francisco, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, San Francisco, CA 94103, United States; University of California, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Developmental Medicine, San Francisco, United States."
"34389011","Local experience of using traditional medicine in northern Rwanda: a qualitative study.","Mengxin Tan, Yuko Otake, Teisi Tamming, Valerie Akuredusenge, Beatha Uwinama, Fabien Hagenimana","The popular use of traditional medicine in low-income settings has previously been attributed to poverty, lack of education, and insufficient accessibility to conventional health service. However, in many countries, including in Rwanda, the use of traditional medicine is still popular despite the good accessibility and availability of conventional health services. This study aims to explore why traditional medicine is popularly used in Rwanda where it has achieved universal health coverage. The qualitative study, which included in-depth interviews and participant observations, investigated the experience of using traditional medicine as well as the perceived needs and reasons for its use in the Musanze district of northern Rwanda. We recruited 21 participants (15 community members and 6 traditional healers) for in-depth interviews. Thematic analysis was conducted to generate common themes and coding schemes. Our findings suggest that the characteristics of traditional medicine are responding to community members' health, social and financial needs which are insufficiently met by the current conventional health services. Participants used traditional medicine particularly to deal with culture-specific illness - uburozi. To treat uburozi appropriately, referrals from hospitals to traditional healers took place spontaneously. In Rwanda, conventional health services universally cover diseases that are diagnosed by the standard of conventional medicine. However, this universal health coverage may not sufficiently respond patients' social and financial needs arising from the health needs.

"34388578","Impact of binge drinking during college on resting state functional connectivity.","Tien T Tong, Jatin G Vaidya, John R Kramer, Samuel Kuperman, Douglas R Langbehn, Daniel S O'Leary","The current study examined the longitudinal effects of standard binge drinking (4+/5+ drinks for females/males in 2 hours) and extreme binge drinking (8+/10+ drinks for females/males in 2 hours) on resting-state functional connectivity. 119 college students (61 males) were recruited in groups of distinct bingeing patterns at baseline: non-bingeing controls, standard and extreme bingers. Resting-state scans were first obtained when participants were freshmen/sophomores and again approximately two years later. Associations between longitudinal bingeing (reported during this two-year gap) and network connectivity were examined. Network connectivity was calculated by aggregating all edges affiliated with the same network (an edge is a functional connection between two brain regions). The relationship between longitudinal bingeing and connectivity edges was also studied using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM). Greater standard bingeing was negatively associated with change in connectivity between Default Mode Network and Ventral Attention Network (DMN-VAN; False Discovery Rate corrected), controlling for initial binge groups, longitudinal network changes, motions, scanner, SES, sex, and age. The correlations between change in DMN-VAN connectivity and change in cognitive performance (Stroop, Digit Span, Letter Fluency, and Trail Making) were also tested, but the results were not significant. Lastly, CPM failed to identify a generalizable predictive model of longitudinal bingeing from change in connectivity edges. Binge drinking is associated with abnormality in networks implicated in attention and self-focused processes, which, in turn, have been implicated in rumination, craving, and relapse. More extensive alterations in functional connectivity might be observed with heavier or longer binge drinking pattern.",2021,10,1,"Drug and alcohol dependence","10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108935","PMC8464531","Drug Alcohol Depend","eng","D063425; D001921; D063132; D005260; D006801; D008279; D008297; D009415; D014495","Binge Drinking; Brain; Connectome; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Nerve Net; Universities","R01 AA021165; S10 OD025025","10.1007/s11682-019-00107-6; 10.1002/mrm.1910340409; 10.1016/j.neuron.2014.05.014; 10.1038/srep31293; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.07.044; 10.1038/s41592-018-0235-4; 10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101782; 10.1111/ejn.14108; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.3083; 10.1016/j.amepre.2017.02.014; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.11.026; 10.1006/nimg.2002.1132; 10.1016/j.amepre.2017.12.021; 10.15288/jsa.2002.63.263; 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2010.07590.x; 10.1007/s11065-019-09411-w; 10.4088/JCP.15m09965; 10.1038/srep15181; 10.1111/acer.13475; 10.1101/2020.08.21.257758; 10.1038/jcbfm.2013.223; 10.1016/j.amepre.2009.09.039; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116157; 10.1080/00952990.2019.1601200; 10.1111/acer.12945; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2016.02.025; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.2392; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.01.004; 10.1111/desc.12448; 10.1016/j.neuron.2011.09.006; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.02.064; 10.1146/annurev-neuro-071013-014030; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2007.09.001; 10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101804; 10.15288/jsa.1993.54.369; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116290; 10.1038/nprot.2016.178; 10.1038/mp.2016.25; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2019.05.033; 10.1007/s00213-014-3706-z; 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01435.x; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108119; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.08.057; 10.1177/1073858413494269; 10.1111/acer.12505; 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2006.00122.x; 10.1111/add.12676; 10.1152/jn.00338.2011; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.06.036; 10.1016/j.neuron.2018.03.048","No conflict declared","Department of Psychiatry, Carver College of Medicine, The University of Iowa, 200 Hawkins Dr., Iowa City, IA, 52242, USA."

In this paper, we aimed to validate and explore psychometric properties of the SIS/SES in a sample of 2260 Italian men and women aged 18 to 75&#xa0;years. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the three-factor structure proposed in the original version of the scales fit with our sample. Moreover, our data confirmed the results of the original validation sample: Women scored higher on the SIS and lower on the SES than men did, but no significant differences appeared in the factor scores by age group, except for a gender &#xd7; age interaction, where younger women had higher SIS2 scores. The SIS/SES appeared to be an effective, appropriate cross-cultural measurement of human sexuality in Italian samples, also shedding light on sexual arousal differences in women and men in our country.

"34312626","Social determinants of health exacerbate disparities in COVID-19 illness severity and lasting symptom complaints.","Moriah E Thomason, Cassandra L Hendrix, Denise Werchan, Natalie H Brito","Increasing reports of long-term symptoms following COVID-19 infection, even among mild cases, necessitates systematic investigation into the prevalence and type of lasting illness. Notably, there is limited data regarding the influence of social determinants of health, like perceived discrimination and economic stress, which may exacerbate COVID-19 health risks. The primary goals of this study are to test the bearing of subjective experiences of discrimination, financial security, and quality of care on illness severity and lasting symptom complaints. 1,584 recovered COVID-19 patients that experienced mild to severe forms of the disease provided information about their illness, medical history, lasting symptoms, and psychosocial information. Prevalence data isolated differences in patients infected early versus late in the pandemic. Path analyses examined hypothesized associations between discrimination, illness severity, and lasting symptoms. <i>Post hoc</i> logistic regressions tested social determinants hypothesized to predict neurological, cognitive, or mood symptoms. 70.6% of patients reported presence of one or more lasting symptoms after recovery. Neural systems were especially impacted, and 19.4% and 25.1% of patients reported mood or cognitive/memory complaints, respectively. Path models demonstrated that frequency and stress about experiences of discrimination predicted increased illness severity and increased lasting symptom count, even when adjusting for sociodemographic factors and mental/physical health comorbidities. Notably, this effect was specific to stress related to discrimination, and did not extend to general stress levels. Further, perceived but not objective socioeconomic status (SES) was associated with increased lasting symptom complaints after recovery. Finally, associations between discrimination and illness differed with individual perceptions about quality of medical care. Lasting symptoms after recovery from COVID-19 are highly prevalent and neural systems are significantly impacted. Importantly, psychosocial factors (perceived discrimination and perceived SES) can exacerbate individual health risk. This study provides actionable directions for improved health outcomes by establishing that sociodemographic risk and medical care influence near and long-ranging health outcomes.",2021,7,19,"medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences","10.1101/2021.07.16.21260638","PMC8312905","medRxiv","eng",NA,NA,"R01 MH122447; R01 MH125870; R01 MH126468; R34 DA050287","NA","Competing interests.

Qualitative interviews and focus groups (conducted among a subset of three countries) will explore the views and experiences of young people, families and professionals with regard to poverty, mental health, life chances, and cash transfer programmes. Decision-analytic modelling will examine the potential economic case and return-on-investment from programmes. We will involve stakeholders and young people to increase the relevance of findings to national policies and practice.

However, little study to date has investigated associations between the attribution of poverty and suicide. Though we previously reported associations between socio-cultural factors, including income, and suicide, we tried to explore more focused associations between income, attribution of poverty (individualistic, societal), permissive attitude toward suicide, and suicidal thought using a structural equation model. A total of 2213 participants from each of three nations (South Korea, Japan, and the United States) completed an online survey. Participants without a history of psychological disorders or suicide attempts completed scales measuring attributions of poverty, attitudes toward suicide, and severity of suicidal thoughts. We established a structural equation model, which exhibited a good fit for all nations, and compared significant path coefficients by country. South Korea had the highest severity of suicidal thought and societal attribution of poverty, followed by Japan and America. In all nations, a permissive attitude was positively related to the severity of suicidal thought and individualistic attribution of poverty was positively related to a permissive attitude toward suicide.

During cardiac ischemia, the buildup of acidic metabolites results in decreased intracellular and extracellular pH, which can reach as low as 6.0 to 6.5. The resulting tissue acidosis exacerbates ischemic injury and significantly affects cardiac function. We used genetic and pharmacologic methods to investigate the role of acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) in cardiac IRI at the cellular and whole-organ level. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes as well as ex vivo and in vivo models of IRI were used to test the efficacy of ASIC1a inhibitors as pre- and postconditioning therapeutic agents. Analysis of human complex trait genetics indicates that variants in the <i>ASIC1</i> genetic locus are significantly associated with cardiac and cerebrovascular ischemic injuries. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in vitro and murine ex vivo heart models, we demonstrate that genetic ablation of ASIC1a improves cardiomyocyte viability after acute IRI. Therapeutic blockade of ASIC1a using specific and potent pharmacologic inhibitors recapitulates this cardioprotective effect. We used an in vivo model of myocardial infarction and 2 models of ex vivo donor heart procurement and storage as clinical models to show that ASIC1a inhibition improves post-IRI cardiac viability. Use of ASIC1a inhibitors as preconditioning or postconditioning agents provided equivalent cardioprotection to benchmark drugs, including the sodium-hydrogen exchange inhibitor zoniporide. At the cellular and whole organ level, we show that acute exposure to ASIC1a inhibitors has no effect on cardiac ion channels regulating baseline electromechanical coupling and physiologic performance. Our data provide compelling evidence for a novel pharmacologic strategy involving ASIC1a blockade as a cardioprotective therapy to improve the viability of hearts subjected to IRI.",2021,9,21,"Circulation","10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.054360",NA,"Circulation","eng","D062565; D000818; D002478; D005260; D006801; D057026; D000067268; D008297; D051379; D018345; D017202; D015428; D032383; D020641; D020127; D013111","Acid Sensing Ion Channels; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Female; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Isolated Heart Preparation; Male; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardial Reperfusion Injury; Myocytes, Cardiac; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Recovery of Function; Spider Venoms",NA,"NA",NA,"Institute for Molecular Bioscience (M.A.R., N.J.S., H.S.C., C.Y.C., X.C., Y.S., M.A.H.A., G.F.K., N.J.P.), The University of Queensland, St Lucia, Australia."

In the conditions of poverty and violence that characterise many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), the capacity of parents to provide the kind of care that promotes good child development may be severely compromised, especially where caregivers suffer from depression. One avenue of early intervention focuses on the quality of the early mother-infant relationship. The aim of this study was to examine the long-term impact of an early intervention to improve the mother-infant relationship quality on child cognitive outcomes at 13&#x2009;years of age. We also estimated the current costs to replicate the intervention. We re-recruited 333 children from an early childhood maternal-infant attachment intervention, 'Thula Sana', when the children were 13&#x2009;years old, to assess whether there were impacts of the intervention on child cognitive outcomes, and maternal mood. We used the Kaufman Assessment Battery to assess the child cognitive development and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) to assess maternal mental health. Effect estimates indicated a pattern of null findings for the impact of the intervention on child cognitive development. However, the intervention had an effect on caregiver psychological distress (PHQ-9, ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.17 [CI: -1.95, 0.05] and SRQ-20, ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.30 [CI: -2.41, -0.19]), but not anxiety. The annual cost per mother-child pair to replicate the Thula Sana intervention in 2019 was estimated at ZAR13,365 ($780). In a socio-economically deprived peri-urban settlement in South Africa, a home visiting intervention, delivered by community workers to mothers in pregnancy and the first six postpartum months, had no overall effect on child cognitive development at 13&#x2009;years of age. However, those caregivers who were part of the original intervention showed lasting improvements in depressed mood. Despite the fact that there was no intervention effect on long-term child outcomes, the improvements in maternal mood are important.",2022,3,1,"Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","10.1111/jcpp.13482",NA,"J Child Psychol Psychiatry","</AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Cooper</LastName><ForeName>Peter J</ForeName><Initials>PJ</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading, Reading, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Rathod</LastName><ForeName>Sujit D</ForeName><Initials>SD</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Marlow</LastName><ForeName>Marguerite</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Global Health, Institute for Life Course Health Research, Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch, South Africa.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Fearon</LastName><ForeName>Pasco</ForeName><Initials>P</Initials><Identifier Source=""ORCID"">0000-0003-1847-8443</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Developmental Neuroscience Unit, University College London, London, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng","D000293; D002657; D002675; D003071; D005260; D005500; D006792; D006801; D007223; D009035; D016487; D011247","Adolescent; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Cognition; Female; Follow-Up Studies; House Calls; Humans; Infant; Mothers; Parenting; Pregnancy","MR/S02400X/1","NA",NA,"Developmental Neuroscience Unit, University College London, London, UK."

We aimed to understand how socio-economic status (SES), defined as the Swiss socio-economic position (SSEP), is associated with cardiometabolic parameters after initiation of psychotropic medications known to induce weight gain. Cardiometabolic parameters were collected in two Swiss cohorts following the prescription of psychotropic medications. The SSEP integrated neighborhood-based income, education, occupation, and housing condition. The results were then validated in an independent replication sample (UKBiobank), using educational attainment (EA) as a proxy for SES. Adult patients with a low SSEP had a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome over one year versus patients with a high SSEP (Hazard ratio (95% CI)&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.1 (1.5-6.5), n&#x2009;=&#x2009;366). During the first 6 months of follow-up, a significant negative association between SSEP and body mass index (BMI), weight change, and waist circumference change was observed (25&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;age&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;65, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;526), which was particularly important in adults receiving medications with the highest risk of weight gain, with a BMI difference of 0.86&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> between patients with low versus high SSEP (95% CI: 0.03-1.70, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;99).

PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library. Two independent reviewers performed literature searches. Publications reporting long-term (&#x2265;12-month) hearing outcomes and complications data on adult and pediatric patients with chronic otitis media were included and assessed for risk of bias and strength of evidence. To assess how tympanoplasty influences long-term hearing outcomes, data on pure tone audiometry (air-bone gap) and complications were extracted and synthesized. Thirty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Data from 3162 patients indicated that 14.0% of patients encountered postoperative complications. In adult patients, mean weighted air-bone gap data show closure from 26.5&#xa0;dB hearing level (HL) (preoperatively) to 16.1&#xa0;dB HL (postoperatively). In studies that presented combined adult and pediatric data, the mean preoperative air-bone gap of 26.7&#xa0;dB HL was closed to 15.4&#xa0;dB HL. In 1370 patients with synthesizable data, 70.7% of patients had a postoperative air-bone gap &#x2c2; 20&#x2009;dB HL at long-term follow-up. Finally, subgroup analysis identified that mean improvement in ABG closure for patients with and without cholesteatoma was 10.0&#xa0;dB HL and 12.4&#xa0;dB HL, respectively. In patients with chronic otitis media, tympanoplasty successfully closed the air-bone gap to within 20&#x2009;dB HL in 7/10 cases and had an overall complication rate of 14.0%. 2a.",2021,6,1,"Laryngoscope investigative otolaryngology","10.1002/lio2.576","PMC8223463","Laryngoscope Investig Otolaryngol","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.19082/3823; 10.2471/BLT.13.128728; 10.1097/AUD.0000000000000431; 10.1136/adc.85.2.91; 10.1037/a0029558; 10.2105/AJPH.2007.133215; 10.1186/s12901-018-0051-6; 10.1001/jamaoto.2017.1243; 10.1288/00005537-195608000-00008; 10.1136/bmj.d5928; 10.1177/000348941212100305; 10.1016/j.anl.2016.05.005; 10.1016/j.wjorl.2017.08.004; 10.1155/2018/2431023; 10.1016/j.ijporl.2016.03.027; 10.1007/s12070-014-0749-8; 10.1097/MAO.0b013e3181dbb35e; 10.1177/0003489414526366; 10.1017/s0022215113000121; 10.1017/s0022215110002276; 10.3109/00016480903338131; 10.1007/s12070-017-1177-3; 10.1016/j.anl.2014.08.004; 10.1017/s0022215109005738; 10.1159/000491493; 10.1097/mao.0000000000001795; 10.5152/tao.2018.3200; 10.1017/s0022215114003387; 10.1016/j.anl.2017.11.002; 10.21053/ceo.2017.00549; 10.3109/00016489.2015.1066936; 10.1002/lary.25987; 10.5604/01.3001.0009.3734; 10.1007/s00405-008-0816-4; 10.1177/0194599816633669; 10.5152/iao.2016.2205; 10.1007/s12070-013-0635-9; 10.1111/coa.12974; 10.3109/00016480903559731; 10.1016/j.anl.2014.05.015; 10.1016/j.advms.2013.07.004; 10.3109/00016489.2013.767987; 10.1017/s0022215114002023; 10.1177/000348941112000808; 10.4103/0971-7749.146933; 10.1038/sj.ebd.6400636; 10.5319/wjo.v5.i1.21; 10.1016/j.bjorl.2018.09.005; 10.1017/s0266462312000086; 10.1111/jebm.12266; 10.3342/ceo.2010.3.4.203; 10.1097/MAO.0b013e31816c7c3b","A.

These factors can influence at personal, family and community levels. The interlinked and cumulative impact of these social determinants needs to be ascertained to aid appropriate patient management, as well as to establish prevention and health education programmes. Some of these determinants also have to be recognised at policy level. It is crucial for clinicians to understand the role social determinants play in the genesis and perpetuation of mental and physical illnesses, so that appropriate social interventions can be set in place. Clinicians have a role to play in their clinical practice, as well as advocates for their patients and policy leaders. In order to ensure that health is joined up with other sectors, such as education, employment, judiciary and housing, policy-makers must avoid silos. Every policy must have an impact assessment on physical health and mental health.

"34188584","Vulnerabilities to and the Socioeconomic and Psychosocial Impacts of the Leishmaniases: A Review.","Grace Grifferty, Hugh Shirley, Jamie McGloin, Jorja Kahn, Adrienne Orriols, Richard Wamai","The leishmaniases are a group of four vector-borne neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) with 1.6 billion people in some 100 countries at risk. They occur in certain eco-epidemiological foci that reflect manipulation by human activities, such as migration, urbanization and deforestation, of which poverty, conflict and climate change are key drivers. Given their synergistic impacts, risk factors and the vulnerabilities of poor populations and the launch of a new 2030 roadmap for NTDs in the context of the global sustainability agenda, it is warranted to update the state of knowledge of the leishmaniases and their effects. Using existing literature, we review socioeconomic and psychosocial impacts of leishmaniasis within a framework of risk factors and vulnerabilities to help inform policy interventions. Studies show that poverty is an overarching primary risk factor. Low-income status fosters inadequate housing, malnutrition and lack of sanitation, which create and exacerbate complexities in access to care and treatment outcomes as well as education and awareness. The co-occurrence of the leishmaniases with malnutrition and HIV infection further complicate diagnosis and treatment, leading to poor diagnostic outcomes and therapeutic response. Even with free treatment, households may suffer catastrophic health expenditure from direct and indirect medical costs, which compounds existing financial strain in low-income communities for households and healthcare systems. The dermatological presentations of the leishmaniases may result in long-term severe disfigurement, leading to stigmatization, reduced quality of life, discrimination and mental health issues. A substantial amount of recent literature points to the vulnerability pathways and burden of leishmaniasis on women, in particular, who disproportionately suffer from these impacts. These emerging foci demonstrate a need for continued international efforts to address key risk factors and population vulnerabilities if leishmaniasis control, and ultimately elimination, is to be achieved by 2030.",2021,1,1,"Research and reports in tropical medicine","10.2147/RRTM.S278138","PMC8236266","Res Rep Trop Med","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1093/inthealth/ihv071; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0000599; 10.1111/j.1365-3024.2009.01117.x; 10.4269/ajtmh.2009.81.373; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02279.x; 10.1590/S0074-02762008000700005; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002543; 10.1186/s13071-016-1743-7; 10.1186/s12982-017-0065-3; 10.1186/s12879-015-0830-2; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2006.01604.x; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2010.02520.x; 10.4269/ajtmh.2011.10-0683; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002062; 10.4269/ajtmh.12-0585; 10.1080/14787210.2019.1555471; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003527; 10.3390/pathogens9100809; 10.7554/eLife.02851; 10.35500/jghs.2020.2.e3; 10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00517-6; 10.1016/j.pt.2013.12.004; 10.1111/j.1365-2230.2004.01605.x; 10.4269/ajtmh.15-0408; 10.1186/s12889-018-5260-9; 10.1371/journal.pone.0223313; 10.1371/journal.pone.0242494; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002865; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0007616; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008680; 10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110289; 10.1186/s40249-020-00790-4; 10.1186/s40249-017-0379-y; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2012.02960.x; 10.1093/ije/dym275; 10.7705/biomedica.v36i2.2953; 10.4269/ajtmh.2005.73.74; 10.3329/bjz.v45i1.34197; 10.1590/S0037-86822001000600003; 10.4269/ajtmh.2009.81.195; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0000639; 10.1016/j.pt.2006.09.004; 10.1038/nrmicro1748; 10.1016/j.trstmh.2005.09.017; 10.9745/GHSP-D-20-00028; 10.1590/S0102-311X2009000700025; 10.3109/03639041003796648; 10.1371/journal.pone.0035671; 10.1038/s41591-020-1059-1; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006778; 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13861-5; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2006.01732.x; 10.1128/CMR.00048-18; 10.4103/1596-3519.55704; 10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.03.007; 10.1016/S1473-3099(02)00347-X; 10.1136/bmj.38917.503056.7C; 10.1186/s40249-018-0491-7; 10.1093/cid/cix607; 10.1007/978-3-319-70060-1_6-1; 10.1016/j.ijwd.2016.04.003; 10.1016/j.puhe.2020.05.039; 10.1016/j.ijwd.2019.01.002; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002869; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0007132; 10.1016/j.nut.2019.110712; 10.1186/s13071-014-0470-1; 10.2147/HIV.S143929; 10.1128/CMR.00061-07; 10.1038/s41586-019-1200-9; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2010.02612.x; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003258; 10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.05.011; 10.2147/HIV.S93789; 10.4269/ajtmh.16-0883; 10.3201/eid2205.160042; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0004545; 10.1016/j.trstmh.2007.06.001; 10.5588/ijtld.19.0267; 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60922-3; 10.1007/s11356-020-08896-w; 10.1371/journal.pone.0129869; 10.2807/ese.15.10.19505-en; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0009006; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008925; 10.7759/cureus.11318; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005231; 10.1111/tmi.12916; 10.1126/sciadv.aaq1012; 10.1038/s41558-018-0253-3; 10.3390/ijerph13040443; 10.1016/0140-6736(90)90313-T; 10.1093/ije/25.4.862; 10.1089/vbz.2010.0068; 10.1016/j.ijid.2014.04.023; 10.3201/eid2010.140288; 10.2340/00015555-1988; 10.1603/ME13053; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001407; 10.1186/s13071-018-3019-x; 10.1186/s13071-019-3507-7; 10.1186/s13071-020-04058-6; 10.1186/s13071-020-04448-w; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2010.02516.x; 10.4269/ajtmh.2003.69.624; 10.5812/semj.82810; 10.1155/2018/3025185; 10.1590/0102-311x00136419; 10.1186/1478-4505-11-31; 10.1093/heapol/czn052; 10.1371/journal.pone.0155482; 10.1590/0037-8682-0133-2017; 10.1111/tmi.12994; 10.1186/1471-2334-7-3; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0007092; 10.7241/ourd.20171.21; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0000259; 10.3201/eid1104.040945; 10.18502/jad.v12i2.44; 10.1371/journal.pone.0189906; 10.1186/s12889-017-4132-z; 10.1371/journal.pone.0227911; 10.1371/journal.pone.0203407; 10.1186/s12955-017-0720-y; 10.1093/trstmh/traa160; 10.1073/pnas.1814484116; 10.4269/ajtmh.13-0150; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005781; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006250; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2012.03027.x; 10.1016/S0140-6736(18)30698-6; 10.1093/inthealth/ihu052; 10.5061/dryad.05f5h","All authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.","Department of Cultures, Societies and Global Studies, Northeastern University, College of Social Sciences and Humanities, Integrated Initiative for Global Health, Boston, MA, USA."

The hypothesis that early parenting quality has significant long-term financial benefits has not been previously tested. Design: Longitudinal study with follow-up from 2012 to 2016. UK multicentre study cohort (London, South-East England). 174 young people drawn from 2 samples, one at moderate risk of poor outcomes and one at high risk, assessed aged 4-6&#x2009;years then followed up in early adolescence (mean age 12.1&#x2009;years). The primary outcome was total costs: health, social care, extra school support, out-of-home placements and family-born expenditure, determined through semistructured economic interviews. Early parenting quality was independently assessed through direct observation of parent-child interaction. Costs were lower for youths exposed to more sensitive parenting (most sensitive quartile mean &#xa3;1,619, least sensitive quartile mean &#xa3;21,763; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). Costs were spread across personal family expenditure and education, health, social and justice services. The cost difference remained significant after controlling for several potential confounders. These included demographic variables (family poverty, parental education); exposure to child abuse; and child/young person variables including level of antisocial behaviour in both childhood and adolescence, IQ and attachment security. This study is the first showing that more sensitive early parental care predicts lower costs to society many years later, independent of poverty, child and youth antisocial behaviour levels and IQ. Savings are likely to increase as individuals grow older since early parenting quality predicts health, behavioural and occupational outcomes in adulthood. The findings provide novel evidence for the public health impact of early caregiving quality and likely financial benefits of improving it.",2022,1,1,"Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","10.1111/jcpp.13461",NA,"J Child Psychol Psychiatry","eng","D000293; D000328; D002648; D002675; D017046; D006801; D008137; D010287; D016487; D010290","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Cost Savings; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Parent-Child Relations; Parenting; Parents",NA,"NA",NA,"National Academy for Parenting Research, King's College London, London, UK."

The aim of this paper is to determine the role of demographic and environmental factors such as age, sex, socioeconomic status, parental NF1 status and neurological complications on the cognitive, behavioural and academic outcomes in NF1. Participants included 206 children aged 4-18 years seen within the Manchester clinical research NF1 service. Multiple linear regression models were used to study the effect of the hypothesized predictor variables on cognitive, behavioural and academic outcomes. Relative to population norms, 80% of the NF1 sample demonstrated significantly lower scores in at least one cognitive, behavioural or academic domains. Family history of NF1 and lower SES were independently associated with poorer cognitive, behavioural and academic outcomes. Neurological problems such as epilepsy and hydrocephalus were associated with lower IQ and academic skills. Cognitive and behavioural phenotypes emerge commonly via a complex interplay between genes and environmental factors, and this is true also of a monogenic condition such as NF1. Early interventions and remedial education may be targeted to risk groups such those with familial NF1, families with lower SES and those with associated neurological comorbidities.",2021,8,1,"Journal of psychiatric research","10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.06.002",NA,"J Psychiatr Res","eng","D002648; D003071; D003072; D018479; D006801; D009456; D010290","Child; Cognition; Cognition Disorders; Early Intervention, Educational; Humans; Neurofibromatosis 1; Parents",NA,"NA",NA,"Division of Neuroscience and Experimental Psychology, Faculty of Biological Medical &amp; Health Sciences, University of Manchester, Oxford Road, M13 9PL, UK; Dept of Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK; Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK."

Although there are reviews that have focused on applied interventions from different perspectives, there is still a need for a comprehensive review of what has been attempted with these children from the cognitive intervention field. The aim of this paper is to present a protocol for a systematic review collecting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studies whose purpose was to enhance cognitive development through the implementation of cognitive interventions in children and adolescents (&lt; 18 years old) from low socioeconomic Status (SES) settings. The following databases will be searched: Web of Science (WoS core collection), PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, ERIC, PubMed, ICTRP and Opengrey Register (System for Information of Grey Literature in Europe). Searches will be adapted for each database. Additionally, the reference list of articles included in the review will also be searched. As part of this process, two reviewers will determine, independently, the suitability of each article taking into account predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Pertinent data will then be extracted, including sample characteristics, specifics of the intervention, and outcomes, as well as follow-up measures. Internal validity will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. A quantitative synthesis of results will be conducted using a meta-analysis. However, if a meta-analysis is difficult to implement due to the diversity of the studies (for example, in terms of measures used to estimate the effect size, intervention types, outcomes, etc.), the technique synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) will be used. A description of outcome measures will be provided, as measured by validated neuropsychological instruments of any cognitive function. The systematic review will offer a framework based on evidence to organisations, institutions, and experts who want to implement or promote interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive domains in children and adolescents who live in disadvantaged contexts.

Latin America comprises approximately 8% of the global population and faces unique challenges, many derived from specific demographic and socioeconomic variables, such as violence and inequality. While such factors have been described to influence mental health outcomes, no large-scale studies with Latin American population have been carried out. Therefore, we aim to describe the cognitive performance of a representative sample of Latin American individuals with schizophrenia and its relationship to clinical factors. Additionally, we aim to investigate how socioeconomic status (SES) relates to cognitive performance in patients and controls. We included 1175 participants from five Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico): 864 individuals with schizophrenia and 311 unaffected subjects. All participants were part of projects that included cognitive evaluation with MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery and clinical assessments. Patients showed worse cognitive performance than controls across all domains. Age and diagnosis were independent predictors, indicating similar trajectories of cognitive aging for both patients and controls. The SES factors of education, parental education, and income were more related to cognition in patients than in controls. Cognition was also influenced by symptomatology. Patients did not show evidence of accelerated cognitive aging; however, they were most impacted by a lower SES suggestive of deprived environment than controls. These findings highlight the vulnerability of cognitive capacity in individuals with psychosis in face of demographic and socioeconomic factors in low- and middle-income countries.",2022,8,1,"Psychological medicine","10.1017/S0033291721002403",NA,"Psychol Med","eng","D006801; D007843; D012559; D012923; D012959; D003071","Humans; Latin America; Schizophrenia; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Cognition",NA,"NA",NA,"Programa de Esquizofrenia, da Escola Paulista de Medicina Universidade Federal de S&#xe3;o Paulo (PROESQ-EPM/UNIFESP).

However, it is unclear whether such effects on brain activity translate into behaviourally significant outcomes. Here, we examined differences in automatic imitation between individuals varying in SES and power from the local community population. The automatic imitation task involves participants making actions in response to a symbolic cue while simultaneously being exposed to an action that is incongruent or congruent with the cued response. Patterns of interference in reaction time and error rate reveal the extent to which a person is susceptible to influence from the actions of other-what we refer to as ""the degree of social attunement"". We found that individuals from low SES backgrounds and those in the low power priming group exhibited more interference than individuals from high SES backgrounds and those in the high power priming group. However, we did not observe an interaction between chronic status and the power group.

Health conditions can be both causes and consequences of violence, of shared community-level socio-economic risk factors, and can result from large-scale social forces beyond the control of populations with high levels of violence. The aim of the study was to provide an in depth understanding of the Public Health problem of violence among young adult men in Glasgow East. Ecological investigation of violence and its associations with health conditions in areas of contrasting socioeconomic deprivation. National survey of 1916 British men aged 18-34&#x2009;years, augmented by a sub-sample of 765 men in Glasgow East (GE). Participants completed questionnaires covering current physical and sexual health, psychiatric symptoms, substance misuse, lifestyle, and crime and violence. The 5-year prevalence of violence was similar in both surveys but fights involving weapons (AOR 3.32, 95% CI 2.29-4.79), gang fights (AOR 2.30, 95% CI 1.77-2.98), and instrumental violence supporting criminal lifestyles were more common in GE, where 1 in 9 men had been in prison. Violent men in both samples reported poorer physical and sexual health and all types of psychiatric morbidity except depression, with multiple high-risk behaviours for both future poor health and violence. Associations between drug and alcohol dependence and violence in GE could not be entirely explained by deprivation. Violence in deprived urban areas is one among many high-risk behaviours and lifestyle factors leading to, as well as resulting from, aggregations of both psychiatric and physical health conditions. Poverty partly explained raised levels of violence in GE. Other factors such as drug and alcohol misuse and macho attitudes to violence, highly prevalent among men in this socially excluded community, also contributed. Multi-component preventive interventions may be needed in deprived areas and require future investigations into how multiple co-existing risk factors produce multimorbidity, including psychiatric disorders, substance misuse, poor physical health and violence.",2021,6,12,"BMC public health","10.1186/s12889-021-11167-z","PMC8196543","BMC Public Health","eng","D000374; D006801; D008297; D001523; D015995; D012307; D012606; D014754; D055815","Aggression; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Scotland; Violence; Young Adult",NA,"10.1007/s12117-017-9328-1; 10.1136/jech.2009.095018; 10.1186/s12889-018-5267-2; 10.1016/j.puhe.2017.05.016; 10.1016/j.healthplace.2016.05.007; 10.1590/S1413-81232006000200007; 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135231; 10.1080/09581596.2019.1564223; 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30003-X; 10.1093/ije/14.1.32; 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)11133-0; 10.2105/AJPH.72.12.1336; 10.1093/schbul/sbw006; 10.1093/aje/kwj339; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1983.tb09716.x; 10.1159/000081413; 10.1080/14789940802045182; 10.1017/S0954579400007318; 10.1177/1745691611419672; 10.1016/S2468-2667(17)30118-4; 10.1016/S2215-0366(14)00128-X; 10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30262-5; 10.1016/S2468-2667(19)30248-8; 10.1016/j.ehb.2009.09.005; 10.1111/mcn.12231; 10.1192/bjp.2020.69; 10.1007/s11524-009-9348-5; 10.1177/00333549101250S411; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02222.x; 10.1016/S2468-2667(19)30145-8; 10.1371/journal.pone.0055952; 10.1016/j.amepre.2019.12.022; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002381; 10.1353/dem.2006.0014; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.11.033; 10.1177/1090198113492761; 10.1016/j.healthplace.2012.04.001; 10.4278/0890-1171-10.4.308; 10.1007/s10464-015-9736-9; 10.1016/j.pmedr.2016.08.004; 10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.11.071; 10.1371/journal.pone.0055942; 10.1017/S0033291798008174","None declared.

Using Sprague Dawley rats, the present study explored the impact of limited resource availability on maternal behavior and physiological and emotional behavior outcomes in the offspring. Early life adversity was induced by incorporating aspects of the limited bedding and nesting and scarcity models, wherein limited resource availability has previously been shown to provoke unpredictable or adverse maternal care respectively. In our hands, neonatal limited bedding (NLB) stress during postnatal days (P)2-9 altered maternal care, augmenting pup-directed behaviors and reducing self-directed behaviors, and modestly increased the frequency of transitions between discrete behaviors across consecutive timed observations. NLB-exposed pups had lower core body temperatures immediately following the stressful manipulation and exhibited decreased body weight gain across development.

"34042279","Autistic traits are associated with faster pace of aging: Evidence from the Dunedin study at age 45.","David Mason, Angelica Ronald, Antony Ambler, Avshalom Caspi, Renate Houts, Richie Poulton, Sandhya Ramrakha, Jasmin Wertz, Terrie E Moffitt, Francesca Happ&#xe9;","Growing evidence indicates that the defining characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are distributed throughout the general population; hence, understanding the correlates of aging in people with high autistic traits could shed light on ASD and aging. 915 members of the Dunedin longitudinal birth cohort completed a measure of autistic traits at age 45. A composite measure of the ""pace of aging"" was derived by tracking the decline in 19 biomarkers across ages 26, 32, 38, and 45&#x2009;years. Facial age was also assessed. Reports of perceived health were collected from participants themselves, informants, and interviewers. Higher self-reported autistic traits significantly correlated with a faster pace of aging, older facial age, and poorer self-, informant-, and interviewer-rated health. After control for sex, SES and IQ, autistic traits were significantly associated with each variable: pace of aging (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.09), facial age (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.08), self- (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.15), informant (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.12), and interviewer-rated (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.17) health. Autistic traits measured at age 45 are associated with faster aging. Participants with high autistic traits appear to be more vulnerable to poor health outcomes, as previously reported for those clinically diagnosed with ASD. Therefore, autistic traits may have important health implications. Replicating these findings in samples of autistic people is needed to identify the mechanism of their effect on aging and physical health to improve outcomes for those with ASD diagnoses or high autistic traits. LAY SUMMARY: The role that autistic traits have in relation to health outcomes has not been investigated. We looked at how physical health and aging (measured with self-reported questions and decline in multiple biological measures) were related to autistic traits (measured with a questionnaire, at age 45). We found that higher autistic traits were associated with poorer reports of physical health, and a faster pace of aging. This suggests that both those with autism and those with higher autistic traits may be more likely to experience poorer health outcomes.",2021,8,1,"Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research","10.1002/aur.2534","PMC8328948","Autism Res","eng","D000328; D000375; D000067877; D001321; D006801; D008875; D011795","Adult; Aging; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Humans; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires","R01 AG032282; R01 AG049789","NA",NA,"Social, Genetic, and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."
"34036953","What is the association between post-traumatic stress disorder and unemployment after a disaster?","Carlos Serrano, Marcelo Leiva-Bianchi, Francisco Ahumada, Fernanda Araque-Pinilla","The problem is to determine whether, after a disaster, unemployment is a possible cause of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - the classic model, or whether PTSD is a possible cause of unemployment - the alternative model. The study was conducted on a probabilistic sample of 26 213 adults who provided responses using the <i>Davidson Trauma Scale</i> and lived in regions near or far from the epicenter (Cobquecura, the coast of Chile) of the earthquake and tsunami of February 27, 2010. Independent of the proximity to the epicenter, there is an association between PTSD, unemployment, female sex and the poverty line. For regions close to the epicenter, the alternative model has better adjustment indicators than the classic model. Given the adjustment of the alternative model, the occurrence of PTSD cases is more likely to explain the unemployment condition.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating explicit and implicit memory formation during general anesthesia and its effects on postoperative patient outcomes and recovery. We performed a systematic literature search of Embase, Ovid Medline, and Cochrane Central from inception date until 15 October 2020. Eligible for inclusion were RCTs investigating intraoperative auditory stimulation in adult surgical patients under general anesthesia in which patients, healthcare staff, and outcome assessors were all blinded. We used random effects models for meta-analyses. This study adhered to the PRISMA guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020178087). Fifty-three (4,200 patients) of 5,859 identified articles were included. There was evidence of implicit memory formation in seven out of 17 studies (41%) when assessed using perceptual priming tasks. Mixed results were observed on postoperative behavioural and motor response after intraoperative suggestions. Intraoperative music significantly reduced postoperative pain (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.1 to -0.57; P &lt; 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 0; n = 226) and opioid requirements (SMD, -0.29; 95% CI, -0.57 to -0.015; P = 0.039; I<sup>2</sup> = 36; n = 336), while positive therapeutic suggestions did not. The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis show that intraoperative auditory stimuli can be perceived and processed during clinically adequate, general anesthesia irrespective of surgical procedure severity, leading to implicit memory formation without explicit awareness. Intraoperative music can exert significant beneficial effects on postoperative pain and opioid requirements. Whether the employed intraoperative anesthesia regimen is of influence is not yet clear.

Women (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;7430) were recruited from medical clinics at two large public hospitals in Atlanta, GA, from 2005 to 2017. Women were assessed for sociodemographics, life-course trauma burden, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and major depressive disorder (MDD) utilizing self-report and structured clinical interview assessments. The effects of trauma exposure on current and lifetime PTSD and MDD were examined. Ninety-one percent of women reported trauma exposure, 83% reported a monthly household income of less than $2000, and 41% reported a history of arrest. Regarding psychiatric diagnoses, 30.8% met the criteria for probable MDD, and 32.3% met the criteria for probable PTSD. History of childhood abuse and total lifetime trauma significantly increased PTSD and depressive symptoms with additional incremental trauma exposure. PTSD and depressive symptom scores (95% CI) increased from 5.5 (5.0-6.1) and 8.4 (7.9-9.0) in the no trauma group to 20.8 (20.1-21.5) and 20.4 (19.7-21.2), respectively, in those exposed to four or more types of trauma. These results show high rates of adult and childhood trauma exposure, PTSD, MDD, and an additive effect of lifetime trauma exposure on the development of PTSD and MDD in a sample of low SES African-American women. These findings bring light to the high psychiatric symptom burden in this population and call for increased availability of interventions to address symptoms as well as policies aimed at reducing trauma exposure across the lifespan.",2021,12,1,"Archives of women's mental health","10.1007/s00737-021-01141-4","PMC9261917","Arch Womens Ment Health","eng","D000328; D054523; D001741; D002648; D002649; D003865; D005260; D006801; D013313","Adult; Adult Survivors of Child Abuse; Black or African American; Child; Child Abuse; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Humans; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","M01 RR000039; R01 MH099211; MH069884; K01 MH069884; HD071982; UL1 TR000424; MH115174; MH099211; MH100122; K12 HD085850; U54 AG062334; R01 MH100122; R01 MH115174; R01 HD071982; AG062334","10.1177/1524838009334448; 10.l186/1471-2458-10-20; 10.1097/EDE.0000000000000350; 10.1016/j.jad.2003.12.013; 10.1177/1077801212437908; 10.1037/tra0000264; 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2009.05.003; 10.l176/appi.ajp.l61.8.1417; 10.1353/hpu.2016.0093; 10.1186/1741-7015-7-1; 10.1056/NEJMoa040603; 10.1037/0002-9432.75.l.3; 10.1177/2156869316641730; 10.1002/da.22169; 10.1097/MLR.0b013e31815dc5d2; 10.1081/ada-120006741; 10.1001/archpsyc.64.1.109; 10.1080/15299732.2020.1869098; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2017.04.021; 10.1016/j.janxdis.2010.ll.010; 10.1155/2016/8926840; 10.1176/appi.ps.56.2.212; 10.1002/da.22628; 10.1007/sl0865-006-9067-2","Conflict of interest.

This disparity may, in part, be explained by differences in early environmental experiences and language development. Cognitive stimulation-including language exposure, access to learning materials, caregiver involvement in children's learning, and variety of experiences-varies by SES and may link SES to language development. Childhood language development in turn is associated with academic achievement. In the current longitudinal study of 101 children (60-75 months), SES was positively associated with cognitive stimulation and performance on language measures. Cognitive stimulation mediated the association between SES and children's language. Furthermore, children's language mediated the association between SES and academic achievement 18 months later. In addition to addressing broader inequalities in access to resources that facilitate caregivers' abilities to provide cognitive stimulation, cognitive stimulation itself could be targeted in future interventions to mitigate SES-related disparities in language and academic achievement.",2021,1,1,"Cognitive development","10.1016/j.cogdev.2021.101045","PMC8112571","Cogn Dev","eng",NA,NA,"R01 MH103291; R37 MH119194; K99 HD099203; R01 MH106482; F32 HD089514","10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01019.x; 10.2307/1130131; 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233; 10.1111/1467-8624.t01-1-00382; 10.1177/2372732217720699; 10.2307/1602387; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00675.x; 10.1016/j.ridd.2014.02.003; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01446.x; 10.1080/87565641.2015.1014487; 10.1111/cdev.13065; 10.1146/annurev-linguistics-011516-033854; 10.1037/0012-1649.43.6.1428; 10.1037/t15144-000; 10.1016/j.rssm.2007.03.001; 10.1086/428444; 10.1037/0003-066X.59.2.77; 10.1016/j.ssresearch.2003.08.001; 10.1159/000375515; 10.1111/desc.12019; 10.1037/a0021065; 10.1016/j.jecp.2012.11.005; 10.1044/2016_AJSLP-15-0169; 10.1016/0010-0277(76)90004-4; 10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.003; 10.1111/desc.12246; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2009.11.003; 10.1177/0956797615581493; 10.1111/1467-8624.00612; 10.1080/87565640903325691; 10.1016/j.cogpsych.2010.08.002; 10.1542/peds.2015-3075; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00572.x; 10.1111/cdev.12249; 10.1146/annurev.psych.58.110405.085542; 10.1037/1082-989X.12.1.23; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.2277; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.10.012; 10.1111/cdev.12398; 10.1038/nn.3983; 10.1111/desc.12076; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00600.x; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2005.00876.x; 10.1017/S0954579414000698; 10.1016/j.cogdev.2016.10.001; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01614.x; 10.1177/1745691617718355; 10.1177/0956797617742725; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0484-18.2018; 10.1111/cdev.13315; 10.1016/j.dcn.2019.100699; 10.1016/j.dcn.2019.100731; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.02.043; 10.1017/S0305000907008343; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2012.01805.x; 10.1037/1082-989X.7.4.422; 10.3102/00346543075003417; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2017.10.005; 10.1037/a0020065; 10.1080/10888691.2017.1345634; 10.1111/psyp.12547; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2010.09.002; 10.1111/cdev.13364; 10.1016/j.dr.2015.07.001",NA,"Department of Psychology, Harvard University."

Little is known, however, about SES-related differences underlying higher-order cognitive skills that are critical for school success, such as reasoning. Here we used fMRI to examine how the neurocognitive basis of deductive reasoning varies as a function of parental education in school-aged children. Higher parental education was associated with greater reliance on the left inferior frontal gyrus when solving set-inclusion problems, consistent with other work suggesting that these problems might more heavily rely on verbal systems in the brain. In addition, children who are at the lower end of the parental education continuum, but have higher nonverbal skills relied on right parietal areas to a greater degree than their peers for solving set-inclusion problems. Finally, lower parental education children with higher verbal or nonverbal skill engaged dorsolateral prefrontal regions to a greater degree for set-inclusion and linear-order relations than their peers. These findings suggest that children with lower parental education rely on spatial and cognitive control mechanisms to achieve parity with their peers with parents who have more education. Better understanding variability in the neurocognitive networks that children recruit as a function of their parental factors might benefit future individualized interventions that best match children's characteristics.",2021,8,1,"Human brain mapping","10.1002/hbm.25441","PMC8249891","Hum Brain Mapp","eng","D000293; D002648; D004522; D005260; D059907; D006801; D008279; D008297; D009415; D010290; D010296; D017397; D011340; D012923","Adolescent; Child; Educational Status; Female; Functional Neuroimaging; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Nerve Net; Parents; Parietal Lobe; Prefrontal Cortex; Problem Solving; Social Class","P50 HD103537; R01 HD059177; HD059177","10.1006/nimg.2000.0636","The authors have no conflict of interest to declare.","Department of Psychology and Human Development, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA."

The present review aimed to update a published review of 5 years of empirical studies on universal parenting programs to strengthen positive parenting and prevent child maltreatment. A systematic search of the PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Lilacs, and SciELO databases was performed to identify the studies of group-based structured parenting programs published from 2015 to 2019. Eighteen studies were found that fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results showed that 14 different parenting programs were conducted in high-, medium-, and low-income countries, showing an increase in the number of studies in low-income countries compared with the previous review. In 89% of the studies, the parenting outcomes improved in the post-intervention. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that these programs also improved other parental outcomes such as mental health, couple relationships, coparenting, and coping ability of parents. From 18 studies, nine child variables were evaluated, and eight of them showed a decrease in behavior problems. Regarding the methodological quality of the studies, 55%, 28%, and 17% were classified as moderate, weak, and strong, respectively. In conclusion, the positive changes in parenting and child behavior outcomes encourage the implementation of parenting programs as a universal prevention strategy.

"33971502","Executive function as a mechanism linking socioeconomic status to internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in children and adolescents.","Elizabeth A McNeilly, Matthew Peverill, Jiwon Jung, Katie A McLaughlin","The association between low socioeconomic status (SES) in childhood and increased risk for psychopathology is well established, but the mechanisms explaining this relationship are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the potential role of difficulties in executive functioning (EF) as a mechanism linking childhood and adolescent SES with externalizing and internalizing psychopathology. We examined whether difficulties with EF mediated the association between SES and externalizing and internalizing psychopathology in two cross-sectional samples of children and adolescents (Study 1: N&#xa0;=&#xa0;94, ages 6-18, 51.1% male; Study 2: N&#xa0;=&#xa0;259, ages 8-16, 54.1% male) from diverse SES backgrounds in the United States. EF was measured through behavioral tasks and parent-reported behavioral regulation (BR). In both samples, children and adolescents from lower SES families were more likely to experience both externalizing and internalizing psychopathology than youth from more advantaged backgrounds and exhibited greater EF difficulties - they had lower performance on a task measuring inhibitory control and lower parent-rated BR. Reduced inhibitory control and BR, in turn, were associated with higher externalizing and internalizing psychopathology. In Study 1, difficulties with BR mediated the association of low-SES with both externalizing and internalizing psychopathology. In Study 2, low inhibitory control mediated the association between low-SES and externalizing psychopathology. These findings largely persisted after adjusting for exposure to violence, a form of adversity that is common in children from low-SES backgrounds. These findings suggest that reduced EF may be an underlying mechanism through which low-SES confers risk for psychopathology in children and adolescents.",2021,6,1,"Journal of adolescence","10.1016/j.adolescence.2021.04.010","PMC8203104","J Adolesc","eng","D000293; D002648; D003430; D056344; D005260; D006801; D008297; D001523; D011599; D012923","Adolescent; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Psychopathology; Social Class","R01 MH103291; R01 MH106482","10.1002/dev.21794; 10.1207/153744202753604511; 10.1097/00004583-199703000-00012; 10.1016/S0145-2134(02)00541-0; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01499.x; 10.1017/S0954579408000436; 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233; 10.1080/09297040903146966; 10.2307/1602387; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08139.x; 10.1097/00004583-199705000-00011; 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01242; 10.1037/0022-006X.62.5.1017; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01446.x; 10.2307/1131385; 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.121208.131208; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2009.09070931; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2008.07.002; 10.1016/j.brainres.2006.06.072; 10.5406/amerjpsyc.127.4.0419; 10.1016/j.cortex.2016.04.023; 10.1111/j.1530-0277.1996.tb01680.x; 10.1076/chin.6.3.235.3152; 10.1076/chin.8.4.249.13513; 10.1016/j.jad.2006.03.007; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2009.186; 10.1111/desc.12246; 10.1016/j.janxdis.2017.10.007; 10.1023/A:1022641916705; 10.1017/S0954579417001602; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2011.02454.x; 10.1016/j.cogpsych.2010.08.002; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2012.09.008; 10.1017/S0033291720000641; 10.1007/s10608-006-9035-8; 10.1080/02699930903407948; 10.1038/s41398-019-0616-1; 10.1016/j.janxdis.2006.10.012; 10.1017/S0954579416000584; 10.1111/desc.12529; 10.1007/s10802-016-0260-7; 10.1177/1087054706292115; 10.1080/15374416.2015.1110823; 10.2105/AJPH.2011.300477; 10.1016/j.jaac.2012.09.009; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.2277; 10.1177/0963721416655883; 10.1037/0003-066X.53.2.185; 10.1037/a0030244; 10.1177/0963721411429458; 10.1006/cogp.1999.0734; 10.1016/j.cogdev.2006.01.007; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00600.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2005.00394.x; 10.1017/S0954579405050029; 10.1016/j.cpr.2020.101933; 10.1037/a0028343; 10.1037/a0022585; 10.1111/cdev.13315; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.02.043; 10.18637/jss.v048.i02; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2012.01805.x; 10.1080/00220671.2014.979913; 10.1017/S1355617710001335; 10.1007/s10802-012-9684-x; 10.1371/journal.pone.0035744; 10.1097/00004583-201005000-00005; 10.1007/s10608-019-10016-z; 10.1177/1073191120965694; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2018.09.008; 10.1017/S0033291715002020; 10.1007/s10802-016-0184-2; 10.1111/jora.12270; 10.1017/S0954579419000348; 10.1016/j.jaac.2019.08.471; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.02.006; 10.1016/S2214-109X(16)30100-0; 10.1002/9780470996652.ch20; 10.1111/j.1750-8606.2011.00176.x","<b>Declarations of Interest:</b> none.","Department of Psychology, Harvard University, USA."
"33960057","Drinking and acquisition of unrecorded alcohol across educational groups in Sweden.","Thor Norstr&#xf6;m, Jonas Landberg, Bj&#xf6;rn Trolldal","It is estimated that 18.5% of total alcohol consumption in Sweden in 2018 was unrecorded. However, little is known about the socio-economic profile of consumers of unrecorded alcohol. The aim of this study was to elucidate this issue by analysing data from a unique Swedish national repeated cross-sectional alcohol use survey. Individual-level information on alcohol consumption and socio-economic status (SES) for the years 2013-2018 was retrieved from the Monitoring Project; a nationally representative monthly alcohol use survey. The analytical sample comprised 64&#x2009;375 respondents aged 25-74&#x2009;years. SES was measured by educational level. We used three educational groups: (i) low (&lt;10&#x2009;years); (ii) intermediate (10-12&#x2009;years); and (iii) high (13+ years). We included indicators of the following sources of unrecorded alcohol consumption: travellers' import, smuggled alcohol, home production, internet and illicit home-distilling. We estimated adjusted SES-specific means of the various forms of unrecorded consumption. The means were adjusted for the effects of age, sex and region. There were no significant educational differences in the total of unrecorded alcohol consumption; the same holds true for home-production and internet. However, with respect to smuggled and home-distilling, a statistically significant educational gradient was observed with the lowest educational group scoring approximately four times higher than the highest. Our findings suggest that there are no differences across educational groups in the consumption of unrecorded alcohol as a whole. However, consumption of smuggled alcohol and illicitly distilled spirits is elevated in the low educational group.",2022,1,1,"Drug and alcohol review","10.1111/dar.13304",NA,"Drug Alcohol Rev","eng","D000328; D000368; D000428; D000434; D003430; D000431; D006801; D008875; D013548","Adult; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholic Beverages; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethanol; Humans; Middle Aged; Sweden",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden."

The purpose of the symposium was to share neuroscience nursing research from around the world. One of the topics thought most notable that stimulated a crucial conversation was how different countries assessed pain and their use of opioids for pain management. BACKGROUND: Neuroscience nurses are global. What is not known is their experience with and what challenges exist with pain management for human beings in their country. Crossing geographic and cultural boundaries, pain affects all human beings. Each culture has unique values and beliefs regarding pain. Patient barriers, pivotal in this article, included poverty, poor health literacy, opioid phobia, and cultural as well as social beliefs. RESULTS: Neuroscience nurses from Australia, Brazil, Germany, Singapore, India, Ghana, Kenya, Philippines, South Africa, and the United States each collaborated to provide a short summary of assessing pain and use of opioids for pain management for the neuroscience patient. CONCLUSION: Neuroscience patients have varying degrees of pain based on many factors. Various countries have religious, spiritual, and cultural traditions that influence the reporting and management of pain. Pain assessment and management can be challenging, especially for the neuroscience nurses around the world.",2021,6,1,"The Journal of neuroscience nursing : journal of the American Association of Neuroscience Nurses","10.1097/JNN.0000000000000585",NA,"J Neurosci Nurs","eng","D000701; D006801; D065816; D015399; D010146; D010147; D014481","Analgesics, Opioid; Humans; Neuroscience Nursing; Nursing Research; Pain; Pain Measurement; United States",NA,"10.1016/j.ejpain.2011.05.006; 10.1016/j.jpain.2008.04.004; 10.2147/JPR.S197803; 10.1093/pm/pnw237; 10.1016/j.jpain.2007.02.430; 10.1177/106939710003400203; 10.4103/0973-1075.197955; 10.1136/jme.2006.018887; 10.1016/S1754-3207(08)60007-3; 10.37719/jhcs.2019.v1i2.rna004; 10.1024/1012-5302/a000687; 10.1024/1012-5302/a000717; 10.1051/fopen/2019007; 10.1097/JNN.0000000000000446; 10.1097/JNN.0000000000000093; 10.1093/pch/pxx126","The authors declare no conflicts of interest.",NA

Disease-modifying therapies (DMT) directly impact on the long-term prognosis of patients with MS preventing relapses and the associated disability progression. Here, we analyzed the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on DMT access in Mexican patients. We evaluated the association between SES and DMT access using the MS registry from the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery in Mexico City. We included 974 patients with MS (McDonald 2010 criteria). We categorized SES according to the 2018 Mexican Association of Market Research Agencies (AMAI) SES classification. We analyzed DMT type, MS phenotype, educational level, symptomatic onset to diagnosis, EDSS at arrival, as well as the progression index. Chi-squared and Wilcoxon tests were used, and multivariable analysis performed for DMT access. When comparing the lower versus higher levels of SES, a significant association was found on the percentage of patients with higher levels of disability (EDSS &gt;6) at arrival, the proportion of patients not receiving any DMT and a higher proportion of secondary progressive MS (p=0.006, p&lt;0.001and p=0.004, respectively). We also found that lower educational levels had a significance and inverse association with EDSS on first visit (p=0.019), symptomatic onset to diagnosis (p&lt;0.001) and a higher disability status at arrival (EDSS &gt;6, p=0.010). Our study suggests that SES is an important factor determining not only prompt but overall access to highly effective DMT. Lower SES are associated with greater levels of disability at the first clinic visit and a higher proportion of patients not receiving DMT up to 12 months of follow-up.",2021,7,1,"Multiple sclerosis and related disorders","10.1016/j.msard.2021.102967",NA,"Mult Scler Relat Disord","eng","D006801; D008800; D009103; D020528; D012008; D012923","Humans; Mexico; Multiple Sclerosis; Multiple Sclerosis, Chronic Progressive; Recurrence; Social Class",NA,"NA",NA,"Multiple Sclerosis and Demyelinating Disorders Clinic, National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Mexico City, Mexico."

Here we review evidence that experiences associated with childhood SES affect not only the outcome but also the pace of brain development. We argue that higher childhood SES is associated with protracted structural brain development and a prolonged trajectory of functional network segregation, ultimately leading to more efficient cortical networks in adulthood. We hypothesize that greater exposure to chronic stress accelerates brain maturation, whereas greater access to novel positive experiences decelerates maturation. We discuss the impact of variation in the pace of brain development on plasticity and learning.

This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the evidence on the effectiveness of cash transfers to improve the mental health of children and young people in low-income and middle-income countries. We searched Pubmed, EBSCOhost, Scientific Electronic Library Online, ISI Web of Science and Social Sciences Citation Index and grey literature (from January 2000 to July 2020) for studies which quantitatively assessed the impact of cash transfers on mental health in young people (aged 0-24 years), using a design that incorporated a control group. We extracted Cohen's d effects size and used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis on studies that measured depressive symptoms, I<sup>2</sup> statistic and assessment of study quality. We identified 12&#x2009;116 articles for screening, of which 12 were included in the systematic review (covering 13 interventions) and seven in the meta-analysis assessing impact on depressive symptoms specifically. There was high heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>=95.2) and a high risk of bias (0.38, 95% CIs: -5.08 to 5.85; p=0.86) across studies. Eleven interventions (85%) showed a significant positive impact of cash transfers on at least one mental health outcome in children and young people. However, no study found a positive effect on all mental health outcomes examined, and the meta-analysis showed no impact of cash transfers on depressive symptoms (0.02, 95% CIs: -0.19 to 0.23; p=0.85). Cash transfers may have positive effects on some mental health outcomes for young people, with no negative effects identified.

We conducted a scoping review of reviews to determine key barriers and innovative strategies which can contribute to attaining universal health coverage (UHC), from early detection to effective interventions for autism in low- and middle-income countries (LAMIC). A systematic literature search of review articles was conducted. Reviews relevant to the study research question were included if they incorporated papers from LAMIC and focused on children (&lt;eight years old) with autism or their caregivers. The database search was supplemented with bibliographic search of included articles and key informant suggestions. Data were extracted and mapped onto a Theory of Change model toward achieving UHC for autism in LAMIC. We identified 31 articles which reviewed data from over fifty countries across Africa, Latin America, Middle East, and Asia and addressed barriers across one or more of four inter-related domains: (a) the social context and family experience for a child with autism; (b) barriers to detection and diagnosis; (c) access to appropriate evidence-based intervention; and (d) social policy and legislation. Key barriers identified included: lack of appropriate tools for detection and diagnosis; low awareness and experienced stigma impacting demand for autism care; and the prevalence of specialist models for diagnosis and treatment which are not scalable in LAMIC. We present a Theory of Change model which describe the strategies and resources needed to realize UHC for children with autism in LAMIC. We highlight the importance of harnessing existing evidence to best effect, using task sharing and adapted intervention strategies, community participation, and technology innovation.

We conducted a prospective analysis of the outcomes of 251 patients, hospitalized throughout 2019 for an exacerbation of CHF. The sample was divided into two groups: group A - 153 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD); group B - 98 patients without clinical depression. We analyzed the associations between socioeconomic status (SES) and the severity of depressive symptoms, pharmacotherapy, readmission, and mortality rates within 30 days and at one year. We classified patients' SES according to residence, income, education level, and family support. Quality of Life (QL) total scores were also assessed. The severity of mental health complaints was evaluated using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Ratings (MADRS) scale; individual somatic evaluation included the analysis of the alteration of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), as well as details regarding pharmacotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers (BB). The patient sample appeared uniform in terms of SES and CHF pharmacotherapy. The main differences were the presence of comorbid MDD, with 60.91% of patients having clinical depression. These patients also reported a lower QL, reduced LVEF, more frequent, and extended hospitalizations with an overall higher one-year mortality than patients without MDD. Although depression is considered a risk factor for adverse outcomes in older adults with CHF, in our research, its impact was significantly associated with a reduced QL, but the association with a lower SES was inconclusive. MDD is a frequent comorbidity in patients with CHF, and is associated with a reduced LVEF and QL. Our results showed that, despite a similar therapeutic regimen, patients with comorbid MDD required more frequent, prolonged admissions and higher one-year mortality rates than those without MDD.",2021,1,1,"Rivista di psichiatria","10.1708/3594.35769",NA,"Riv Psichiatr","eng","D000368; D003865; D006333; D006801; D008603; D011788; D012923; D013318; D016277","Aged; Depressive Disorder, Major; Heart Failure; Humans; Mental Health; Quality of Life; Social Class; Stroke Volume; Ventricular Function, Left",NA,"NA",NA,"County Clinical Emergency Hospital ""Pius Brinzeu"" Timisoara - Neuroscience Department VIII, Discipline of Psychiatry, University of Medicine and Pharmacy ""Victor Babes"" Timisoara."

Crack-cocaine users are usually embedded in a context of great social vulnerability, often associated with violence, poverty, family conflict and easy and early access to alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. This cross-sectional study enrolled a consecutive sample of 577 patients admitted to 20 therapeutic communities located in Southern Brazil, between September 2012 and September 2013. A structured interview assessed life-time exposure to risk and protective factors for drug use, such as parental monitoring in childhood, deviant behaviors and peer pressure. Presence of family conflict (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), maltreatment (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.016), and deviant behavior prior to age 15 in a bivariate analysis predicted an earlier age of crack-cocaine initiation, whereas adolescents experiencing parental monitoring during adolescence started use later (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). In the multivariate model, perceptions related to ease of access of illicit drugs (marijuana: p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.028, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#x2009;3.81, -&#x2009;0.22; crack-cocaine: p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#x2009;7.40, -&#x2009;4.90), and deviant behavior (threatening someone with a gun: p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.028, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#x2009;2.57, -&#x2009;0.14) remained independent predictors of early age of crack-cocaine initiation. Early onset of crack-cocaine use seems to be associated with exposure to family conflict, easy access to drugs and deviant behavior.

Data were extracted from EHRs of 3350 people (62% male patients) who had presented to the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust with a FEP between 1 April 2007 and 31 March 2017. Logistic regression was used to examine gender differences in the presentation of positive, negative, depressive, mania and disorganisation symptoms. Gender (male vs female). Presence of positive, negative, depressive, mania and disorganisation symptoms at initial clinical presentation. Eight symptoms were significantly more prevalent in men (poverty of thought, negative symptoms, social withdrawal, poverty of speech, aggression, grandiosity, paranoia and agitation). Conversely, tearfulness, low energy, reduced appetite, low mood, pressured speech, mood instability, flight of ideas, guilt, mutism, insomnia, poor concentration, tangentiality and elation were more prevalent in women than men. Negative symptoms were more common among men (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.62) and depressive and manic symptoms more common among women (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.35). After adjustment for illicit substance use, the strength of associations between gender and negative, manic and depression symptoms increased, whereas gender differences in aggression, agitation, paranoia and grandiosity became insignificant. There are clear gender differences in the clinical presentation of FEP. Our findings suggest that gender can have a substantial influence on the nature of clinical presentation in people with psychosis, and that this is only partly explained by exposure to illicit substance use.",2021,4,20,"BMJ open","10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042949","PMC8061860","BMJ Open","eng","D004581; D005260; D006801; D008131; D008297; D009323; D011618; D012727; D019966","Electronics; Female; Humans; London; Male; Natural Language Processing; Psychotic Disorders; Sex Characteristics; Substance-Related Disorders","MC_PC_17214; MR/T045302/1; MR/S003118/1","10.1002/wps.20490; 10.1371/journal.pone.0031660; 10.1007/s00737-018-0847-9; 10.1155/2012/916198; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2012.11.005; 10.1155/2015/430735; 10.1111/eip.12235; 10.1093/schbul/22.2.257; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2009.36; 10.1016/j.schres.2009.07.002; 10.1007/s00127-008-0384-3; 10.1017/S0033291718000399; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2016.09.003; 10.1186/s12888-014-0256-1; 10.1093/schbul/sbx197; 10.1016/S2215-0366(16)30379-0; 10.1007/s00281-018-0723-8; 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012012; 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-028929; 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-007619; 10.3389/fpsyt.2020.577110; 10.1017/S0033291709990651; 10.1016/j.schres.2006.07.018; 10.1097/01.nmd.0000253784.59708.dd; 10.1136/bmj.323.7325.1336; 10.1155/2015/615356; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.5; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00554.x; 10.1016/S0920-9964(00)00114-6; 10.1016/S0924-9338(03)00027-0; 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.968792","Competing interests: All authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure form at www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf and declare: RS has received research funding from Roche, Janssen, GSK and Takeda.

One concern is the potential impact of genomics research on stigma experienced by people affected by a disease. Studies have found that the type of illness as well as disease causal beliefs impact on the relation between genetic attribution and stigma. This study explored the potential impact of genetic attribution of disease on stigma among Xhosa people with Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD). Study participants were 46 Xhosa people with RHD living in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Using video vignettes in 7 focus group discussions we explored whether and how genetic attribution may impact on disease-stigma. Vignettes introduced participants to non-genetic and genetic causal explanations and were followed-up with a series of open-ended questions eliciting their perceptions of non-genetic disease causes as well as genetic causation and its impact on internalised stigma. This study found that Xhosa people with RHD have a general understanding of genetics and genetic attribution for disease. Additionally, and not withstanding their genetic knowledge, these participants hold multiple disease causal beliefs including genetic, infectious disease, psychosocial, behavioural and cultural explanations. While there was evidence of internalised stigma experiences among participants, these appeared not to be related to a genetic attribution to the disease. The findings of this study provide clues as to why it is unlikely that a genetic conceptualisation of disease impacts internalised stigma experiences of Xhosa people. The causal explanations provided by participants reflect their cultural understandings and their context, namely, living in low-income and poverty-stricken environments. Divergence in these findings from much of the evidence from high-income countries emphasises that context matters when considering the impact of genetic attribution on stigma and caution against generalising findings from one part of the globe to another.",2021,5,1,"Social science &amp; medicine (1982)","10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113902","PMC8450780","Soc Sci Med","eng","D044383; D017144; D023281; D006801; D057545; D013019","Black People; Focus Groups; Genomics; Humans; Social Stigma; South Africa","U01 HG008226; U24 HL135600; U54 HG009790","NA","<b>Competing interests:</b> All authors state that there is no conflict of interest.","Department of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa."

PRESSED Project Study Protocol.","Mireia Bolibar, Francesc Xavier Belvis, Pere J&#xf3;dar, Alejandra Vives, Fabrizio M&#xe9;ndez, Xavier Bartoll-Roca, Oscar J Pozo, Alex Gomez-Gomez, Eva Padrosa,  ..., Mireia Juli&#xe0;","The PRESSED project aims to explain the links between a multidimensional measure of precarious employment and stress and health. Studies on social epidemiology have found a clear positive association between precarious employment and health, but the pathways and mechanisms to explain such a relationship are not well-understood. This project aims to fill this gap from an interdisciplinary perspective, integrating the social and biomedical standpoints to comprehensively address the complex web of consequences of precarious employment and its effects on workers' stress, health and well-being, including health inequalities. The project objectives are: (1) to analyze the association between multidimensional precarious employment and chronic stress among salaried workers in Barcelona, measured both subjectively and using biological indicators; (2) to improve our understanding of the pathways and mechanisms linking precarious employment with stress, health and well-being; and (3) to analyze health inequalities by gender, social class and place of origin for the first two objectives. The study follows a sequential mixed design. First, secondary data from the 2017 Survey on Workers and the Unemployed of Barcelona is analyzed (<i>N</i> = 1,264), yielding a social map of precarious employment in Barcelona that allows the contextualization of the scope and characteristics of this phenomenon. Drawing on these results, a second survey on a smaller sample (<i>N</i> = 255) on precarious employment, social precariousness and stress is envisaged.

The aim of the present study was to determine the possible role of socioeconomic status (SES) and stressful events in PPMS development METHODS: The present population-based case-control study recruited PPMS cases and healthy controls from the general population during 2019-2020 in Tehran, Iran. Clinical diagnosis of cases was based on the 2017 McDonald criteria and confirmed by a neurologist. The selection of sex-matched controls from the same source population of cases was performed using the standard method of Random Digit Dialing (RDD). The study questionnaire was filled out over telephone interviews. Matched logistic regression was administered to estimate the adjusted and unadjusted odds ratio (OR) at 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for sex, age, and marital status using SPSS 23. This study examined 146 PPMS cases and 294 controls. Mean ages (SD) for cases and controls were 46.97 (9.4) and 37.67 (6.12), respectively (P &lt; 0.001). No stressful events over five years prior to the disease onset were associated with an increased risk of PPMS. Marriage (OR: 0.04; 95% CI (0.01- 0.37), P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004), close family members' serious disease (OR: 0.10; 95% CI (0.02-0.60), P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.01), and being in debt (OR: 0.03; 95% CI (0-0.37), P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.006) were found to have a negative association with the risk of disease occurrence. Death of a loved one, family disruption, jail term, homelessness period, Conquer(national university entrance exam), death of spouse, getting fired from a job, joblessness, divorce, migration, close family members' suicide, and retirement were not associated with the risk of PPMS (P &gt; 0.05). History of depression before the PPMS presentation was considerably associated with the incidence of PPMS (P &lt; 0.001). Self-rated health status was scored noticeably lower by cases as compared with controls (P &lt; 0.001). Participants with the paternal educational degree of guidance school showed a higher risk of PPMS by 2.83 time (OR: 2.83; 95% CI (1.02 - 7.80), P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.04) than participants with university educated fathers. In total, SES during adolescence did not indicate any association with the risk of PPMS (with the exception of levels 2 (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02) and 7 (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.05)). No stressful life events were identified as possible increasing risk factors for PPMS. Marriage, close family members' serious disease, and being in debt had a negative association with the disease risk. The history of depression may elevate the risk of PPMS. While the highest and lowest SES levels in adolescence were not remarkable determiners for PPMS, levels 2 and 7 had a positive association with the risk of PPMS. The maternal educational level was not an important factor; however, the paternal educational degree of guidance school as compared to university degree made individuals more susceptible to PPMS.

Experiences of childhood trauma contribute to maternal depression, potentially causing adult socio-economic disparities in mental health. We investigate whether adult socioeconomic status (SES) mediates the relationship between childhood trauma and antenatal depression. We analyzed data from two sociodemographically distinct peri-urban sites in the Western Cape, South Africa in a birth cohort study, the Drakenstein Child Health Study: Mbekweni (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;510) and TC Newman (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;413). Data were collected from pregnant women between 28 and 32 weeks' gestation.

Trauma was differentially associated with SES (Mbekweni: -0.10, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.07; TC Newman: -0.05, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.37) and SES with depression (Mbekweni: -0.18, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01; TC Newman: -0.02, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.62) across both sites. Indirect effects of trauma on depression through SES were 0.018 (95% C.I. -0.002-0.039) in Mbekweni and 0.001 (95% C.I. -0.004-0.006) in TC Newman, suggesting mediation was not supported.

Twin studies can address this issue by implicitly controlling for childhood SES and unmeasured confounders. This co-twin control study used cross-sectional data from Twins Research Australia's Health and Lifestyle Questionnaire (N = 1918 twin pairs). We investigated whether adult SES, as measured by both the Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage (IRSD) and the Australian Socioeconomic Index 2006 (AUSEI06), was associated with BMI after controlling for factors shared by twins within a pair. The primary analysis was a linear mixed-effects model that estimated effects both within and between pairs. Between pairs, a 10-unit increase in AUSEI06 was associated with a 0.29 kg/m2 decrease in BMI (95% CI [-.42, -.17], p &lt; .001), and a 1-decile increase in IRSD was associated with a 0.26 kg/m2 decrease in BMI (95% CI [-.35, -.17], p &lt; .001). No association was observed within pairs. In conclusion, higher adult SES was associated with lower BMI between pairs, but no association was observed within pairs.

Pregnant youth were randomized to intervention (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;40) or care-as-usual (CAU, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;40) from the first trimester of pregnancy until infants were aged 24 months. Mother-infant attachment was coded during a mother-infant interaction when the infants were aged 12 months. Electrophysiological correlates of social processing (mean amplitude of the Nc component) were measured while infants viewed facial images of the mother and a stranger at age 6 months. Infants in the intervention group were more securely attached and more involved with their mothers than those receiving CAU at 12 months.

The potential adverse effects of low SES on children's emotional development are thought to result from proximal factors such as stress. The underlying neurobiological mechanisms, however, remain elusive. The effect of SES on children's integrative cortisol secretion and its modulations on emotion-related brain systems and connectivity were examined in children aged 6 to 12 years. In study 1, we investigated the relationship between SES and cortisol secretion in 239 children. In study 2, using resting-state and task-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging in a subsample of 50 children, we investigated how SES affects children's amygdala-prefrontal functional organization through cortisol secretion. Children from lower SES exhibited lower cortisol secretion, considering basal cortisol, nocturnal cortisol activity during sleep, and cortisol awakening response, which mediated higher amygdala nuclei intrinsic functional connectivity with the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). Critically, these children also exhibited higher task-evoked ventromedial PFC activity through higher intrinsic connectivity of the centromedial amygdala with the medial PFC. They also exhibited higher functional coupling of the centromedial amygdala with the dorsolateral PFC when processing negative emotions. This study demonstrates that SES shapes children's amygdala-prefrontal circuitry through stress-sensitive cortisol secretion, with the most prominent effect in the centromedial amygdala's functional coordination with the ventromedial and dorsolateral PFC involved in processing negative emotions.

The study was performed within the EPICOVID19 web-based Italian survey, involving adults from April-June 2020. Out of 207,341 respondents, 95.9% completed the questionnaire (60% women with an average age of 47.3 vs. 48.9 years among men). The association between fear and demographic and SES characteristics, contacts with COVID-19 cases, nasopharyngeal swab, self-perceived health, flu vaccination, chronic diseases and specific symptoms was analyzed by logistic regression model; odds ratios adjusted for sex, age, education and occupation were calculated (aORs). Fear for FMs prevailed over fear for oneself and was higher among women than men. Fear for oneself decreased with higher levels of education and in those who perceived good health. Among those vaccinated for the flu, 40.8% responded they had feelings of fear for themselves vs. 34.2% of the not vaccinated. Fear increased when diseases were declared and it was higher when associated with symptoms such as chest pain, olfactory/taste disorders, heart palpitations (aORs &gt; 1.5), lung or kidney diseases, hypertension, depression and/or anxiety. Trends in fear by region showed the highest percentage of positive responses in the southern regions.

Using the casefiles of 376 school children registered in a Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) project in the Northwest governorate of Idleb in Syria, this study aimed to determine (i) the rates of various protection concerns (potential mental health conditions, psychosocial deprivation issues, and social, behavioural and emotional issues) for students enrolled in this project, (ii) whether the rates of any of the protection concerns varied between children and adolescents, or between boys and girls, and (iii) which of the identified demographic and protection sector factors predicted the presence of potential mental health conditions and MHPSS intervention outcomes. MHPSS interventions (including individual MHPSS sessions tailored for children in conflict, resilience building activities, tutoring, peer building activities, community awareness, and other tailored services) were implemented at schools operated by the UK-based organization, Syria Relief. The variables tested included demographic variables of age group (208 children, aged 4-9&#x2009;years; 168 adolescents, aged 10-14&#x2009;years) and gender (211 males, 165 females), and 23 protection sector variables including 11 potential mental health problems (anxiety, attention&#xa0;deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, autism, epilepsy, motor tics, depression, post-traumatic-stress disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, learning disability), 7 psychosocial deprivation (PSD) variables (war injury, child labour, loss of caregiver, neglect, domestic abuse, displacement, poverty), and 5 social, behavioural and emotional (SBE) variables (low/abnormal socialization, emotional issue, peer issues/being bullied, peer issues/being aggressive, educational decline). Within the sample, 73.7% were found with a probable mental health problem, with 30.6% showing signs of anxiety, 36.2% of depression and 26.6% showing signs of post-traumatic-stress disorder. Additionally, 74.5% of the sample had at least one form of PSD present (42.6% were displaced, 39.6% suffered from abject poverty), and 64.9% had a reported SBE concern. Children were more likely to have a potential mental health concern, especially autism and PTSD, and poor socialization; while adolescents were more likely to engage in child labour, experience abject poverty, exhibit aggressive behaviour, and educational decline. Male gender was associated with child labour and aggressive behaviour while female gender was associated with the presence of potential mental health problems, especially depression, and loss of caregiver, and poor socialisation. Odds ratios (ORs) indicated significant negative impact of the presence of SBE concerns (any), 4.45 (95% CI: 1.68-12.7), emotional issue, 11.02 (95% CI: 2.76-74.49), low/abnormal socialization, 8.37 (95% CI, 2-57.71), and displacement, 2.91 (95% CI, 1.21-7.48) on the child's mental health. MHPSS intervention outcomes were categorized as case improvement, decline, or incomplete/limited information available; with case improvement noted for 63.6% of the sample, decline noted for 14.4%, and incomplete treatment/limited follow-up noted for 22.1% of the sample. Additional analysis of predictors of treatment success found that child labour was significantly associated with a lack of treatment success, OR 0.24 (95% CI, 0.07-0.92).

In the current paper, we use an epidemiological perspective and highlight the role stress plays on individuals by reviewing the outcomes of major stressors such as poverty and unemployment. We further analyzed the psychological and physical cost of these stressors and their long-term impact. We examined the role of universal basic income and closely looked at income experiments that were implemented in the past, in terms of their effectiveness in enhancing the community as well as individual outcomes and propose the UBI as a tool for alleviating the impact of these stressors.

Social participation has a role in protecting against negative health consequences, yet its association with multimorbidity is unclear, particularly in LMICs. Thus, this study investigated the relationship between physical multimorbidity and social participation among older adults across 6 LMICs. Cross-sectional, community-based data including adults aged 65 years and older from 6 LMICs were analyzed from the WHO Study on Global AGEing and adult health survey. The association between 11 individual chronic conditions or the number of chronic conditions (independent variable) and social participation (range 0-10 with higher scores indicating greater social participation; dependent variable) was assessed by multivariable linear regression analysis. 14,585 individuals (mean age 72.6 [SD 11.5] years; 54.9% females) were included. Among individual conditions, hearing problems, visual impairment, and stroke were significantly associated with lower levels of social participation. Overall, an increasing number of chronic conditions was dose-dependently associated with lower levels of social participation (e.g., &#x2265;4 vs 0 conditions: &#x3b2; = -0.26 [95% CI = -0.39, -0.13]). The association was more pronounced among males than females. Older people with multimorbidity had lower levels of social participation in LMICs.

Premature mortality from other causes and under-representation of deprived individuals in research may lead to this effect being overlooked. We assessed the relationship between deprivation and dementia mortality using comprehensive death certificate data for England and Wales from 2001 to 2017. We used standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and a Poisson model to compare likelihood of dying from dementia in each deprivation decile. We also examined the associations of deprivation with age at death from dementia, and with likelihood of receiving a diagnosis of unspecified dementia. Risk of dying from dementia was higher in more deprived deciles (Mean SMR [95% CI] in decile 1&#x200a;:&#x200a;0.528 [0.506 to 0.550], decile 10:0.369 [0.338 to 0.400]). In 2017, 14,837 excess dementia deaths were attributable to deprivation (21.5% of all dementia deaths that year). There were dose-response associations of deprivation with likelihood of being older at death with dementia (odds ratio [95% CI] for decile 10 (least deprived): 1.31 [1.28 to 1.33] relative to decile 1), and with likelihood of receiving a diagnosis of unspecified dementia (odds ratio [95% CI] for decile 10:0.78 [0.76 to 0.80] relative to decile 1).

This scenario places unprecedented clinical, social, and economic burden upon patients, families, and health systems. The challenges prove particularly pressing for conditions with highly specific diagnostic and management demands, such as frontotemporal dementia. Here we introduce a research and networking initiative designed to tackle these ensuing hurdles, the Multi-partner consortium to expand dementia research in Latin America (ReDLat). First, we present ReDLat's regional research framework, aimed at identifying the unique genetic, social, and economic factors driving the presentation of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease in Latin America relative to the US. We describe ongoing ReDLat studies in various fields and ongoing research extensions. Then, we introduce actions coordinated by ReDLat and the Latin America and Caribbean Consortium on Dementia (LAC-CD) to develop culturally appropriate diagnostic tools, regional visibility and capacity building, diplomatic coordination in local priority areas, and a knowledge-to-action framework toward a regional action plan.

A common critique within the bilingualism literature is the absence of socioeconomic indicators and/or a lack of socioeconomic diversity among participants. Previous research has demonstrated robust bilingual differences in memory generalization from 6- to 24-months of age. The goal of the current study was to examine if these findings would replicate in a sample of 18-month-old monolingual and bilingual infants from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds (N = 92). Results indicate no differences between language groups on working memory or cued recall, but significant differences for memory generalization, with bilingual infants outperforming monolingual infants regardless of socioeconomic status (SES). These findings replicate and extend results from past studies (Brito &amp; Barr, 2012; Brito, Sebasti&#xe1;n-Gall&#xe9;s, &amp; Barr, 2015) and suggest possible differential learning patterns dependent on linguistic experience.",2021,3,1,"Bilingualism (Cambridge, England)","10.1017/s1366728920000334","PMC7995805","Biling (Camb Engl)","eng",NA,NA,"K99 HD086255; R00 HD086255","10.3758/s13428-017-0960-0; 10.3758/s13428-015-0634-8; 10.1044/2015_JSLHR-L-14-0014; 10.1177/0142723716649273; 10.1177/0956797613488145",NA,"Department of Biobehavioral Sciences, Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027."
"33776493","Social Support and Academic Burnout Among University Students: A Moderated Mediation Model.","Yuqiao Ye, Xiuyu Huang, Yang Liu","An increasing number of studies have been carried out to investigate the relationship between social support and study motivation among university students, but underlying mechanisms behind this pathway have not been fully verified. In the present study, we aimed to test the effect of social support on academic burnout (decrease in study motivation); examine the mediating effect of life satisfaction on the association between social support and academic burnout; and explore whether this mediating effect varied across (moderated mediation) students of different socioeconomic status (SES). Data for 503 students were collected in a Chinese university through a composited survey regarding social support, life satisfaction, SES, and academic burnout. Data analysis and the investigation of combined effects in the model were carried out via conditional process modeling. Results indicated that social support was negatively associated with academic burnout. In addition, life satisfaction had a partial mediation effect on the relationship between social support and academic burnout, and SES moderated this mediation effect. Specifically, the mediation effect was found to be more significant among students in the high SES group than those in the lower one. This study is novel in that it establishes empirically how academic burnout is associated with a typical society analytical variable (ie, social support) among students in tertiary education. It also investigates an alternative scenario to explain the underlying mechanism of social support on academic burnout against the most popular explaining model. Implications of the study for effective elimination of the decrease in study motivation across students with different SES are discussed.",2021,1,1,"Psychology research and behavior management","10.2147/PRBM.S300797","PMC7987309","Psychol Res Behav Manag","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1002/smi.2771; 10.2466/pms.1996.83.1.21; 10.1353/csd.2003.0028; 10.1023/A:1015630930326; 10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.12.328; 10.3390/ijerph14060560; 10.1371/journal.pone.0087152; 10.1016/j.paid.2015.10.010; 10.1111/jpm.12216; 10.1177/0893318913509283; 10.1016/j.tate.2017.10.001; 10.1177/0018726712440471; 10.1300/j083v48n03_01; 10.1177/1538192713498899; 10.1080/0309877032000128073; 10.2991/icmesd-19.2019.80; 10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.09.077; 10.1007/s11482-014-9360-0; 10.1097/00004583-199612000-00018; 10.1037/0003-066X; 10.1007/s11205-010-9662-z; 10.1037/0033-2909.131.6.803; 10.1037/1089-2680.9.2.111; 10.1037/0003-066x.56.3.218; 10.1080/0309877X.2017.1323189; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2013.01.001; 10.1037/0033-2909.98.2.310; 10.1002/14651858.CD006358.pub2; 10.1111/aphw.12090; 10.1037/0022-3514.85.6.1136; 10.1016/0030-5073(76)90038-6; 10.1016/j.jpubeco.2010.09.015; 10.1080/00273170701341316; 10.1037/h0057123; 10.1016/j.apnr.2015.03.006; 10.1371/journal.pone.0224322; 10.1080/13548506.2020.1761987; 10.1207/s15327752jpa4901_13; 10.1016/j.paid.2012.07.032; 10.1177/0011000008315975; 10.1007/s11205-011-9930-6; 10.1016/j.nedt.2019.03.004; 10.1037/a0022403; 10.1037/a0021082; 10.1111/j.1475-4991.2007.00219.x; 10.3758/brm.40.3.879; 10.1080/01443410.2018.1545996; 10.1007/s12564-012-9218-9; 10.1080/14783363.2013.807677; 10.1037/cou0000161; 10.1509/jmkr.45.3.261; 10.1016/j.lindif.2017.11.016; 10.1080/13548506.2019.1709651","The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.","Department of Physical Education, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."

The battery of treatments designed to counteract the clinical manifestations of this disease are various and range from a wide spectrum of antiseizure medicationand specific diets, to surgical techniques for resection of the epileptogenic focus. The aim of our study was to describe the State of the art of Epilepsy Surgery (ES) in Africa and examine ways to deal with the high surgical treatment gap. In an observational study, we prospectively disseminated questionnaires via email or directly administered to main epileptologists and neurologists involved in epilepsy care, in key African countries. We also conducted a literature search using PubMed, Google scholar on ES in all the African countries. We received responses from the majority of African countries, which allowed us to identify 3 levels of care for ES in African countries, a first level that uses ES with invasive presurgical evaluation, a second level that uses ES but without invasive presurgical evaluation, and a third level that does not use ES, and we summarized these results on a map. This paper studied the availability of ES as a treatment modality in several African countries.

This study developed and tested the effects of a novel, evidence-based, brief smoking intervention culturally targeted for disadvantaged Black smokers (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04460417). <b><i>Method:</i></b> In this randomized controlled trial, primarily low-income Black non-treatment-seeking smokers (<i>N</i> = 204, 51% female) were randomized to enhanced care (EC) or treatment as usual (TAU). The EC group received a 30-min session with personal feedback on smoking, education on health outcomes and tobacco advertising targeting Black smokers, and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) starter kits. TAU included provision of self-help materials. Primary outcome was motivation to change smoking behavior, and secondary outcomes included NRT knowledge and use, quit attempts, and number of cigarettes smoked per day. Data were collected at baseline, 1- and 6-month follow-ups. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Compared with TAU, EC increased motivation to change (<i>p</i> = .02), accuracy in NRT knowledge, (<i>p</i> &lt; .001), NRT use (<i>p</i> = .01), and likelihood of making a serious quit attempt as well as reduced cigarettes smoked per day (<i>p</i> &lt; .01) through 6-month follow-up. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> A brief motivational intervention for Black non-treatment-seeking smokers increased motivation to change smoking and resulted in improvements in NRT knowledge, use, and quit-relevant behaviors. Findings support cultural-targeting and provision of NRT to enhance motivation in Black smokers to reduce cultural and institutional barriers to tobacco cessation.

Our objective was to quantify white matter metabolite levels and evaluate their relationship with neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 3 years. Our study evaluated a longitudinal prospective cohort of very premature infants (&lt;32 weeks gestational age) with single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy from the centrum semiovale performed at term-equivalent age and standardized cognitive, verbal, and motor assessments at 3 years corrected age. We separately examined metabolite ratios in the left and right centrum semiovale. We also conducted an exploratory interaction analysis for high/low socioeconomic status (SES) to evaluate the relationship between metabolites and neurodevelopmental outcomes, after adjusting for confounders. We found significant relationships between choline/creatine levels in the left and right centrum semiovale and motor development scores. Exploratory interaction analyses revealed that, for infants with low SES, there was a negative association between choline/creatine in the left centrum semiovale and motor assessment scores at age 3 years. Brain metabolites from the centrum semiovale at term-equivalent age were associated with motor outcomes for very preterm infants at 3 years corrected age. This effect may be most pronounced for infants with low SES. Motor development at 3 years corrected age for very preterm infants is inversely associated with choline neurochemistry within the centrum semiovale on magnetic resonance spectroscopy at term-equivalent age, especially in infants with low socioeconomic status. No prior studies have studied metabolites in the centrum semiovale to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes at 3 years corrected age based on high/low socioeconomic status. For very preterm infants with lower socioeconomic status, higher choline-to-creatine ratio in central white matter is associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcomes.",2022,7,1,"Pediatric research","10.1038/s41390-021-01434-5","PMC8410891","Pediatr Res","eng","D001921; D002675; D002794; D003401; D005260; D005317; D006801; D007223; D007231; D007234; D007235; D009682; D011446","Brain; Child, Preschool; Choline; Creatine; Female; Fetal Growth Retardation; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Infant, Premature, Diseases; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Prospective Studies","R01 NS094200; R01 ES026446; R21 HD094085; R01 ES027224; R01 NS096037; T32 ES010957","NA","<b>Disclosure Statement:</b> None of the authors have any conflicts of interest to disclose.","Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."
"33649531","Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome in low-income and middle-income countries: challenges and prospects.","Nowshin Papri, Zhahirul Islam, Sonja E Leonhard, Quazi D Mohammad, Hubert P Endtz, Bart C Jacobs","The epidemiology, clinical characteristics, management and outcome of Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome (GBS) differ between low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) and high-income countries (HIC). At present, limited data are available on GBS in LMIC and the true incidence of GBS in many LMIC remains unknown. Increased understanding of GBS in LMIC is needed because poor hygiene and high exposure to infections render populations in LMIC vulnerable to GBS outbreaks. Furthermore, insufficient diagnostic and health-care facilities in LMIC contribute to delayed diagnosis in patients with severe presentations of GBS. In addition, the lack of national clinical guidelines and absence of affordable, effective treatments contribute to worse outcomes and higher mortality in LMIC than HIC. Systematic population-based surveillance studies, cohort and case-control studies are required to understand the incidence and risk factors for GBS. Novel, targeted and cost-effective treatment strategies need to be developed in the context of health system challenges in LMIC. To ensure integrative rehabilitation services in LMIC, existing prognostic models must be validated, and responsive outcome measures that are cross-culturally applicable must be developed. Therefore, fundamental and applied research to improve the clinical management of GBS in LMIC should become a critical focus of future research programmes.",2021,5,1,"Nature reviews.

This is particularly true for marginalized groups, presenting a fundamental challenge to decreasing racial, economic, and gender-based health disparities. Physical and social environments influence genome function, including the transcriptional activity of core stress responsive genes. We studied the relationship between social experiences that are associated with systemic inequality (e.g., racial segregation, poverty, and neighborhood violence) and blood cell (leukocytes) gene expression, focusing on the activation of transcription factors (TF) critical to stress response pathways. The study used data from 68 women collected from a convenience sample in 2013 from the Southside of Chicago. Comparing single, low-income Black mothers living in neighborhoods with high levels of violence (self-reported and assessed using administrative police records) to those with low levels of violence we found no significant differences in expression of 51 genes associated with the Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity (CTRA). Using TELiS analysis of promoter TF-binding motif prevalence we found that mothers who self-reported higher levels of neighborhood stress showed greater expression of genes regulated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). These findings may reflect increased cortisol output from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, or increased GR transcriptional sensitivity. Transcript origin analyses identified monocytes and dendritic cells as the primary cellular sources of gene transcripts up-regulated in association with neighborhood stress. The prominence of GR-related transcripts and the absence of sympathetic nervous system-related CTRA transcripts suggest that a subjective perception of elevated chronic neighborhood stress may be associated with an HPA-related defeat-withdrawal phenotype rather than a fight-or-flight phenotype. The defeat-withdrawal phenotype has been previously observed in animal models of severe, overwhelming threat. These results demonstrate the importance of studying biological embedding in diverse environments and communities, specifically marginalized populations such as low-income Black women.",2021,5,1,"Psychoneuroendocrinology","10.1016/j.psyneuen.2021.105174","PMC9191231","Psychoneuroendocrinology","eng","D001741; D005260; D006801; D012111; D059467; D014754","Black or African American; Female; Humans; Residence Characteristics; Transcriptome; Violence","K01 HL149989; P30 AG017265","NA","Declarations of interest.

"33633551","Harnessing Neuroimaging to Reduce Socioeconomic Disparities in Chronic Disease: A Conceptual Framework for Improving Health Messaging.","Samantha N Brosso, Paschal Sheeran, Allison J Lazard, Keely A Muscatell","Socioeconomic status (SES)-related health disparities persist for numerous chronic diseases, with lower-SES individuals exhibiting greater risk of morbidity and mortality compared to their higher-SES counterparts. One likely contributor is disparities in health messaging efforts, which are currently less effective for motivating health behavior change among those lower in SES. Drawing on communication neuroscience and social neuroscience research, we describe a conceptual framework to improve health messaging effectiveness in lower SES communities. The framework is based on evidence that health-message-induced activity in the ventral striatum (VS) and subdivisions of the medial pre-frontal cortex (MPFC) predicts behavior change. Additionally, we draw from social neuroscience work showing that activity in these regions during valuation and the processing of self-related vs. social information, differs as a function of SES. Bringing together these previously disparate lines of work, we argue that health messages emphasizing the <i>benefits to close others</i> (vs. the self) of engaging in behavior change will be more effective among lower SES individuals. We also outline a research agenda based on our framework. Ultimately, we hope that this framework utilizing a ""brain-as-predictor"" approach generates novel insights about the neural underpinnings of message-induced behavior change among lower SES individuals, and helps to close the gap in SES-based health disparities by harnessing the power of neuroimaging.",2021,1,1,"Frontiers in human neuroscience","10.3389/fnhum.2021.576749","PMC7901919","Front Hum Neurosci","eng",NA,NA,"P2C HD050924","10.1037/0003-066X.49.1.15; 10.1037/0278-6133.19.6.586; 10.1377/hlthaff.21.2.60; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.0346; 10.3390/healthcare7010017; 10.1177/0956797617695073; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.02.063; 10.1177/0963721412469394; 10.2307/1389785; 10.1001/jama.294.22.2879; 10.1093/scan/nsr036; 10.1002/cncr.23567; 10.1016/j.copsyc.2017.08.031; 10.1509/jmr.13.0611; 10.1007/s40167-016-0046-3; 10.1002/hbm.20707; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2575-09.2009; 10.1038/nn.2761; 10.1038/nrcardio.2009.163; 10.1007/s10552-008-9256-0; 10.1037/0278-6133.27.2.268; 10.1038/srep43250; 10.1027/1864-1105/a000146; 10.1177/0265407509106716; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.04.028; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.03.038; 10.1111/spc3.12500; 10.1093/aje/155.6.516; 10.14485/HBPR.6.4.6; 10.2307/2676296; 10.1016/S0022-3999(02)00303-3; 10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011821; 10.1177/0956797611434964; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0063-10.2010; 10.1037/a0022259; 10.1073/pnas.1500247112; 10.1093/scan/nsv108; 10.1371/journal.pone.0191994; 10.1016/j.neuron.2006.05.001; 10.1111/nyas.13868; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.05.062; 10.1146/annurev-psych-071112-054629; 10.1177/0022022192233006; 10.1023/A:1022157914906; 10.1177/0956797613492773; 10.1093/scan/nsv076; 10.1037/0278-6133.14.3.247; 10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.925; 10.1177/0956797610387613; 10.1037/a0016357; 10.1037/a0028756; 10.1080/07359680802126327; 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.25.101802.123000; 10.1016/j.ypmed.2004.10.013; 10.1037/0882-7974.1.1.34; 10.1037/0022-3514.74.3.763; 10.1037/0022-3514.34.2.191; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2218-11.2011; 10.1016/j.conb.2012.06.001; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2018.12.021; 10.1093/aje/kwf182; 10.1136/jech-2012-201257; 10.1016/j.cub.2011.03.050; 10.1093/scan/nss103; 10.1093/her/cyg041; 10.1037/0033-295X.98.2.224; 10.1177/1745691610375557; 10.1038/nn.3337; 10.1098/rstb.2008.0318; 10.1111/nyas.13862; 10.1093/scan/nsw025; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.01.080; 10.1097/EDE.0000000000000038; 10.1177/135910539800300202; 10.1016/S0277-9536(02)00073-4; 10.1080/13668803.2010.506026; 10.1037/0022-3514.93.1.131; 10.1037/0033-2909.128.1.3; 10.1037/0022-3514.93.6.1011; 10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102529; 10.1073/pnas.1616453114; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2014.04.016; 10.1016/0277-9536(89)90111-1; 10.1037/a0020092; 10.2307/3097245; 10.1146/annurev.soc.25.1.489; 10.1016/bs.aesp.2018.04.001; 10.1146/annurev.soc.28.110601.141114; 10.1073/pnas.1615259114; 10.2307/2786162; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.02.002; 10.1177/109019819702400308; 10.1001/jama.295.7.784; 10.1016/S0277-9536(02)00131-4; 10.1097/01.psy.0000188434.52941.a0; 10.1037/0022-3514.88.4.703; 10.1177/1948550610378757; 10.1037/a0029028; 10.1037/0022-3514.93.5.814; 10.1001/jama.2010.297; 10.1037/bul0000258; 10.1207/S15327957PSPR0601_3; 10.1111/j.1559-1816.2007.00283.x; 10.1080/08870446.2013.843683; 10.1080/08870440902759156; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.11.055; 10.1007/s40167-015-0031-2; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.10.042; 10.1093/scan/nsw113; 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00292.x; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3840-12.2013; 10.2307/2094700; 10.1111/j.1741-3737.2009.00626.x; 10.1093/scan/nsv095; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.08.036; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.08.055; 10.1073/pnas.1511477112; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.08.047; 10.1016/j.neuron.2008.01.025","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States."
"33625277","Body Mass Indices of Girls with and without ADHD: Developmental Trajectories from Childhood to Adulthood.","Patricia A Porter, Laura N Henry, Ashley Halkett, Stephen P Hinshaw","We examined the predictive relation between childhood-diagnosed ADHD and trajectories of body mass index (BMI) from childhood to adulthood in an all-female sample, accounting for socioeconomic status (SES), childhood comorbidities (e.g., depression/anxiety), and stimulant usage. Childhood executive functioning (i.e., planning, sustained attention, and response inhibition) was also evaluated as a possible predictor of BMI trajectories. We utilized longitudinal data from a full sample of 140 girls diagnosed with ADHD in childhood and 88 comparison girls matched on age and ethnicity. Girls were 6-12&#xa0;years old at the first assessment and followed prospectively for 16&#xa0;years. Data were collected on their BMI and stimulant medication usage across four evaluation waves. Using latent growth curve modeling, we evaluated the BMI trajectories of girls with ADHD and the comparison sample from childhood to adulthood. Although there was no significant difference in initial childhood BMI, girls with ADHD increased in BMI at a significantly faster rate than comparison girls across development, even when adjusting for covariates. Significant differences in BMI first emerged in adolescence; by adulthood, 40.2% of the ADHD sample met criteria for obesity versus 15.4% of the comparison sample. When covarying ADHD diagnosis, executive functioning measures were not significantly predictive of BMI increase. Adjusting for stimulant medication usage within the ADHD sample did not alter core findings. We discuss health-related implications for girls with ADHD, potential underlying mechanisms, and how our findings may inform both ADHD and obesity interventions.",2022,1,1,"Journal of clinical child and adolescent psychology : the official journal for the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, American Psychological Association, Division 53","10.1080/15374416.2020.1852942","PMC8842986","J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol","eng","D000293; D000328; D001289; D015992; D000697; D002648; D056344; D005260; D006801; D008137; D009765; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Body Mass Index; Central Nervous System Stimulants; Child; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Obesity; Young Adult","R01 MH045064","10.1038/oby.2009.1; 10.1186/1471-244X-2-9; 10.1017/S0033291716000866; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.08.056; 10.1097/DBP.0b013e3180327917; 10.1542/peds.111.5.1010; 10.1111/desc.12860; 10.1038/s41366-020-0632-5; 10.1017/S1355617706060310; 10.1016/j.mayocp.2015.09.017; 10.3390/brainsci9100256; 10.1542/peds.2012-0540; 10.1007/7854_2011_154; 10.1038/s41366-018-0236-5; 10.1207/S15328007SEM0803_5; 10.1001/archpsyc.1997.01830210105014; 10.1076/chin.6.3.235.3152; 10.1542/peds.110.3.497; 10.1080/15374416.2019.1602840; 10.1016/j.comppsych.2006.05.001; 10.1016/j.jaac.2016.07.774; 10.1037/0022-006X.70.5.1086; 10.1037/0022-006X.70.5.1099; 10.1037/a0029451; 10.1080/10705519909540118; 10.1016/j.jaac.2014.01.009; 10.1177/0049124112442138; 10.1017/S1368980008003728; 10.1038/s41366-019-0346-8; 10.1093/epirev/mxm001; 10.1080/09297049.2018.1508563; 10.1037/a0027792; 10.1016/j.cpr.2015.11.005; 10.1038/oby.2010.278; 10.1001/jama.2018.5158; 10.1017/S0954579416000675; 10.1076/chin.6.2.101.7059; 10.1542/peds.107.5.1049; 10.2196/jmir.2909; 10.1177/1087054715578272; 10.1038/ijo.2010.155; 10.1076/chin.9.4.237.23514; 10.1542/peds.2013-3427; 10.1097/00004583-200001000-00014; 10.1097/CHI.0b013e3180686d63; 10.1007/s11135-017-0469-8; 10.1007/BF02293865; 10.1038/ijo.2012.78; 10.1016/j.jaac.2013.09.001; 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2015.10.002; 10.1542/peds.2007-1955; 10.1093/aje/kws477; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.11.020",NA,"Department of Psychology, University of California, Berkeley."
"33602567","Neuropathology of the 21st century for the Latin American epilepsy community.","Jose Eduardo Peixoto-Santos, Ingmar Blumcke","Many people with epilepsy remain drug-resistant, despite continuous efforts and advances in research and treatment. It is mandatory to understand the epilepsy's underlying etiology, whether it is structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune or (currently) unknown, as it contains major information about the clinical phenotype, cognitive comorbidities, (new) drug targets and also help to predict postsurgical outcome. A multimodal approach, including digital slides and multichannel immunofluorescence labelling can increase the diagnostic yield of subtle pathologies, while DNA methylation arrays could helps in the diagnosis of difficult-to-classify lesions. Such techniques are not always available, however, in low-income countries. Even without access to expensive molecular techniques, automated analysis scripts and machine learning algorithms can be developed by Latin American researchers to improve our diagnostic yield from routine Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin stained tissue sections. The pathology community of Latin America contributed substantially to our current knowledge of etiologies related to human epilepsies and experimental epilepsy models. To further boost the impact of Latin American research, local centers should adhere to modern, multimodal neuropathology techniques, integrate different levels of knowledge, and strengthen their scientific collaborations. Dedicated teaching courses in Epileptology, such as the Latin American Summer Schools of Epilepsy (LASSE) or International Summer School for Neuropathology and Epilepsy Surgery (INES) addressing young researcher and neurologists, are most successful to promote this endeavor. In this review, we will describe the state of neuropathology at the 21st century and also highlight Latin American researchers' contributions to the current knowledge in neuropathology of epilepsy.",2021,8,1,"Seizure","10.1016/j.seizure.2021.02.003",NA,"Seizure","eng","D004827; D006801; D007843; D000072141; D011203; D012574","Epilepsy; Humans; Latin America; Neurologists; Poverty; Schools",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Neuropathology, University Hospitals Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany."

Evidence from many studies highlights that cognitive processes may be adversely affected by vulnerable contexts. The aim of this study was to determine if living in vulnerable conditions affects childhood cognitive development. To achieve this, we assessed the performance of a sample of 347 Guatemalan children and adolescents aged from 6 to 17 years (<i>M</i> = 10.8, <i>SD</i> = 3) in a series of 10 neuropsychological tasks recently standardized for the pediatric population of this country. Two-fifths of the sample (41.5%) could be considered to have vulnerable backgrounds, coming from families with low-socioeconomic status or having had a high exposure to violence. As expected, results showed lower scores in language and attention for the vulnerable group. However, contrary to expectations, consistent systematic differences were not found in the executive function tasks. Vulnerable children obtained lower scores in cognitive flexibility compared to the non-vulnerable group, but higher scores in inhibition and problem-solving tasks. These results suggest the importance of developing pediatric standards of cognitive performance that take environmental vulnerable conditions into consideration. These findings, one of the first obtained in the Guatemalan population, also provide relevant information for specific educational interventions and public health policies which will enhance vulnerable children and adolescent cognitive development.",2021,1,29,"Children (Basel, Switzerland)","10.3390/children8020090","PMC7912439","Children (Basel)","eng",NA,NA,"0INN007/2017","10.14512/gaia.28.2.13; 10.1007/s11625-019-00675-y; 10.1542/peds.2015-3075; 10.1136/bmj.1.4667.1383; 10.1542/peds.2011-2663; 10.1016/j.acap.2016.01.010; 10.3390/ijerph17207620; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05336.x; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.3139; 10.1177/0956797615572233; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2012.01147.x; 10.1111/desc.12561; 10.14204/ejrep.36.14092; 10.1111/nyas.13369; 10.1016/j.lindif.2009.10.009; 10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.003; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00746.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00807.x; 10.1002/icd.1770; 10.1017/s0954579401003133; 10.1186/s41155-016-0016-x; 10.1016/j.brainres.2006.06.072; 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00554; 10.1080/87565641.2018.1554662; 10.1111/cch.12606; 10.2466/PMS.105.7.1187-1195; 10.15446/rsap.v19n3.65597; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00600.x; 10.1016/j.jcomdis.2005.02.003; 10.1016/j.ssmph.2017.08.008; 10.1037/0012-1649.43.5.1062; 10.1111/desc.12019; 10.1111/j.1460-6984.2011.00104.x; 10.1016/j.intell.2014.10.002; 10.1371/journal.pone.0202964; 10.1080/00221325.2011.602374; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2005.00394.x; 10.1111/desc.12917; 10.1177/0165025415603489; 10.1080/15248372.2013.797906; 10.1016/j.dcn.2016.11.006; 10.1111/ajop.12021; 10.2105/AJPH.67.3.233; 10.2105/AJPH.70.12.1277; 10.1177/1524838000001004002; 10.3389/fnbeh.2019.00156; 10.1111/desc.12799; 10.3233/NRE-172275; 10.3233/NRE-172241; 10.3233/NRE-172249; 10.3233/NRE-172243; 10.3233/NRE-172248; 10.3233/NRE-172239; 10.3233/NRE-172244; 10.3233/NRE-172240; 10.3233/NRE-172247; 10.3233/NRE-172242; 10.3233/NRE-172246; 10.2466/pms.1991.72.3.847; 10.1093/geronb/gby071; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.002; 10.1016/j.jecp.2019.04.006; 10.1111/desc.12844; 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00254; 10.2989/17280583.2017.1372285; 10.1002/wcs.1393; 10.1017/S1366728908003477; 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01442; 10.1080/17549507.2018.1444091; 10.1111/desc.12246; 10.1111/cdev.13032; 10.1016/j.jecp.2014.06.007; 10.1177/0956797612443836; 10.1016/j.cognition.2013.11.015; 10.1111/desc.12502; 10.1111/desc.12347; 10.1177/1352458518808204; 10.1017/S135561770410307X; 10.1016/S0010-9452(78)80006-9; 10.1093/arclin/acr018; 10.1044/2015_JSLHR-L-13-0030; 10.1076/1380-3395(200008)22:4;1-0;FT518; 10.1007/BF01997792; 10.1017/S0954579400006027; 10.11144/Javeriana.upsy15-2.ppst","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","Department of Psychology, Human Neuroscience Lab, Universidad Loyola Andaluc&#xed;a, 41704 Sevilla, Spain."

The aim of this meta-analysis is to provide quantitative measures on short-term rates of gastrointestinal SEs in MDD patients treated with second-generation antidepressants. An electronic search of the literature was conducted by using MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science - Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Library databases. Eligible studies had to focus on the use of at least one of 15 antidepressants commonly used in MDD (i.e., agomelatine, bupropion, citalopram, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, levomilnacipran, mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine) and report data on treatment-emergent gastrointestinal SEs (i.e. nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, anorexia, increased appetite and dry mouth) within 12&#xa0;weeks of treatment. Overall, 304 studies were included in the meta-analyses. All the considered antidepressants showed higher rates of gastrointestinal SEs than placebo. Escitalopram and sertraline were shown to be the least tolerated antidepressants on the gastrointestinal tract, being associated with all the considered SEs with the exception of constipation and increased appetite, while mirtazapine was shown to be the antidepressant with fewer side effects on the gut, being only associated with increased appetite. In conclusion, commonly used antidepressants showed different profiles of gastrointestinal SEs, possibly related to their mechanisms of action. The specific tolerability profile of each compound should be considered by clinicians when prescribing antidepressants in order to improve adherence to treatment and increase positive outcomes in patients with MDD.",2021,7,13,"Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology &amp; biological psychiatry","10.1016/j.pnpbp.2021.110266",NA,"Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry","eng","D000928; D003248; D003865; D003967; D006801; D009325; D014839","Antidepressive Agents; Constipation; Depressive Disorder, Major; Diarrhea; Humans; Nausea; Vomiting",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy."

In particular, cash transfer programmes are currently being adapted or expanded in various low-income and middle-income countries to support individuals and families during the pandemic. We argue that the current crisis offers an opportunity for these programmes to focus on susceptible young people (aged 15-24 years), including those with mental health conditions. Young people living in poverty and with mental health problems are at particular risk of experiencing adverse health, wellbeing, and employment outcomes with long-term consequences. They are also at risk of developing mental health conditions during this pandemic. To support this population, cash transfer programmes should not only address urgent needs around food security and survival but expand their focus to address longer-term mental health impacts of pandemics and economic crises. Such an approach could help support young people's future life chances and break the vicious cycle between mental illness and poverty that spirals many young people into both socioeconomic and mental health disadvantage.",2021,4,1,"The lancet.

"33539127","An examination of genetic and environmental factors related to negative personality traits, educational attainment, and economic success.","Michael C Stallings, Tricia Neppl","Personality variables are associated with educational attainment and socioeconomic outcomes. In this study we incorporated a polygenic score derived from the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of educational attainment to date (Lee et al., 2018) into the Interactionist Model of R. D. Conger, Martin, and Masarik (2021) that describes the influence of socioeconomic factors on individual development. The inclusion of a polygenic score predictive of educational attainment (PS-Edu) into this model, and the use of the multigeneration, longitudinal Family Transitions Project (FTP) provide a unique opportunity to investigate genetic and environmental influences on the development of negative personality traits and educational and economic outcomes. The FTP is a three-generation sample. This study utilized data from the first generation (G1; mean age 40 at initiation of the FTP) and second generation (G2; assessed at mean ages 18 and 30). Participants are approximately 50% female, 99% of European ancestry, primarily from lower to middle class SES. PS-Edu was significantly correlated with educational attainment in both generations of the FTP, accounting for 4.1 to 6.7% of the variance. Findings confirm that PS-Edu is a complex genetic index that is correlated with all of the socioeconomic constructs in the model. Results suggest potential gene-environment correlation or common genetic influences underlie associations among parenting investments, negative personality traits, and educational attainment. Genetic variance captured by PS-Edu was mediated substantially through G1 parental investments. Although study limitations warrant cautious interpretation, we demonstrate the promise of including polygenic scores in developmental models to better understand genetic and environmental influences on human development.

A multi-center retrospective study assessing perampanel effectiveness and tolerability for PWE who have undergone surgical resection and/or VNS implantation was performed. The primary outcome was &#x2265;50% reduction in seizure frequency while secondary outcomes included side effects (SEs), dose-related effectiveness, and toxicity. The median perampanel dose was 6&#x202f;mg. Only one PWE became seizure free.

As perinatally infected children increasingly survive into adulthood, the quality of life and mental health of this population has increased in importance. This review provides a synthesis of the prevalence of mental health problems in this population and explores associated factors. A systematic database search (Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus) with an additional hand search was conducted. Peer-reviewed studies on adolescents (aged 10-19), published between 2008 and 2019, assessing mental health symptoms or psychiatric disorders, either by standardized questionnaires or by diagnostic interviews, were included. The search identified 1461 articles, of which 301 were eligible for full-text analysis. Fourteen of these, concerning HIV-positive adolescents, met the inclusion criteria and were critically appraised. Mental health problems were highly prevalent among this group, with around 25% scoring positive for any psychiatric disorder and 30-50% showing emotional or behavioral difficulties or significant psychological distress. Associated factors found by regression analysis were older age, not being in school, impaired family functioning, HIV-related stigma and bullying, and poverty. Social support and parental competence were protective factors. Mental health problems among HIV-positive adolescents are highly prevalent and should be addressed as part of regular HIV care.",2020,1,1,"Global mental health (Cambridge, England)","10.1017/gmh.2020.18","PMC7786273","Glob Ment Health (Camb)","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1080/09540121.2011.644233",NA,"Department of Social Work, Faculty of Business and Social Sciences, Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, Germany."
"33487170","Barriers and drivers to service delivery in global mental health projects.","Onaiza Qureshi, Tarik Endale, Grace Ryan, Georgina Miguel-Esponda, Srividya N Iyer, Julian Eaton, Mary De Silva, Jill Murphy","Research in global mental health (GMH) has previously documented how contextual factors like political instability, poverty and poorly-funded health infrastructure continue to compromise effective and equitable mental health service delivery. There is a need to develop more feasible and evidence-based solutions through implementation research. This paper, one in a series pertaining to implementation in GMH projects worldwide, focuses on implementation factors influencing mental health service delivery. This is a qualitative study carried out as part of a Theory of Change-driven evaluation of Grand Challenges Canada's (GCC's) Global Mental Health portfolio. Purposive sampling was used to recruit twenty-nine GCC grantees for interviews. A semi-structured interview schedule was used to guide the interviews which were recorded and subsequently transcribed. Transcripts were double-coded and analyzed in NVivo 11 using framework analysis. This paper reports results related to detection and treatment of mental illness, mental health promotion and prevention of mental illness. Key barriers included: lack of appropriate human resources and expertise for service delivery; lack of culturally appropriate screening tools and interventions; and difficulties integrating services with the existing mental health system. Formative research was a key driver facilitating the cultural adaptation of mental health detection, treatment, promotion and preventative approaches. Recruiting local providers and utilizing mHealth for improving screening, monitoring and data management were also found to be successful approaches in reducing workforce burden, improving sustainability, mental health literacy, participant engagement and uptake. The study identifies a number of key barriers to and drivers of successful service delivery from the perspective of grantees implementing GMH projects. Findings highlight several opportunities to mitigate common challenges, providing recommendations for strengthening systems- and project-level approaches for delivering mental health services. Further, more inclusive research is required to inform guidance around service delivery for successful implementation, better utilization of funding and improving mental health outcomes among vulnerable populations in low-resource settings.",2021,1,24,"International journal of mental health systems","10.1186/s13033-020-00427-x","PMC7827991","Int J Ment Health Syst","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00390-6; 10.1186/s13033-015-0031-9; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61093-3; 10.1017/S2045796017000075; 10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31612-X; 10.1038/475027a; 10.1177/0020764019879943; 10.1017/gmh.2019.9; 10.1186/s13031-020-00290-0; 10.1017/gmh.2014.4; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61239-2; 10.1186/1752-4458-8-15; 10.1177/1525822X05279903; 10.1186/s13033-017-0173-z; 10.4314/ajpsy.v13i2.54357; 10.1186/1471-2458-11-828; 10.1186/s13033-016-0060-z; 10.1007/s40596-015-0437-3; 10.1371/journal.pone.0156939; 10.1093/ije/dyt227; 10.1007/s11013-010-9170-2; 10.1017/gmh.2018.6; 10.2196/jmir.2130; 10.1136/bmj.39513.441030.AD; 10.1111/bjhp.12260; 10.1016/j.brat.2011.06.012; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001448; 10.1016/j.wpsyc.2012.05.009; 10.1186/s12888-018-1763-2; 10.1097/YCO.0000000000000506; 10.1016/j.beth.2016.09.005","The authors have previously received GCC funding, either through the MHIN innovator support platform (GKR, GLE, GME, JE, LL, MDS, OQ, SU, TE) or through a GCC grant for a project included in this dataset (JM, OQ).","Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, 2255 Westbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T 2A1, Canada."

Maternal immune activation (MIA), triggered by both acute and systemic chronic inflammation, is hypothesized to be one of the mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Although there is substantial preclinical evidence to support the MIA hypothesis, the human evidence is disparate. We performed a systematic review on human studies examining associations between maternal inflammatory states and offspring NDDs (autism spectrum disorder- ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-ADHD, Tourette syndrome-TS). 32 meta-analyses and 26 additional individual studies were identified. Maternal states associated with ASD include obesity, gestational diabetes mellitus, pre-eclampsia, pollution, stress, depression, autoimmune diseases, and infection. Maternal states associated with ADHD include obesity, pre-eclampsia, smoking, low socioeconomic status (SES), stress, autoimmune disease, and asthma. Maternal states associated with TS include low SES, depression, and autoimmune diseases. Diverse maternal inflammatory states in pregnancy are associated with common offspring NDDs. Given the increased prevalence of NDDs, there is urgent need to explore relative and cumulative maternal risk factors and disease mechanisms.

This study aims to identify multi-level influences on BSA overuse across diverse high and low income, and public and private, healthcare contexts. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 46 prescribers from hospitals in the UK, Sri Lanka, and South Africa, including public and private providers. Interviews explored decision making about prescribing BSAs, drivers of the use of BSAs, and benefits of BSAs to various stakeholders, and were analyzed using a constant comparative approach. Analysis identified drivers of BSA overuse at the individual, social and structural levels. Structural drivers of overuse varied significantly across contexts and included: system-level factors generating tensions with stewardship goals; limited material resources within hospitals; and patient poverty, lack of infrastructure and resources in local communities. Antimicrobial stewardship needs to encompass efforts to reduce the reliance on BSAs as a solution to context-specific structural conditions.",2021,1,19,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)","10.3390/antibiotics10010094","PMC7835907","Antibiotics (Basel)","eng",NA,NA,"ES/P004784/1","10.1001/archinte.163.8.972; 10.7326/M18-3640; 10.1038/s41598-020-75063-z; 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012974; 10.2165/00003495-199855030-00001; 10.1186/s13756-019-0515-5; 10.1093/jac/dks202; 10.1002/14651858.CD003543.pub4; 10.1057/s41599-019-0263-4; 10.1186/1472-6963-8-123; 10.3389/fsoc.2020.00007; 10.1016/S0277-9536(02)00422-7; 10.1093/jac/dkz233; 10.1371/journal.pone.0209847; 10.1080/16549716.2019.1599560; 10.1136/bmjgh-2019-001590; 10.1111/bioe.12604; 10.1017/ice.2015.136; 10.1186/s13756-016-0159-7; 10.1071/AH14111; 10.1016/j.jhin.2018.08.007; 10.1016/j.cmi.2017.07.010; 10.1093/cid/cit212; 10.2217/fmb-2016-0041; 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2014.11.014; 10.1016/j.cmi.2018.08.020; 10.1177/1049732320919088; 10.1016/j.cmi.2017.03.013; 10.3389/fsoc.2020.00005; 10.1080/09581596.2018.1516032; 10.1089/sur.2019.142; 10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.126; 10.1057/s41285-018-0063-8; 10.1136/bmjqs-2019-009445","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","Department of Neuroscience, Psychology and Behaviour, University of Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK."

Sesamin (Ses), a major lignan of sesame seed and its oil, shows anti-hyperglycemic, anti-oxidative, and neuroprotective effects. The present study was designed to assess the potential protective effects of Ses against DABD and investigate the roles of inflammatory markers and neurotrophic factors in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. After confirmation of diabetes, Ses (30&#xa0;mg/kg/day; P.O.) or insulin (6&#xa0;IU/rat/day; S.C.) was administered to rats for eight consecutive weeks. During the eighth-week period of the study, behavioral functions of the animals were evaluated by employing standard behavioral paradigms. Moreover, inflammation status, neurotrophic factors, and histological changes were assessed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal regions of the rats. The results of behavioral tests showed that STZ-induced diabetes increased anxiety-/depression-like behaviors, decreased locomotor/exploratory activities, and impaired passive avoidance learning and memory. These DABD were accompanied by neuroinflammation, lack of neurotrophic support, and neuronal loss in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the rats. Intriguingly, chronic treatment with Ses improved all the above-mentioned diabetes-related behavioral, biochemical, and histological deficits, and in some cases, it was even more effective than insulin therapy. In conclusion, the results suggest that Ses was capable of improving DABD, which might be ascribed, at least partly, to the reduction of blood glucose level, inhibition of neuroinflammation, and potentiation of neurotrophic factors.",2021,3,1,"International immunopharmacology","10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107356",NA,"Int Immunopharmacol","eng","D000818; D000975; D001007; D002540; D003863; D003921; D004149; D004195; D006624; D007249; D017705; D008297; D018782; D008569; D009414; D018696; D051381","Animals; Antioxidants; Anxiety; Cerebral Cortex; Depression; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Dioxoles; Disease Models, Animal; Hippocampus; Inflammation; Lignans; Male; Maze Learning; Memory Disorders; Nerve Growth Factors; Neuroprotective Agents; Rats",NA,"NA",NA,"Research Center of Oils and Fats, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."

Assess the gFC with regard to amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) biomarkers, and estimated years to symptom onset (EYO). <b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Cross-sectional measures were assessed in MC (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;171) and mutation noncarrier (NC) (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;70) participants. A functional connectivity (FC) matrix that encompassed multiple resting-state networks was computed for each participant. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A global FC was compiled as a single index indicating FC strength. The gFC signature was modeled as a nonlinear function of EYO. The gFC was linearly associated with other biomarkers used for assessing the AT(N) framework, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), positron emission tomography (PET) molecular biomarkers, and structural magnetic resonance imaging. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The gFC was reduced in MC compared with NC participants. When MC participants were differentiated by clinical dementia rating (CDR), the gFC was significantly decreased in MC CDR &gt;0 (demented) compared with either MC CDR 0 (cognitively normal) or NC participants.

"33427182","Cortisol and socioeconomic status in early childhood: A multidimensional assessment.","Amanda R Tarullo, Charu T Tuladhar, Katie Kao, Eleanor B Drury, Jerrold Meyer","The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is sensitive to early life stress, with enduring consequences for biological stress vulnerability and health (Gunnar &amp; Talge, 2008). Low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with dysregulation of the stress hormone cortisol in early childhood. However, a mechanistic understanding of this association is lacking. Multidimensional assessment of both SES and cortisol is needed to characterize the intricate relations between SES and cortisol function in early childhood. We assessed parent-reported family income, parent education, occupational prestige, neighborhood risk, food insecurity, and household chaos for 12-month-old infants (N = 90) and 3.5-year-old children (N = 91). Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) was obtained from parent and child, indexing chronic biological stress, and diurnal salivary cortisol was measured in the children. Controlling for parent HCC, parent education uniquely predicted infant and child HCC and, in addition, neighborhood risk uniquely predicted infant HCC. Household chaos predicted bedtime salivary cortisol concentration (SCC) for both infants and children, and infant daily cortisol output. Food insecurity was associated with flattened cortisol slope in 3.5-year-old children. Parental sensitivity did not mediate relations between SES and cortisol. Results highlight the utility of SES measures that index unpredictable and unsafe contexts, such as neighborhood risk, food insecurity, and household chaos.",2020,12,1,"Development and psychopathology","10.1017/S0954579420001315","PMC7938639","Dev Psychopathol","eng","D002648; D002675; D006801; D006854; D007030; D007223; D010913; D012463; D012923; D013315","Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Infant; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Saliva; Social Class; Stress, Psychological","R03 HD082550","10.1023/A:1025321609994; 10.1017/S0954579411000617; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.06.025; 10.1055/s-0029-1211969; 10.1007/s10964-012-9838-8; 10.1177/0956797609355566; 10.1016/j.infbeh.2014.04.008; 10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.08.019; 10.1016/j.ygcen.2006.01.005; 10.1002/ajhb.22668; 10.1002/dev.21602; 10.1111/1467-8624.00469; 10.1177/0956797612441218; 10.1002/dev.21449; 10.1016/j.sleep.2012.01.018; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.10.022; 10.1177/1745691616680612; 10.1037/a0025519; 10.1080/10253890.2019.1604667; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.05.030; 10.1080/10253890.2017.1391210; 10.1002/dev.21850; 10.1177/0193945919867112; 10.1016/S0006-3223(00)00965-3; 10.1016/0193-3973(95)90028-4; 10.1001/archinte.1993.00410180039004; 10.1210/en.2012-1226; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.10.003; 10.1016/S0306-4530(02)00108-7; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.12.016; 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2009.12.001; 10.1002/smi.2842; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2007.12.001; 10.1016/j.infbeh.2017.03.007; 10.1017/S0954579411000411; 10.1017/S0033291716003068; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.01.020; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2012.06.009; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.11.022; 10.1111/jcpp.12700; 10.1007/s10578-012-0304-3","Conflicts of Interest: None","Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA."
"33427175","How developmental neuroscience can help address the problem of child poverty.","Seth D Pollak, Barbara L Wolfe","Nearly 1 in 5 children in the United States lives in a household whose income is below the official federal poverty line, and more than 40% of children live in poor or near-poor households. Research on the effects of poverty on children's development has been a focus of study for many decades and is now increasing as we accumulate more evidence about the implications of poverty. The American Academy of Pediatrics recently added ""Poverty and Child Health"" to its Agenda for Children to recognize what has now been established as broad and enduring effects of poverty on child development. A recent addition to the field has been the application of neuroscience-based methods. Various techniques including neuroimaging, neuroendocrinology, cognitive psychophysiology, and epigenetics are beginning to document ways in which early experiences of living in poverty affect infant brain development. We discuss whether there are truly worthwhile reasons for adding neuroscience and related biological methods to study child poverty, and how might these perspectives help guide developmentally based and targeted interventions and policies for these children and their families.",2020,12,1,"Development and psychopathology","10.1017/S0954579420001145","PMC8346912","Dev Psychopathol","eng","D002648; D005190; D005191; D006801; D007182; D007223; D011203; D012959; D014481","Child; Family; Family Characteristics; Humans; Income; Infant; Poverty; Socioeconomic Factors; United States","R01 MH061285; U54 HD090256","10.1093/aje/kwq483; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.05.062; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.15081014; 10.1080/00220380008422652; 10.1177/1745691610388779; 10.1177/0963721412469394; 10.1073/pnas.1708791114; 10.1016/j.acap.2016.01.010; 10.1542/peds.2012-2661; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2003.11.002; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2017.08.023; 10.3389/fnins.2014.00276; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.2988; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.07.019; 10.1111/spc3.12304; 10.1257/000282802762024520; 10.1093/qje/qjy007; 10.1257/aer.20150572; 10.1038/npp.2016.198; 10.1186/s12939-017-0670-3; 10.1073/pnas.1703444114; 10.18356/31de68d5-en; 10.1017/S0954579415001169; 10.3389/fnhum.2017.00547; 10.1002/wcs.1176; 10.1257/jep.27.2.109; 10.1016/j.dcn.2017.12.005; 10.1002/dev.21373; 10.1073/pnas.1604756114; 10.1257/pol.6.2.258; 10.1111/cdep.12013; 10.1177/0956797611434964; 10.1002/hbm.22553; 10.1038/s41583-018-0023-2; 10.1162/jocn_a_00750; 10.1111/desc.12450; 10.1111/nyas.13318; 10.1016/j.neuron.2014.10.047; 10.1073/pnas.1307893110; 10.1016/j.conb.2010.02.008; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.11.079; 10.1186/2045-5380-4-12; 10.1073/pnas.1909699116; 10.1038/nrn2897; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.1475; 10.1016/j.acap.2016.11.007; 10.1371/journal.pone.0018712; 10.1371/journal.pone.0080954; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.04.020; 10.1111/jcpp.12694; 10.1111/desc.12596; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.07.034; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.06.061; 10.1080/02724990444000113; 10.1073/pnas.1008950108; 10.1097/YCO.0000000000000178; 10.1016/j.cobeha.2018.01.016; 10.1177/1754073917693085; 10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00154; 10.1016/S2352-4642(17)30024-X; 10.1542/peds.2015-3075; 10.1016/j.bpsc.2016.04.005; 10.1016/j.nlm.2013.09.012; 10.3758/s13423-010-0048-7; 10.1073/pnas.1308240110; 10.1111/jcpp.12784; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e3182a151a7; 10.1111/desc.12096; 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00554; 10.1073/pnas.1518285112; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.3139; 10.1073/pnas.1902286116; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.1813; 10.1177/0956797615572233; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2012.07.012; 10.1146/annurev-vision-082114-035431; 10.1016/j.cognition.2007.07.017; 10.1016/B978-0-12-813146-6.00002-3; 10.1146/annurev-soc-060116-053252; 10.1016/j.neuron.2013.06.028; 10.1093/swr/svy007; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5501-05.2006; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0334-11.2011; 10.1080/15374416.2017.1326122; 10.3758/s13423-013-0391-6; 10.1177/0956797610370161; 10.1056/NEJMsa044316; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.02.025; 10.1002/hipo.22661; 10.1007/s10865-011-9382-0; 10.1016/j.jad.2019.04.088; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.01.080; 10.1038/nn.3983; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2011.06.019; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2018.02.002; 10.1017/S0954579418000123; 10.1016/j.comppsych.2018.12.012; 10.1038/s41598-017-17765-5; 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2017.05.004; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.12.031; 10.1111/desc.12946; 10.1111/cdev.12270; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0484-18.2018; 10.1080/10615806.2017.1330952; 10.1038/nn.4109; 10.1016/j.cognition.2013.08.009; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2011.03.003; 10.1016/j.acap.2015.11.005; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2012.65; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.10.002; 10.1177/1745691620920725; 10.1038/npp.2014.75; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.10.015; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.12.055; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.11.022; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0858-10.2010; 10.1371/journal.pone.0030148; 10.1007/7854_2016_42; 10.1016/j.brainres.2006.08.104; 10.1038/35083500; 10.1016/j.nbd.2011.01.020; 10.1162/jocn.2008.20040; 10.1016/j.bandl.2011.12.011; 10.1177/1745691612469029; 10.1038/oby.2011.168",NA,"Departments of Economics, Population Health Sciences and Public Affairs, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA."

This study examined the impacts of family functioning and genetic risk for schizophrenia on psychiatric morbidity of adoptees in families of high SES (HSES) and low SES (LSES). The study population is a subgroup of the Finnish Adoptive Family Study of Schizophrenia. Of the adoptees, 152 had high genetic risk for schizophrenia spectrum disorders (HR) and 151 adoptees had low risk (LR). Of the adoptees, 185 (HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;94, LR&#x2009;=&#x2009;91) were raised in high-SES (HSES) families and 118 (HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;58, LR&#x2009;=&#x2009;60) in low-SES (LSES) families. The family SES was determined by the occupational status of the main provider of the family. The functioning of adoptive families was assessed based on Global Family Ratings (GFRs) and psychiatric disorders on DSM-III-R criteria. In the HSES families, the psychiatric morbidity of the adoptees was emphasized by HR (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.28, CI 2.14-8.56) and dysfunctional family processes (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;6.44, CI 2.75-15.04). In the LSES families, the adoptees&#xb4; psychiatric morbidity was almost significantly increased by HR (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.10, CI 0.99-4.45), but not by dysfunctional family processes (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.33, CI 0.53-3.34). This study showed that in HSES families, dysfunctional family processes and HR for schizophrenia increased the likelihoods for the development of psychiatric disorders in adoptees. The results can be utilized in identifying risk factors in the development of psychiatric disorders and focusing preventative strategies on risk groups with acknowledging the importance of family functioning.",2022,7,1,"Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology","10.1007/s00127-020-02016-2",NA,"Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol","eng","D000300; D005387; D020022; D006801; D001523; D012307; D012559; D012923","Adoption; Finland; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Mental Disorders; Risk Factors; Schizophrenia; Social Class",NA,"10.1177/1745691616673192; 10.1111/bjso.12251; 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233; 10.1016/j.copsyc.2017.03.001; 10.1001/jama.294.22.2879; 10.1136/jech.2005.041319; 10.1016/j.dr.2018.03.006; 10.1111/j.1741-3737.2010.00725.x; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.0346; 10.1007/s00127-011-0462-9; 10.1177/1066480713476836; 10.1371/journal.pone.0213700; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2006.04.001; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.2299; 10.1016/j.psychres.2007.08.006; 10.1016/S2468-2667(19)30248-8; 10.1093/epirev/mxh001; 10.1037/0033-2909.128.2.330; 10.1176/appi.ajp.162.9.1652; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.09010114; 10.1016/S0920-9964(96)00119-3; 10.1136/bmj.323.7326.1398; 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09674-5; 10.1007/s00127-004-0715-y; 10.1016/j.jaac.2010.05.017; 10.1093/eurpub/ckq083; 10.1093/schbul/sbr047; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.86; 10.1093/schbul/sbt114; 10.1097/YPG.0000000000000240; 10.1034/j.1600-0447.2000.101006433.x; 10.1176/appi.ajp.160.9.1587; 10.1016/j.psychres.2019.06.006; 10.1016/j.psychres.2019.06.017; 10.1192/bjp.184.3.216; 10.1176/ajp.154.3.355; 10.1017/S0033291704002661; 10.1111/j.1545-5300.2006.00180.x; 10.1016/j.cpr.2005.06.011; 10.1007/s10826-013-9793-3; 10.1016/0022-3956(87)90091-4; 10.1093/schbul/13.3.477; 10.1002/(SICI)1096-8628(19960409)67:2&lt;179::AID-AJMG8&gt;3.0.CO;2-N; 10.1080/08039480500227683; 10.1300/J145v08n02_01; 10.1007/s10567-013-0130-6; 10.1097/00004583-200006000-00008; 10.1093/schbul/sbn117; 10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.08.019; 10.1023/A:1023285422736; 10.1192/bjp.187.2.101; 10.1136/bmjpo-2018-000353; 10.1007/s00127-012-0599-1; 10.1037/0893-3200.19.2.294; 10.1007/s00127-005-0950-x; 10.1007/s00127-017-1451-4; 10.1037/0012-1649.40.3.412; 10.1371/journal.pone.0231792; 10.1126/science.1546291; 10.1001/archpsyc.60.5.473",NA,"Department of Psychiatry, Oulu University Hospital, P.O.

"33395612","Early childhood stress is associated with blunted development of ventral tegmental area functional connectivity.","Anne T Park, Ursula A Tooley, Julia A Leonard, Austin L Boroshok, Cassidy L McDermott, M Dylan Tisdall, Allyson P Mackey","Early life stress increases risk for later psychopathology, due in part to changes in dopaminergic brain systems that support reward processing and motivation. Work in animals has shown that early life stress has a profound impact on the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which provides dopamine to regions including nucleus accumbens (NAcc), anterior hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), with cascading effects over the course of development. However, little is known about how early stress exposure shifts the developmental trajectory of mesocorticolimbic circuitry in humans. In the current study, 88 four- to nine-year-old children participated in resting-state fMRI. Parents completed questionnaires on their children's chronic stress exposure, including socioeconomic status (SES) and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). We found an age x SES interaction on VTA connectivity, such that children from higher SES backgrounds showed a positive relationship between age and VTA-mPFC connectivity. Similarly, we found an age x ACEs exposure interaction on VTA connectivity, such that children with no ACEs exposure showed a positive relationship between age and VTA-mPFC connectivity. Our findings suggest that early stress exposure relates to the blunted maturation of VTA connectivity in young children, which may lead to disrupted reward processing later in childhood and beyond.",2021,2,1,"Developmental cognitive neuroscience","10.1016/j.dcn.2020.100909","PMC7785957","Dev Cogn Neurosci","eng","D002648; D002675; D006624; D006801; D009714; D017397; D012201; D017557","Child; Child, Preschool; Hippocampus; Humans; Nucleus Accumbens; Prefrontal Cortex; Reward; Ventral Tegmental Area","R34 DA050297; S10 OD023495; T32 MH017168","10.1037/neu0000476; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.10.010; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.09.025; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0895-11.2011; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.04.042; 10.1016/j.cell.2015.07.015; 10.1093/ijnp/pyx056; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0394-12.2012; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.05.059; 10.1007/s00213-013-3369-1; 10.1016/j.neuron.2019.08.036; 10.1002/neu.20025; 10.1006/nimg.1998.0395; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.01.021; 10.1387/ijdb.092974ms; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.08.025; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.10.015; 10.1073/pnas.1602413113; 10.1037/0003-066X.59.2.77; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.06.022; 10.1017/S0954579417001456; 10.1073/pnas.1208243109; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0598-16.2016; 10.1093/cercor/bhu088; 10.1038/s41380-019-0514-1; 10.3389/fninf.2011.00013; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.04.016; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.01.079; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2009.186; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.06.060; 10.1016/j.tics.2019.10.003; 10.1177/1073858414524442; 10.1016/j.neuron.2014.08.031; 10.1093/scan/nsv124; 10.1017/S0033291717003348; 10.1016/j.cobeha.2015.09.004; 10.1073/pnas.1705643114; 10.1146/annurev-neuro-070815-013952; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116493; 10.1093/cercor/bhv030; 10.1038/nn.4114; 10.1007/s00213-015-4151-3; 10.1016/j.tins.2017.09.004; 10.1038/nrn1684; 10.1016/j.cobeha.2018.01.016; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.09.015; 10.1016/j.bbi.2015.08.007; 10.1038/s41467-020-14693-3; 10.1002/smj.2221; 10.1038/mp.2017.83; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1184-06.2006; 10.1186/s12993-016-0099-7; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181ba18ed; 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02869; 10.1002/hbm.23978; 10.1016/j.bpsc.2016.11.002; 10.1177/0963721416655883; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.2277; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.2537; 10.1073/pnas.1503960112; 10.1111/tsq.12107; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.04.001; 10.1007/978-3-319-31815-8_2; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.06.047; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.07.034; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3508-17.2018; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2018.02.002; 10.1242/dev.027003; 10.1080/08870440310001638098; 10.1016/j.comppsych.2018.12.012; 10.1016/B978-0-12-397025-1.00221-9; 10.1126/science.aan4491; 10.1016/j.neuron.2017.08.002; 10.1371/journal.pone.0136961; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2017.06.009; 10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101920; 10.1109/TMI.2011.2131152; 10.1038/nrn3381; 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.10.021; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116366; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.07.037; 10.1002/hbm.10062; 10.1016/j.conb.2010.01.006; 10.1016/j.bandc.2009.07.003; 10.1016/j.neures.2016.04.008; 10.1089/brain.2014.0299; 10.1002/mrm.23228; 10.1093/cercor/bhs382; 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.03.017; 10.1126/science.aaz5891; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1598-11.2011; 10.1152/jn.00338.2011","The authors report no declarations of interest.","Department of Psychology, School of Arts and Sciences, University of Pennsylvania, United States."

We articulate how combining multilevel ecological models from developmental science and developmental psychopathology with human neuroscience can inform our approach to understanding the developmental neuroscience of risk and resilience. To illustrate this approach, we focus on associations between poverty and brain function, the roles parents and neighborhoods play in this context, and the potential impact of developmental timing. We also describe the major challenges and needed advances in these areas of research to better understand how and why poverty-related adversity may impact the developing brain, including the need for: a population neuroscience approach with greater attention to sampling and representation, genetically informed and causal designs, advances in assessing context and brain function, caution in interpretation of effects, and a focus on resilience. Work in this area has major implications for policy and prevention, which are discussed.

Thus, we aimed to identify trajectories of psychosocial functioning in a FEP cohort followed-up for 2 years in order to find premorbid/baseline predictors for each trajectory. Additionally, we explored diagnosis distribution within the different trajectories. A total of 261 adults with FEP were included. Latent class growth analysis identified four distinct trajectories: Mild impairment-Improving trajectory (Mi-I) (38.31% of the sample), Moderate impairment-Stable trajectory (Mo-S) (18.39%), Severe impairment-Improving trajectory (Se-I) (12.26%), and Severe impairment-Stable trajectory (Se-S) (31.03%). Participants in the Mi-I trajectory were more likely to have higher parental socioeconomic status, less severe baseline depressive and negative symptoms, and better premorbid adjustment than individuals in the Se-S trajectory. Participants in the Se-I trajectory were more likely to have better baseline verbal learning and memory and better premorbid adjustment than those in the Se-S trajectory. Lower baseline positive symptoms predicted a Mo-S trajectory vs. Se-S trajectory. Diagnoses of Bipolar disorder and Other psychoses were more prevalent among individuals falling into Mi-I trajectory. Our findings suggest four distinct trajectories of psychosocial functioning after FEP. We also identified social, clinical, and cognitive factors associated with more resilient trajectories, thus providing insights for early interventions targeting psychosocial functioning.",2020,12,28,"Journal of clinical medicine","10.3390/jcm10010073","PMC7796026","J Clin Med","eng",NA,NA,"CM19/00123","10.1186/1745-0179-3-5; 10.1038/nrdp.2015.67; 10.1001/archpsyc.1981.01780360066006; 10.1017/CBO9780511776922.016; 10.1017/S0033291711001504; 10.1192/S0007125000297663; 10.1016/j.cpr.2017.09.007; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2017.17090972; 10.3390/brainsci10080525; 10.1016/j.rpsm.2019.03.001; 10.1017/S0033291715002305; 10.1016/j.alcr.2019.100323; 10.1192/bjp.bp.114.153486; 10.1016/j.schres.2019.02.003; 10.1016/j.schres.2018.01.021; 10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00580; 10.1016/j.rpsm.2012.11.001; 10.1016/j.rpsm.2018.10.001; 10.4088/JCP.19m12996; 10.1159/000259089; 10.1093/schbul/13.2.261; 10.1016/0165-1781(94)90093-0; 10.1016/S0025-7753(02)73419-2; 10.1192/bjp.133.5.429; 10.1016/S0025-7753(02)72429-9; 10.1192/bjp.134.4.382; 10.1176/ajp.154.11.1544; 10.1111/j.1399-5618.2011.00964.x; 10.1016/j.jad.2018.07.045; 10.1097/NMD.0b013e3181f97bf9; 10.1002/jts.2490030314; 10.1016/S0920-9964(99)00161-9; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07010042; 10.2466/pms.1958.8.3.271; 10.1016/j.schres.2015.02.022; 10.1080/10705511.2016.1247646; 10.1007/BF01246098; 10.18637/jss.v078.i02; 10.1016/j.jad.2018.06.005; 10.1111/acps.12949; 10.4088/JCP.13m08914; 10.1177/0004867417747401; 10.3758/BRM.40.3.879; 10.1086/651257; 10.1016/j.jad.2018.12.108; 10.1176/appi.ajp.162.3.495; 10.1093/schbul/sby115; 10.1016/j.schres.2014.06.023; 10.3390/jcm8071046; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00511.x; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2016.15111419; 10.1093/schbul/sbz033; 10.1016/j.jad.2016.10.012; 10.1017/S0033291720002226; 10.1016/j.schres.2016.03.006; 10.1161/JAHA.118.010616; 10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30057-9; 10.1002/wps.20446; 10.1016/j.schres.2017.03.002; 10.1016/j.jad.2007.12.234; 10.1111/acps.12894; 10.1017/S0033291720001968; 10.1016/j.schres.2010.10.013; 10.1016/j.schres.2016.04.017; 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2020.03.010; 10.1016/S0920-9964(01)00229-8; 10.1093/schbul/sbaa054; 10.1371/journal.pone.0151299; 10.1016/j.schres.2017.08.032; 10.1093/schbul/sbv050; 10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00641; 10.1017/S0033291715001713; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.11091337; 10.1038/s41537-017-0021-9; 10.1016/j.comppsych.2018.07.015; 10.1371/journal.pone.0123707; 10.1017/S0033291719002381; 10.1016/j.bpsc.2020.03.011; 10.1093/schbul/sbq059; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.12010109; 10.3390/jcm8050586","I.G. has received grants and served as consultant, advisor or CME speaker for the following identities: Angelini, AstraZeneca, Casen Recordati, Ferrer, Janssen Cilag, and Lundbeck, Lundbeck-Otsuka, SEI Healthcare, FEDER, Secretaria d&#x2019;Universitats i Recerca del Departament d&#x2019;Economia i Coneixement (2017SGR1365), CERCA Programme/Generalitat de Catalunya, Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and Instituto de Salud Carlos III (PI16/00187, PI19/00954).

Since the 2008 global economic crisis, the pace of reduction in poverty and income inequality in the LAC region has stalled. The region is characterised by high levels of inequities and is also vulnerable to many natural disasters. Food systems are changing with increased availability and marketing of packaged and fast foods and sugar-sweetened drinks. Adolescence is a formative phase of the life course with multiple physical, emotional and social changes which can make them vulnerable to health problems. We assess the potential impact of macro-determinants, human and economic development as well as income inequality, on 2 top-ranking regional priorities for adolescent nutrition and mental health, using measures of overweight and suicidal ideation and planning which some have shown to be associated. The Global School-based Health Survey (GSHS) is a nationally representative self-administered, school-based survey. We examined overweight/obesity and suicidal ideation with planning by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita or human development index (HDI) in 10-19-year-old adolescents from 21 LAC countries between 2009 and 2013. Sample sizes varied from 943 in Anguilla to 27,988 in Argentina. A total of 55,295 adolescents had a measure of overweight/obesity status, and 59,061 adolescents reported about suicidal ideation with planning. There was equal representation by sex in the surveys (52% girls and 48% boys). A total of 28.8% of boys and 28.1% of girls had overweight/obesity, and 7.5% of boys and 17.5% of girls reported suicidal ideation with planning over the last 12 months. Adjusted for individual socioeconomic and risk behaviours, and relative to the highest GDP per capita tertile, the middle tertile was associated with 42% (95% confidence interval (CI) 59% to 17%, p = 0.003) and 32% (95% CI 60% to 5%, p = 0.023), and the lowest tertile with 40% (95% CI 55% to 19%, p = 0.001) and 46% (95% CI 59% to 29%, p &lt; 0.001) lower chances of overweight/obesity for girls and boys, respectively. A similar positive effect was seen with HDI, with lowest chances of overweight in the lowest tertile compared with the highest tertile for both sexes. Overweight/obesity was positively related with suicidal ideation with planning for girls (odds ratio (OR) 1.12, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.22, p = 0.009) and weakly related for boys (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.24, p = 0.182). In contrast to overweight/obesity status, suicidal ideation with planning was not related to macro-level indices despite both outcomes sharing common individual socioeconomic and risk behaviour correlates. Limitations include the dominance of Argentinians in the sample (40%), the exclusion of vulnerable adolescents who dropped out of school, and reporting bias due to stigma of mental health-related issues. This study shows that economic and human development were positively associated with adolescent overweight/obesity but not with suicidal ideation with planning. We also observed an interconnectedness between overweight/obesity and suicide ideation with planning among girls. These findings highlight the importance of strategies that engage with both upstream and downstream determinants to improve adolescent nutrition and mental health.",2020,12,1,"PLoS medicine","10.1371/journal.pmed.1003443","PMC7771665","PLoS Med","eng","D000293; D000294; D000367; D017691; D002648; D002652; D003430; D005260; D006306; D006801; D007843; D008297; D008603; D063766; D018570; D012307; D012737; D059020; D055815","Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Age Factors; Caribbean Region; Child; Child Behavior; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Latin America; Male; Mental Health; Pediatric Obesity; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Suicidal Ideation; Young Adult","MR/R022739/1; MR/N015959/1","10.1016/j.jad.2018.05.028; 10.1186/2046-4053-4-4; 10.1176/ps.2010.61.3.218; 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32129-3; 10.1210/er.2010-0028; 10.1111/j.1753-4887.2011.00456.x; 10.1111/obr.12107; 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60741-8; 10.1038/s41574-020-00411-y; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60368-7; 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2008.10.013; 10.1038/mp.2013.54; 10.1111/sltb.12244; 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005867; 10.1177/0004867417717795; 10.1542/peds.2014-3549E; 10.2471/BLT.15.163295; 10.1007/s00038-018-1196-1; 10.1186/1475-2891-7-1; 10.1111/obr.12694; 10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031816-044604; 10.1016/S0140-6736(19)32497-3; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.08.036; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002968; 10.1038/sj.ijo.0802716; 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2012.01017.x; 10.2196/jmir.9044; 10.1037/ort0000294; 10.2105/AJPH.2007.120253; 10.1136/bmj.j1334; 10.3390/ijerph15071425; 10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32427-9; 10.1037/a0018697","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Department of Nutritional Sciences, School of Life Course Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences &amp; Medicine, King's College London, United Kingdom."

This review aims to support efforts to monitor progress in digital mental health research, ensuring new evidence can guide researchers, clinicians, policymakers and program managers positioned to adopt and implement these digitally-enabled treatments. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, an electronic database search from 2016 to 2020 yielded 37 digital intervention studies for detection, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and/or management of a broad range of mental disorders in 13 LMICs. This date range was selected to update previous reviews. Most studies involved online interventions and many reported feasibility and acceptability, reflected by participant satisfaction or program adherence. About half the studies (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;23) reported clinical benefits based on changes in mental health. For depression and mood disorders, some digital interventions showed improvements in depressive symptoms, quality of life, treatment adherence, and recovery. However, sample sizes were small and studies focused primarily on adults. Further limiting generalizability was the lack of consistency in clinical assessment and measurement tools between studies. No studies reported worsening symptoms, negative acceptability or dissatisfaction with digital interventions, suggesting possible publication bias. While digital interventions show promise, it remains difficult to conclude that digital interventions are effective from these studies, as it is prudent to exercise caution before drawing conclusions about clinical effectiveness. This review reflects continued growth in digital mental health research in LMICs and further highlights the need for rigorous evaluation of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.",2021,1,1,"Journal of psychiatric research","10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.016","PMC8801979","J Psychiatr Res","eng","D000328; D003906; D006801; D001523; D008603; D011203; D011788","Adult; Developing Countries; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Poverty; Quality of Life","U19 MH113211","NA","Conflict of Interest.

T-scores adjusted for age, education, and sex (but not degree of bilingualism), were derived for each test utilizing population-specific normative data. English fluency was assessed via the Controlled Oral Word Association Test in English (F-A-S), and Spanish fluency with ""P-M-R,"" and degree of relative English fluency was calculated as the ratio of English language words over total words produced in both languages. Effects of degree of bilingualism on the NUMBRS battery test scores (raw scores and T-scores) were examined via Pearson's product moment correlation coefficients, and language groups (Spanish dominant vs. relative bilingual) were compared on demographically adjusted T-scores via independent samples t-tests. <b>Results:</b> Higher Spanish-English bilingualism was associated with higher education and SES, and was significantly associated with higher raw scores on all tests, but only associated with higher T-scores on a limited number of tests (i.e., WAIS-III Digit Symbol, Symbol Search, Letter-Number Sequencing and Trails B). <b>Conclusion:</b> Degree of Spanish-English bilingualism generally did not account for significant variance in the normed tests beyond the standard demographic adjustments on most tests.

Caries risk assessment (CRA) is a critical component of ECC management, yet the accuracy, consistency, reproducibility, and longitudinal validation of the available risk assessment techniques are lacking. Molecular and microbial biomarkers represent a potential source for accurate and reliable dental caries risk and onset. Next-generation nucleotide-sequencing technology has made it feasible to profile the composition of the oral microbiota. In the present study, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing was applied to saliva samples that were collected at 6-mo intervals for 24&#x2009;mo from a subset of 56 initially caries-free children from an ongoing cohort of 189 children, aged 1 to 3&#x2009;y, over the 2-y study period; 36 children developed ECC and 20 remained caries free. Analyses from machine learning models of microbiota composition, across the study period, distinguished between affected and nonaffected groups at the time of their initial study visits with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.71 and discriminated ECC-converted from healthy controls at the visit immediately preceding ECC diagnosis with an AUC of 0.89, as assessed by nested cross-validation. <i>Rothia mucilaginosa, Streptococcus</i> sp., and <i>Veillonella parvula</i> were selected as important discriminatory features in all models and represent biomarkers of risk for ECC onset. These findings indicate that oral microbiota as profiled by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing is predictive of ECC onset.",2021,6,1,"Journal of dental research","10.1177/0022034520979926","PMC8142088","J Dent Res","eng","D002675; D003731; D003733; D006801; D064307; D008835; D011788; D012336; D015203; D014678","Child, Preschool; Dental Caries; Dental Caries Susceptibility; Humans; Microbiota; Micrococcaceae; Quality of Life; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Reproducibility of Results; Veillonella","R01 DE013683; R01 DE024985","NA","<b>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</b>The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.","Center for Oral Biology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA."

However, previous studies on social inequalities were mainly focused on family-based factors, such as parental education, parental occupation, and household income. In the present study, we investigated the neural mechanisms underlying more broader social context (e.g., rural verse urban) disparities in selective attention among young adults in China. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 22 college students who had born and grown up in rural areas and 22 students who had born and grown up in urban areas during an auditory selective attention task. Although behavioral performance was not significantly different between groups, attentional differences in the negativity difference (Nd) were significantly larger in the urban group than the rural group. Whole sample analysis with hierarchical regression showed that rural/urban status still made a significant contribution to the prediction of Nd amplitudes even after the effects of age, sex, and various family SES measures (include parents' educational levels and annual household income) were controlled for.

"33333828","Intermittent Fasting, Dietary Modifications, and Exercise for the Control of Gestational Diabetes and Maternal Mood Dysregulation: A Review and a Case Report.","Amira Mohammed Ali, Hiroshi Kunugi","Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common pregnancy-related condition afflicting 5-36% of pregnancies. It is associated with many morbid maternal and fetal outcomes. Mood dysregulations (MDs, e.g., depression, distress, and anxiety) are common among women with GDM, and they exacerbate its prognosis and hinder its treatment. Hence, in addition to early detection and proper management of GDM, treating the associated MDs is crucial. Maternal hyperglycemia and MDs result from a complex network of genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors. This review briefly explores mechanisms that underlie GDM and prenatal MDs.

We hypothesised that this pattern is a function of relative deprivation whereby the severity of individual food insecurity relative to others in a reference group determines its associations with mental health and wellbeing after differences in absolute food insecurity are controlled for. Using survey data from the Gallup World Poll collected in 160 countries and a measure of relative deprivation (Yitzhaki index), we found that relative food insecurity-based on national or regional reference groups-related to more mental health symptoms, lower positive wellbeing and lower life satisfaction after controlling for absolute food insecurity, household income, and country differences. Our analysis also found that relative food insecurity was more strongly related to mental health and wellbeing where the prevalence of food insecurity was lower. The findings underscore the negative health consequences of material deprivation and unfavourable social comparisons. Consistent with relative deprivation theory, individuals who live with constant worries about not getting enough food, have to skip meals, or face chronic hunger are deprived of material and social resources that support mental health and wellbeing, especially in settings where food insecurity is less common and potentially more stigmatised.

We performed a structured search in Medline, Embase, WHO Global Index Medicus and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science databases to identify cohort and case-control studies on chronic pain and SES and its subgroups (SES combined index, educational level, income and occupational status). We extracted study characteristics, outcome measures and measures of association and their 95% CIs. Literature search, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted by two independent researchers. We performed main and subgroup meta-analyses using random-effects model, and formally assessed heterogeneity and publication bias. A total of 45 studies, covering a population of &#x223c;175&#xa0;000 individuals, were meta-analysed, yielding a pooled Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.32 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.44) and 1.16 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.23) for low and medium SES levels, respectively, compared with high level. We obtained similar results in all the subgroup analyses. Heterogeneity was generally moderate to high across strata, and some evidence of publication bias for low socioeconomic status was found. Our results support a moderate increase in the risk of chronic pain for low and medium SES when compared with high SES, a feature that remained constant in all measures of exposure or outcome used.

In Uganda, the highest burden is among young rural people. We aimed to; (i) describe socio-economic status (including schooling), and household poverty in adolescents living with epilepsy (ALE) compared to unaffected counterparts in the same communities and (ii) determine the factors associated with the overall quality of life (QoL). This was a cross-sectional survey nested within a larger study of ALE compared to age-matched healthy community children in Uganda. Between Sept 2016 to Sept 2017, 154 ALE and 154 healthy community controls were consecutively recruited. Adolescents recruited were frequency and age-matched based on age categories 10-14 and 15-19&#x202f;years. Clinical history and standardized assessments were conducted. One control participant had incomplete assessment and was excluded. The primary outcome was overall QoL and key variables assessed were schooling status and household poverty. Descriptive and multivariable linear regression analysis were conducted for independent associations with overall QoL. Mean (SD) age at seizure onset was 8.8 (3.9) years and median (IQR) monthly seizure burden was 2 (1-4). Epilepsy was associated with living in homes with high household poverty; 95/154 (61.7%) ALE lived in the poorest homes compared to 68/153 (44.5%) of the healthy adolescents, p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.001. Nearly two-thirds of ALE had dropped out of school and only 48/154 (31.2%) were currently attending school compared to 136/153 (88.9%) of healthy controls, p&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;0.001. QoL was lowest among ALE who never attended school (p&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;0.001), with primary education (p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.006) compared to those with at least secondary education. Stigma scores [mean(SD)] were highest among ALE in the poorest [69.1(34.6)], and wealthy [70.2(32.2)] quintiles compared to their counterparts in poorer [61.8(31.7)], medium [68.0(32.7)] and wealthiest [61.5(33.3)] quintiles, though not statistically significant (p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.75). After adjusting for covariates, ALE currently attending school had higher overall QoL compared to their counterparts who never attended school (&#x3b2;&#x202f;=&#x202f;4.20, 95%CI: 0.90,7.49, p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.013).

ALE in this rural area are from the poorest households, are more likely to drop out of school and have the lowest QoL. Those with poorer seizure control are most affected. ALE should be included among vulnerable population groups and in addition to schooling, strategies for seizure control and addressing the epilepsy treatment gap in affected homes should be specifically targeted in state poverty eradication programs.",2021,1,1,"Epilepsy &amp; behavior : E&amp;B","10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107584","PMC7613327","Epilepsy Behav","eng","D000293; D002648; D003430; D004827; D006801; D011203; D011788; D014454","Adolescent; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Epilepsy; Humans; Poverty; Quality of Life; Uganda","203077; MR/M025489/1","NA","Declaration of Competing Interest All authors report no conflict of interest.","Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda; Centre for Tropical Neuroscience, Kampala, Uganda; Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome Trust Collaborative Programme, Kilifi, Kenya; Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."

We determine epidemiological distributions for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 using a large dataset (<i>N</i> = 21 000 - 157 000) from the Brazilian Sistema de Informa&#xe7;&#xe3;o de Vigil&#xe2;ncia Epidemiol&#xf3;gica da Gripe database. A joint Bayesian subnational model with partial pooling is used to simultaneously describe the 26 states and one federal district of Brazil, and shows significant variation in the mean of the symptom-onset-to-death time, with ranges between 11.2 and 17.8 days across the different states, and a mean of 15.2 days for Brazil. We find strong evidence in favour of specific probability density function choices: for example, the gamma distribution gives the best fit for onset-to-death and the generalized lognormal for onset-to-hospital-admission. Our results show that epidemiological distributions have considerable geographical variation, and provide the first estimates of these distributions in a low and middle-income setting. At the subnational level, variation in COVID-19 outcome timings are found to be correlated with poverty, deprivation and segregation levels, and weaker correlation is observed for mean age, wealth and urbanicity.",2020,11,1,"Journal of the Royal Society, Interface","10.1098/rsif.2020.0596","PMC7729050","J R Soc Interface","eng","D000293; D000328; D000368; D000369; D001499; D001938; D000086382; D002648; D002675; D005260; D006760; D006761; D006801; D007223; D007231; D008297; D008875; D015233; D058873; D011203; D011336; D000086402; D013997; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bayes Theorem; Brazil; COVID-19; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Hospitalization; Hospitals; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Pandemics; Poverty; Probability; SARS-CoV-2; Time Factors; Young Adult","MC_PC_19012; MR/R015600/1","10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13410-1; 10.1136/bmj.b2840; 10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30243-7; 10.1038/s41586-020-2405-7; 10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30746-7; 10.1101/2020.04.29.20081174; 10.1038/s41591-020-0822-7; 10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15786.1; 10.3390/jcm9020538; 10.1038/s41562-020-0928-4; 10.1590/0102-311x00149420; 10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30285-0; 10.1590/0102-311x00070120; 10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31095-3; 10.1007/s00180-011-0233-9; 10.1214/aoms/1177704481; 10.18637/jss.v076.i01; 10.1214/ss/1028905934; 10.1101/2020.02.26.20028431; 10.1503/cmaj.200711; 10.1136/bmj.m1091; 10.1126/science.abc3517; 10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3; 10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30079-5; 10.25561/78872); 10.1126/science.abc0035; 10.1101/2020.09.16.20194787; 10.1101/2020.08.28.20180463; 10.1371/journal.pone.0232074; 10.1080/01621459.1986.10478240; 10.1080/01621459.1995.10476572","We declare we have no competing interests.","MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics (J-IDEA), School of Public Health, Imperial College London, London, UK."

Recent animal studies have linked paternal early stress exposures with next-generation outcomes. Epigenetic inheritance through the male germline has been suggested to be one of the mechanisms. To test whether paternal ELS, as measured using the Trauma and Distress Scale, is associated with neonate brain development. This cohort study included data from participants from the prospective 2-generation FinnBrain Birth Cohort, which was collected from 2011 to 2015. Pregnant women and the fathers were consecutively recruited at gestational week 12 from maternity clinics in Finland. Magnetic resonance imaging data were analyzed in 2019. Participants in this study were 72 families (infant, father, mother). Paternal exposure to ELS. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the major white-matter tracts of the newborn brain. A total of 72 trios (infant, mother, and father) were analyzed. At the time of delivery, the mean (SD) age was 31.0 (4.4) years for fathers and 30.3 (4.5) years for mothers. Forty-one infants (57%) were boys; mean (SD) child age at inclusion was 26.9 (7.2) days from birth and 205 (8) days from estimated conception. Increasing levels of paternal ELS were associated with higher FA values in the newborn brain in the body of the corpus callosum, right superior corona radiata, and retrolenticular parts of the internal capsule. This association persisted after controlling for maternal ELS, maternal socioeconomic status (SES), maternal body mass index, maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy, child sex, and child age from birth and gestation corrected age when imaged. In additional region-of-interest analyses, the association between FA values and paternal Trauma and Distress Scale sum scores remained statistically significant in the earliest maturing regions of the brain, eg, the genu of the corpus callosum (in the regression models, &#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.00096; 95% CI, 0.00034-0.00158; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.003) and the splenium (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.00090; 95% CI, 0.00000-0.00180; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.049). This cohort study found a statistically significant association between paternal ELS and offspring brain development. This finding may have far-reaching implications in pediatrics, as it suggests the possibility of a novel route of intergenerational inheritance of ELS on next-generation brain development.",2020,11,2,"JAMA network open","10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.24832","PMC7686861","JAMA Netw Open","eng","D000328; D000076783; D016880; D001921; D015331; D057890; D005220; D005260; D006801; D007223; D007231; D008279; D008297; D009035; D018812; D011247; D011297; D011446; D066127","Adult; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Anisotropy; Brain; Cohort Studies; Epigenomics; Fathers; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mothers; Paternal Exposure; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Prospective Studies; White Matter",NA,"10.1073/pnas.1310163110; 10.1016/j.dcn.2016.04.005; 10.1016/j.acap.2015.05.005; 10.1016/j.amepre.2015.07.022; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.07.003; 10.1111/cea.13091; 10.1073/pnas.1508347112; 10.1038/s41398-018-0146-2; 10.1038/mp.2014.80; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.03.025; 10.1038/nrn3818; 10.1136/jmedgenet-2014-102577; 10.1093/ije/dyx173; 10.1001/jama.2013.281053; 10.3402/ejpt.v7.30062; 10.1192/bjp.150.6.782; 10.3174/ajnr.A1004; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.09.015; 10.1002/hbm.10062; 10.3389/fninf.2014.00004; 10.1120/jacmp.v11i1.2927; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.10.019; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.10.068; 10.3389/fnins.2013.00031; 10.1038/nprot.2007.45; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.01.060; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.03.061; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2004.03.016; 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2010.11.006; 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2010.06.002; 10.1146/annurev-psych-010814-015340; 10.3174/ajnr.A0751; 10.1002/hbm.22099; 10.1016/j.dcn.2017.12.002; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.04.060; 10.3389/fgene.2019.00852","<b>Conflict of Interest Disclosures:</b> Dr Scheinin reported receiving grants from Southwest Hospital District and the Signe and Ane Gyllenberg Foundation during the conduct of the study.

"33219303","Regional and network neural activity reflect men's preference for greater socioeconomic status during impression formation.","Denise M Barth, Bradley D Mattan, Tzipporah P Dang, Jasmin Cloutier","Evidence from social psychology suggests that men compared to women more readily display and pursue control over human resources or capital. However, studying how status and gender shape deliberate impression formation is difficult due to social desirability concerns. Using univariate and multivariate fMRI analyses (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;65), we examined how gender and socioeconomic status (SES) may influence brain responses during deliberate but private impression formation. Men more than women showed greater activity in the VMPFC and NAcc when forming impressions of high-SES (vs. low-SES) targets. Seed partial least squares (PLS) analysis showed that this SES-based increase in VMPFC activity was associated with greater co-activation across an evaluative network for the high-SES versus low-SES univariate comparison. A data-driven task PLS analysis also showed greater co-activation in an extended network consisting of regions involved in salience detection, attention, and task engagement as a function of increasing target SES. This co-activating network was most pronounced for men. These findings provide evidence that high-SES targets elicit neural responses indicative of positivity, reward, and salience during impression formation among men. Contributions to a network neuroscience understanding of status perception and implications for gender- and status-based impression formation are discussed.",2020,11,20,"Scientific reports","10.1038/s41598-020-76847-z","PMC7679381","Sci Rep","eng","D000293; D000328; D001921; D005260; D006608; D006801; D016018; D008279; D008297; D009415; D011593; D012201; D012737; D012923; D012928; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Brain; Female; Hierarchy, Social; Humans; Least-Squares Analysis; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Nerve Net; Psychology, Social; Reward; Sex Factors; Social Class; Social Desirability; Young Adult",NA,"10.1177/0963721411414654; 10.5465/19416520802211628; 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00496; 10.1177/1745691616677828; 10.1371/journal.pone.0070589; 10.1177/0146167219835230; 10.1037/0022-3514.43.5.915; 10.1037/0022-3514.54.2.233; 10.1037/0033-295X.109.3.573; 10.1111/j.1559-1816.2011.00781.x; 10.1037/0022-3514.50.1.87; 10.1111/j.1471-6402.2009.01537.x; 10.1037/0022-3514.72.1.141; 10.1037/0003-066X.64.8.644; 10.1037/0033-295X.100.2.204; 10.1037/0022-3514.66.6.1074; 10.1093/scan/nsx128; 10.1523/ENEURO.0039-18.2018; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.06.024; 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.06.010; 10.1073/pnas.1511477112; 10.1038/s41598-019-41544-z; 10.1073/pnas.1802176115; 10.1016/j.copsyc.2018.04.010; 10.1038/nrn3776; 10.1016/j.neuron.2008.01.025; 10.1016/j.cub.2016.09.015; 10.1016/j.cub.2011.03.050; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.04.038; 10.1016/j.neuron.2005.09.025; 10.1093/scan/nsw074; 10.1162/jocn.2009.21052; 10.1038/nn.4502; 10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143804; 10.1037/pspi0000042; 10.1080/17470919.2017.1326400; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.01.031; 10.1093/scan/nsl007; 10.1002/mrm.21150; 10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00073-9; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.06.078; 10.1006/nimg.2001.0746; 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0193(1999)7:4&lt;254::AID-HBM4&gt;3.0.CO;2-G; 10.1162/jocn.2008.20062; 10.1162/jocn_a_00605; 10.18637/jss.v067.i01; 10.18637/jss.v082.i13; 10.1214/ss/1177013815; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.05.018; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.07.020; 10.1073/pnas.1602413113; 10.1038/nrn3857; 10.1016/j.neuron.2008.04.017; 10.1007/s10548-019-00744-6; 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00430; 10.1073/pnas.1315235110; 10.1016/j.neuron.2014.05.014; 10.1111/psyp.12566; 10.1101/2020.06.20.162255; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2159-13.2014; 10.21500/20112084.721; 10.1038/s41562-017-0072; 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.09.023; 10.1016/j.cortex.2019.09.018; 10.1016/j.cub.2006.02.013; 10.1098/rsbl.2011.0881; 10.1037/xge0000167; 10.1177/0146167211407210; 10.1016/j.jesp.2013.08.007; 10.1037/0022-3514.40.1.147; 10.1017/S0140525X00023992; 10.1162/jocn_a_00553; 10.1093/scan/nsx052; 10.1016/S0277-9536(02)00073-4; 10.1080/1047840X.2013.792576; 10.1037/pspa0000091; 10.1037/xge0000023; 10.1038/s41562-019-0782-4; 10.1111/jasp.12136; 10.1007/s11199-015-0450-8; 10.1093/cercor/bhp195; 10.1037/0022-3514.88.6.885; 10.1080/17470910701563483; 10.1177/147470490800600209; 10.1037/0033-2909.85.4.845; 10.1037/0033-295X.107.3.411; 10.1016/0191-8869(84)90025-4; 10.1038/srep45920; 10.1016/j.neuron.2016.10.052; 10.1007/s11218-019-09489-3; 10.1037/a0029826; 10.1177/0963721410383248; 10.1093/joc/jqy003; 10.1038/s41593-020-0658-y","The authors declare no competing interests.","Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of Delaware, 105 The Green, Newark, DE, 19716, USA."

University students are particularly vulnerable to such disruptions and may be particularly disposed to suicidal ideation, potentially creating a new public health crisis. This study aimed to assess suicidal ideation and associated factors among university students in Bangladesh during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using the Google form (Google survey tool) from April to May 2020. Initially, 3366 respondents voluntarily completed the survey form. Finally, 3331 surveys were included in the final analyses after removing incomplete surveys. The data ware reviewed, rechecked, and analyzed with SPSS (25.0 version) software. A total of 1979 (59.4%) males and 1352 (40.6%) females participated. Respondents were between the ages of 18 to 28&#xa0;years (mean age 21.4&#xa0;years [SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.9]). The prevalence estimate of suicidal ideation was 12.8%. Potential risk factors included less sleep, excess sleep, cigarette smoking, past suicidal thoughts, suicide attempt history, family history of suicidality, depression, anxiety, and stress.

It is unclear, however, how sets of polygenic scores, which partly capture environmental effects, perform jointly with sets of environmental measures, which are themselves heritable, in prediction models of educational achievement. Here, for the first time, we systematically investigate gene-environment correlation (rGE) and interaction (GxE) in the joint analysis of multiple genome-wide polygenic scores (GPS) and multiple environmental measures as they predict tested educational achievement (EA). We predict EA in a representative sample of 7,026 16-year-olds, with 20 GPS for psychiatric, cognitive and anthropometric traits, and 13 environments (including life events, home environment, and SES) measured earlier in life. Environmental and GPS predictors were modelled, separately and jointly, in penalized regression models with out-of-sample comparisons of prediction accuracy, considering the implications that their interplay had on model performance. Jointly modelling multiple GPS and environmental factors significantly improved prediction of EA, with cognitive-related GPS adding unique independent information beyond SES, home environment and life events. We found evidence for rGE underlying variation in EA (rGE = .38; 95% CIs = .30, .45). We estimated that 40% (95% CIs = 31%, 50%) of the polygenic scores effects on EA were mediated by environmental effects, and in turn that 18% (95% CIs = 12%, 25%) of environmental effects were accounted for by the polygenic model, indicating genetic confounding. Lastly, we did not find evidence that GxE effects significantly contributed to multivariable prediction. Our multivariable polygenic and environmental prediction model suggests widespread rGE and unsystematic GxE contributions to EA in adolescence.",2020,11,1,"PLoS genetics","10.1371/journal.pgen.1009153","PMC7721131","PLoS Genet","</AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Plomin</LastName><ForeName>Robert</ForeName><Initials>R</Initials><Identifier Source=""ORCID"">0000-0002-0756-3629</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, United Kingdom.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng","D000293; D041923; D004522; D005260; D059647; D055106; D060005; D006801; D008297; D008957; D020412; D006113","Adolescent; Adolescent Development; Educational Status; Female; Gene-Environment Interaction; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotyping Techniques; Humans; Male; Models, Genetic; Multifactorial Inheritance; United Kingdom","G19/2; MR/M021475/1; G0901245; R01 AG046938","10.1038/s41539-018-0030-0; 10.1038/ng.3285; 10.1371/journal.pgen.1007757; 10.1038/s41562-018-0525-y; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01803.x; 10.1126/science.1083968; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.18070881; 10.1177/1745691614556682; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2011.11020191; 10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.06.005; 10.1111/jcpp.12295; 10.1038/s41588-018-0147-3; 10.1038/s41380-019-0394-4; 10.1017/S0033291715002172; 10.1111/add.14712; 10.1073/pnas.1802909115; 10.1007/s10519-018-9940-0; 10.1038/s41598-018-24774-5; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2017.09.009; 10.1111/jcpp.12995; 10.1073/pnas.1707178114; 10.1037/dev0000709; 10.1017/thg.2018.11; 10.1126/science.aan6877; 10.1016/j.ajhg.2019.06.006; 10.1038/mp.2017.163; 10.1037/pspp0000089; 10.1038/mp.2015.126; 10.1073/pnas.1507583112; 10.1080/10618600.2014.938812; 10.1002/gepi.22092; 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003348; 10.1002/gepi.22050; 10.1177/1745691615617439; 10.1007/s10519-014-9673-7; 10.1038/mp.2015.2; 10.1017/thg.2018.75; 10.1111/jcpp.13070; 10.1093/bioinformatics/btv546; 10.1038/s41588-018-0152-6; 10.1038/s41467-018-07882-8; 10.1038/s41588-019-0344-8; 10.1038/s41588-018-0090-3; 10.1038/s41588-019-0397-8; 10.1038/s41588-018-0059-2; 10.1038/s41588-018-0269-7; 10.1038/mp.2017.154; 10.1038/s41588-019-0439-2; 10.1038/mp.2017.77; 10.1038/s41593-018-0326-7; 10.1038/ng.3552; 10.1038/s41588-017-0013-8; 10.1038/s41588-018-0333-3; 10.1038/s41588-018-0309-3; 10.1093/hmg/ddy271; 10.1023/a:1026595011371","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, United Kingdom."

We review existing research related to what factors might affect sibling-ToM association and how these potential factors affect ToM. Based on the literature review, we propose an integrative model that unites three categories of factors (i.e., sibling structural variables, sibling individual variables, parental intervening variables) that might have effects on the sibling-ToM association and highlights mental-state talks during sibling interactions at the intersection of sibling-related variables and ToM. Furthermore, we propose some issues arising from this review that need to be clarified in future studies. Specifically, we hope to clarify the specific effects of older and younger siblings on children's understanding of human minds, the similarities and differences of sibling-ToM association under different cultural backgrounds, and the impact of family social disadvantage (e.g., lower SES) on the sibling-ToM association.

"33192775","Neural Correlate Differences in Number Sense Between Children With Low and Middle/High Socioeconomic Status.","Qing Bao, Li Jin Zhang, Yuan Liang, Yan Bang Zhou, Gui Li Shi","Although some cognitive studies provided reasons that children with low socioeconomic status (SES) showed poor mathematical achievements, there was no explicit evidence to directly explain the root of lagged performance in children with low SES. Therefore, the present study explored the differences in neural correlates in the process of symbolic magnitude comparison between children with different SESs by the event-related potentials (ERPs). A total of 16 second-graders from low-SES families and 16 from middle/high-SES families participated in this study. According to the results of anterior N1 (early attention) and P2 (extraction of numerical meaning) over the frontal region, the differences among children with different SESs were manifested as differences in general neural activities in terms of attention and top-down cognitive control. In the late stage of cognitive processing, there was no significant difference in the average amplitude of the late positive component (LPC) between children with different SES, indicating that low SES did not influence the information encoding and memory updating of numerical representation, which was responsible by the parietal lobe.

However, we have a limited understanding of the psychological pathways through which Black Americans with schizophrenia reach worse outcomes. This study assessed race and domains of functioning (e.g., neurocognition, functional capacity) known to be associated with objective outcomes in a sample of 108 non-Hispanic Black and 61 non-Hispanic White individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders from the Social Cognition Psychometric Evaluation (SCOPE) study. Three primary findings emerged: First, Black participants showed lower scores than White participants on measures of neurocognition(NC), social cognition(SC), and everyday living skills, but not social skills or community functioning. Second, neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) explained 21% of the relationship between race and NC but did not mediate the relationship between race and SC or everyday living skills. Finally, prior research has established that NC, SC, social skills, and everyday living skills predict community functioning in individuals. Finally, prior research has established that NC, SC, social skills, and everyday living skills predict community functioning in individuals with schizophrenia.&#xa0;In our sample, after controlling for neighborhood SES, race did not moderate the relationships of NC, SC, social skills, or everyday living skills to community functioning. This indicates that relationships between these domains are comparably strong across Black and White Americans. Taken together, these findings show that NC, SC, and everyday living skills may be important areas to explore in regards to racial disparities in schizophrenia. More research, especially incorporating nuanced race- and SES-related variables, is needed to understand how to best intervene and improve real-world outcomes for Black Americans with schizophrenia.",2020,10,1,"Schizophrenia research","10.1016/j.schres.2020.09.020",NA,"Schizophr Res","eng","D001741; D006801; D012111; D012559; D012923; D044465","Black or African American; Humans; Residence Characteristics; Schizophrenia; Social Class; White People","R01 MH093432","NA","Declaration of competing interest Dr. Harvey serves as a consultant/advisory board member for Boeheringer Ingelheim, Lundbeck, Otsuka Digital Heath, Roche, Sanofi, Sunovion, and Takeda.

Accurately predicting suicidal behavior remains challenging. This study aimed to use machine learning approaches to examine the potential of the Swedish national registry data for prediction of suicidal behavior. The study sample consisted of 541,300 inpatient and outpatient visits by 126,205 Sweden-born patients (54% female and 46% male) aged 18 to 39 (mean age at the visit: 27.3) years to psychiatric specialty care in Sweden between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2012. The most common psychiatric diagnoses at the visit were anxiety disorders (20.0%), major depressive disorder (16.9%), and substance use disorders (13.6%). A total of 425 candidate predictors covering demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status (SES), electronic medical records, criminality, as well as family history of disease and crime were extracted from the Swedish registry data. The sample was randomly split into an 80% training set containing 433,024 visits and a 20% test set containing 108,276 visits. Models were trained separately for suicide attempt/death within 90 and 30 days following a visit using multiple machine learning algorithms. Model discrimination and calibration were both evaluated. Among all eligible visits, 3.5% (18,682) were followed by a suicide attempt/death within 90 days and 1.7% (9,099) within 30 days. The final models were based on ensemble learning that combined predictions from elastic net penalized logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and a neural network. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) on the test set were 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.87-0.89) and 0.89 (95% CI = 0.88-0.90) for the outcome within 90 days and 30 days, respectively, both being significantly better than chance (i.e., AUC = 0.50) (p &lt; 0.01). Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were reported at different risk thresholds. A limitation of our study is that our models have not yet been externally validated, and thus, the generalizability of the models to other populations remains unknown. By combining the ensemble method of multiple machine learning algorithms and high-quality data solely from the Swedish registers, we developed prognostic models to predict short-term suicide attempt/death with good discrimination and calibration.

Up to 40% of multiple sclerosis patients treated with interferon &#x3b2; (IFN&#x3b2;) develop ADA, for which a genetic predisposition exists. Here, we present a genome-wide association study on ADA and predict the occurrence of antibodies in multiple sclerosis patients treated with different interferon &#x3b2; preparations. We analyzed a large sample of 2757 genotyped and imputed patients from two cohorts (Sweden and Germany), split between a discovery and a replication dataset. Binding ADA (bADA) levels were measured by capture-ELISA, neutralizing ADA (nADA) titers using a bioassay. Genome-wide association analyses were conducted stratified by cohort and treatment preparation, followed by fixed-effects meta-analysis. Binding ADA levels and nADA titers were correlated and showed a significant heritability (47% and 50%, respectively). The risk factors differed strongly by treatment preparation: The top-associated and replicated variants for nADA presence were the HLA-associated variants rs77278603 in IFN&#x3b2;-1a s.c.- (odds ratio (OR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.55 (95% confidence interval&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.81-4.48), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.1&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10<sup>-26</sup>) and rs28366299 in IFN&#x3b2;-1b s.c.-treated patients (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.56 (2.69-4.72), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;6.6&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10<sup>-19</sup>). The rs77278603-correlated HLA haplotype DR15-DQ6 conferred risk specifically for IFN&#x3b2;-1a s.c.

The haplotype DR4-DQ3 was the major risk haplotype for IFN&#x3b2;-1b s.c. (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;7.35 (4.33-12.47), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.5&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10<sup>-13</sup>). These haplotypes exhibit large population-specific frequency differences. The best prediction models were achieved for ADA in IFN&#x3b2;-1a s.c.-treated patients. Here, the prediction in the Swedish cohort showed AUC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.91 (0.85-0.95), sensitivity&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.78, and specificity&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.90; patients with the top 30% of genetic risk had, compared to patients in the bottom 30%, an OR&#xa0;=&#x2009;73.9 (11.8-463.6, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.4&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10<sup>-6</sup>) of developing nADA.

Several studies demonstrated the positive effects of Brassicaceae vegetables on obesity and related diseases, partially attributing these beneficial properties to glucosinolates and their derivatives isothiocyanates. Recently, isothiocyanates have been described as a hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub> S)-releasing moiety, suggesting that H<sub>2</sub> S may be at least in part responsible for the beneficial effects of Brassicaceae. In this work, the metabolic effects of an extract obtained from Eruca sativa Mill. seeds (E.S., Brassicaceae), containing high levels of glucoerucin, were evaluated in an experimental model of obesity. Male balb/c mice were fed for 10&#x2009;weeks with standard (Std) diet or high fat (HF) diet supplemented with E.S. E.S. significantly contained the body weight gain in this obesity model, improving also glucose homeostasis. Interestingly, lower values of white adipose tissue mass and a significant reduction of adipocytes size were also observed. Moreover, E.S. enhanced the adipocytes metabolism, improving the citrate synthase activity and reduced triglyceride levels in mice fed with HF diet. Taken together, these results suggest that E.S. is endowed with an interesting translational and nutraceutical value in the prevention of metabolic disorders, suggesting that H<sub>2</sub> S could be a key player.",2021,4,1,"Phytotherapy research : PTR","10.1002/ptr.6941",NA,"Phytother Res","eng","D000818; D001937; D059305; D007004; D008297; D051379; D009765; D010936; D012639","Animals; Brassica; Diet, High-Fat; Hypoglycemic Agents; Male; Mice; Obesity; Plant Extracts; Seeds","32678; 1741 of 05/07/2018; PRA2017_26; 2017XP72RF","NA",NA,"Department of Pharmacy, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy."

The association of depression with blood pressure (BP) might depend upon socioeconomic status (SES), but evidence remains weak. This study aimed to examine how the associations between depressive symptoms and BP levels and hypertension and then, according to SES variables (education, income, occupational status). Among 66,478 volunteers of the French CONSTANCES cohort (31,093 men; mean age (standard deviation): 47.8 (12.9) years), depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D). Overall associations between depressive symptoms and BP and hypertension were estimated using regressions and by stratifying on SES. SES were associated with BP in both genders. CES-D score was negatively associated with systolic BP (SBP) in women (b=-0.62 95%CI [-1.03; -0.21] and in men (b=-1.03 95%CI [-1.45; -0.61]) but not with diastolic BP (DBP) in both genders. In women, the decrease in SBP and DBP was more pronounced as educational level increases (p for interaction: 0.012 and 0.013, respectively). In men, few interactions were observed between CES-D score and SES factors for BP levels. The association between CES-D score and hypertension was significant for men, OR=0.86, 95%CI [0.80; 0.93] but not for women, OR=1.03, 95%CI [0.96; 1.10].

However, this evidence has rarely been obtained in middle and low-income countries like Guatemala, where food insecurity and exposure to violence frequently threaten childhood development. The aim of this study was to analyse the relations that sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors have with psychological adjustment of low-socioeconomic status (SES) Guatemalan children and adolescents, and how these relations were mediated by food insecurity and exposure to violence. A total of 185 participants (50.8% girls; aged between 6 to 17, M = 11.82, SD = 3.7) from three vulnerable schools located in rural and urban areas of Guatemala were assessed. The results indicated that exposure to violence significantly moderates the effect of sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables in measures of depression, anxiety and health-related quality of life. Adolescents more exposed to violence reported higher levels of depression and anxiety, as well as lower levels of health-related quality of life. In contrast, food insecurity did not seem to influence psychological adjustment outcomes in this low-SES sample. These findings highlight the relevance of exposure to violence for mental health and well-being, and is a factor that should be considered when designing public health policies to promote children and adolescents' welfare.",2020,10,19,"International journal of environmental research and public health","10.3390/ijerph17207620","PMC7589969","Int J Environ Res Public Health","eng","D000293; D002648; D000069581; D005260; D006166; D006801; D008603; D011788; D012923","Adolescent; Child; Exposure to Violence; Female; Guatemala; Humans; Mental Health; Quality of Life; Social Class",NA,"10.1111/desc.12076; 10.2307/1131385; 10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.003; 10.1037/0003-066X.59.2.77; 10.1016/0147-1767(94)90036-1; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61238-0; 10.1017/S2045796015001158; 10.1093/inthealth/ihy081; 10.1136/ip.7.4.297; 10.1590/S0104-11692013000200016; 10.1016/j.semerg.2019.02.007; 10.1073/pnas.1604756114; 10.1093/scan/nsv045; 10.1016/S0006-3223(01)01129-5; 10.1007/s10802-017-0370-x; 10.1111/j.1467-9450.2010.00859.x; 10.1186/s12888-019-2380-4; 10.1016/j.jad.2008.12.008; 10.18203/2394-6040.ijcmph20170763; 10.1016/j.chc.2012.05.001; 10.1016/j.rpsm.2012.01.005; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2018.10.302; 10.1016/j.jaac.2012.09.009; 10.3945/jn.116.232298; 10.1016/j.pedn.2019.11.001; 10.1080/13548506.2016.1274411; 10.1590/S1020-49892012000500009; 10.1186/s12889-017-4348-y; 10.1016/j.ypmed.2012.12.018; 10.2471/BLT.08-060061; 10.1007/BF03404503; 10.1007/s12519-018-0158-2; 10.1186/s12955-016-0558-8; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2016.05.001; 10.1016/j.adolescence.2013.03.006; 10.1007/s11136-018-1881-9; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.04.013; 10.1007/s12187-013-9183-9; 10.3233/NRE-172275; 10.1037/h0087690; 10.1007/s11136-010-9706-5; 10.1016/S0005-7967(99)00130-8; 10.1016/j.jad.2017.04.022; 10.5944/rppc.vol.15.num.3.2010.4095; 10.5694/mja12.10628; 10.1016/j.jaac.2010.05.017; 10.1037/0278-6133.21.3.254; 10.3109/01612840903200027; 10.1037/a0039501; 10.1111/j.1365-2850.2008.01321.x; 10.1023/A:1027386430859; 10.1006/jado.1998.0198; 10.1016/S1054-139X(02)00404-4; 10.1111/j.1939-0025.2011.01135.x; 10.1017/S0954579498001539; 10.5093/in2011v20n2a2; 10.1023/B:CCFP.0000006293.77143.e1; 10.1037/gpr0000005","The authors declare no conflict of interest.

"33078172","A systematic review of olfactory related questionnaires and scales.","P Han, T Su, M Qin, H Chen, T Hummel","Although neglected by science for a long time, the sense of olfaction has received increasing attention from research areas including psychology, neuroscience, clinical medicine and nutrition. With the rise of psychophysical and neuroimaging re- search into olfaction, psychometric tools (e.g. questionnaires and scales) are the basis for the quantitative exploration of inter-in- dividual variability regarding olfactory related responses. The current systematic review is to summarize existing olfaction related questionnaires and/or scales. Peer-reviewed literature on scales and questionnaires related to perception of odors were searched from online databa- ses (PubMed, Web of Science and PsycINFO). Twenty-one articles that meet the following criteria were included in the review: ""human species"", ""physical odor stimuli"" and ""describing the original development of the tool"" and ""specific focus on olfaction or odor related responses or behaviors"". The psychometric properties, advantages and possible disadvantages were discussed. Existing psychometric measures focus on various aspects of olfactory related responses and behaviors, including af- fective experiences of odor perception, awareness and attitude towards olfaction, olfactory function and the quality of life change due to olfactory dysfunction, and the ability to create vivid mental odor images. While most of them have been tested to have good reliability and validity, some were relatively time-consuming due to the number of questionnaire items. Besides, although many measures have been used in clinical populations, few have provided information on the predictive validity regarding effecti- veness of clinical intervention on changes of certain responses or behaviors. The current review provides an overview of olfactory related questionnaires and scales, highlighting the emotional and affective impact of olfaction and the impact on quality of life due to olfactory dysfunction. With growing interest in olfaction as an important sense, the development and use of psychometrically sound measurements in conjunction with objective assess- ments will advance our understanding of human olfaction and olfactory dysfunction. The review provides a guide for researchers and clinicians alike to select olfactory scales suitable for olfactory research with different experimental purposes and specific samples.",2021,4,1,"Rhinology","10.4193/Rhin20.291",NA,"Rhinology","eng","D006801; D009812; D055696; D011788; D015203; D012903; D011795","Humans; Odorants; Olfactory Perception; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Smell; Surveys and Questionnaires",NA,"NA",NA,"Interdisciplinary Centre Smell and Taste, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany."

The objective of this review is to synthesise findings on the effectiveness of MMH interventions to improve child-related outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We searched for randomised controlled trials conducted in LMICs evaluating interventions with a MMH component and reporting children's outcomes. Meta-analysis was performed on outcomes included in at least two trials. We identified 21 trials with 28 284 mother-child dyads. Most trials were conducted in middle-income countries, evaluating home visiting interventions delivered by general health workers, starting in the third trimester of pregnancy. Only ten trials described acceptable methods for blinding outcome assessors. Four trials showed high risk of bias in at least two of the seven domains assessed in this review. Narrative synthesis showed promising but inconclusive findings for child-related outcomes. Meta-analysis identified a sizeable impact of interventions on exclusive breastfeeding (risk ratio = 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-1.71, ten trials, N = 4749 mother-child dyads, I2 = 61%) and a small effect on child height-for-age at 6-months (std. mean difference = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.02-0.24, three trials, N = 1388, I2 = 0%). Meta-analyses did not identify intervention benefits for child cognitive and other growth outcomes; however, few trials measured these outcomes. These findings support the importance of MMH to improve child-related outcomes in LMICs, particularly exclusive breastfeeding.

It is unclear whether these represent a single or independent correlates. We studied 110 Ecuadorian youths aged 12-17 with measures of SES, language, executive function, and theory of mind (ToM), a.k.a. mentalizing. A subsample gave hair samples to estimate recent cortisol levels. Restricting analyses to reliable measures, SES was highly associated with language skill, and to a lesser extent with executive function and ToM performance. However, those latter associations were attenuated and non-significant when language ability was controlled for statistically. Systemic cortisol levels were not associated with SES, but were significantly and negatively correlated with ToM, independent of variation in language skills. We conclude that language development underlies most of the impact of SES on executive function and ToM ability of adolescents, but that stress-related cortisol may have an independent, direct effect on mentalizing.",2021,3,1,"The British journal of developmental psychology","10.1111/bjdp.12354","PMC7894514","Br J Dev Psychol","eng","D000293; D000078022; D056344; D006801; D006854; D007802; D009483; D056345","Adolescent; Economic Status; Executive Function; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Language; Neuropsychological Tests; Theory of Mind",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0138217; 10.1023/A:1023035012436; 10.1037/a0028087; 10.1111/1469-7610.00749; 10.1348/026151009x485432; 10.1001/jama.294.22.2879; 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2019.107308; 10.1016/j.infbeh.2014.04.008; 10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.155; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05334.x; 10.1037/pne0000036; 10.1111/cdev.13065; 10.1016/j.tics.2020.01.007; 10.1016/j.jecp.2019.104739; 10.1007/s11205-015-0994-6; 10.1177/0743558400153005; 10.1016/j.brainres.2006.06.072; 10.1037/neu0000216; 10.1136/jech.2004.023531; 10.1371/journal.pone.0129612; 10.1016/j.paid.2016.06.069; 10.1037/a0024912; 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00277; 10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.003; 10.1017/CBO9781139105729.001; 10.1093/deafed/enq031; 10.3758/s13428-017-0935-1; 10.1017/S0140525X0999152X; 10.1207/s15326942dn2802_4; 10.1080/10253890701365527; 10.5395/rde.2013.38.1.52; 10.1093/jpepsy/jst034; 10.1111/desc.12096; 10.1002/smi.942; 10.1016/s0006-3223(00)00965-3; 10.1146/annurev.psych.031809.130711; 10.1111/cdep.12305; 10.1006/cogp.1999.0734; 10.1111/acps.12142; 10.1073/pnas.1304437110; 10.1038/nn.3983; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2012.01147.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00600.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2005.00394.x; 10.1080/21622965.2019.1629922; 10.1007/s11469-014-9523-0; 10.1080/09297049.2017.1294150; 10.1017/S1355617712000604; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2011.09.009; 10.1080/09297049.2013.763921; 10.1017/S1355617710001335; 10.25011/cim.v30i5.2894; 10.1037/0012-1649.39.4.717; 10.1017/S1355617709990804; 10.1111/cdev.12376; 10.1111/bjdp.12307; 10.5964/ejop.v11i1.829; 10.1037/0033-2909.131.2.301; 10.1080/87565641.2012.733786; 10.3758/s13423-018-1459-0; 10.1136/jech.56.8.595; 10.1037/12057-013; 10.11144/Javerianacali.PPSI16-2.retm; 10.1111/j.1750-8606.2012.00246.x","All authors declare no conflict of interest.","Institute of Neurosciences, Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Ecuador."

This study examined the frequency of NLEs and whether specific types of NLEs were associated with increased risk of having an anxiety disorder 6.5&#xa0;years post&#xa0;randomization. Participants were 319 adolescents and adults, ages 11 to 26 (M&#x2009;=&#x2009;17), enrolled in Child/Adolescent Anxiety&#xa0;Multimodal&#xa0;Extended&#xa0;Long-term&#xa0;Study. At their first follow-up visit, participants completed a diagnostic interview and a 40-item Life Events Scale that reflected whether specific events occurred since their last post treatment assessment. Life events were categorized into domains (i.e., family, academic, health, and social) via researcher consensus. Participants reported having experienced an average of four NLEs. Participants with an anxiety disorder at follow-up were significantly more likely to have failed a grade in school (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.9) and experienced a negative change in acceptance by peers (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.9; ps&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).

Globally, there is a need to better understand risk factors for adolescent depression to inform policies for effective prevention initiatives. A Delphi consensus study was conducted on risk factors, early signs, and detection strategies for adolescent depression in global settings. Over 3 survey rounds, global experts formulated and ranked these variables for (1) specificity for adolescent depression and (2) feasibility of measurement (round 1, n=21 participants; rounds 2 and 3, n=17). We calculated Smith's salience index as a measure of consensus. Interviews were conducted with 10 participants to elicit qualitative reflections on the ranking results, and on the influence of cultural and contextual factors on depression risks. Thirty-one risk factors for adolescent depression were generated. Panelists ranked three as highly specific and highly feasible to measure: family history of depression, exposure to bullying, and a negative family environment. Six were ranked as modestly specific and highly feasible: physical illness or disability, female sex, bereavement, trauma exposure, substance abuse, and low self-esteem. An additional 5 items were modestly specific and modestly feasible: social difficulties, academic stress, poverty, loss of family, and cognitive distortions. Five symptoms were at least modestly specific and feasible to measure: mood changes, loss of interest, social isolation, suicidality, and sleep changes. Schools were considered the most feasible place for screening. The participants were not representative of all countries and cultural regions.

We assessed whether the presence of a neighborhood park is associated with pediatric physical or mental health across the U.S. using a nationally representative cross-sectional random sample of American children ages 0-17. Caregivers reported on the park presence in their child's neighborhood and the child's physical activity, screen-time, sleep, weight, and diagnosis of anxiety, depression, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Covariates included child and family sociodemographics and, for 29 states, neighborhood urbanicity. Caregivers reported on 49,146 children (mean age 9.4&#xa0;years; 49% female). There were 11,791 (24%) children living in neighborhoods lacking a park; children in non-urban locations (aOR 2.19, 95% CI 1.40-1.67) or below the federal poverty level (aOR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.48, 95%CI 1.38-1.58) had higher odds of lacking a park.

There is not sufficient evidence to estimate potential environmental risk factors for NMOSD; therefore, many predisposing factors may remain unknown. The present study assessed the possible associations of ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and stressful life events with NMOSD risk after adjustment for sex and age in an Iranian population. This population-based case-control study included NMOSD cases and healthy controls in Tehran, Iran. Diagnosis of disease was confirmed by neurologists based on the 2015 International Consensus Criteria (ICC). Controls were sex-matched with cases and had no history of any neurological disorders. The telephone interviews were administered to gather pertinent data. Matched logistic regression was used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using SPSS. This study recruited 153 NMOSD cases and 400 controls with the case-control ratio of 1: 2.61 and mean ages (SD) of 37.11 (10.90) and 33.67 (8.37) years, respectively (p &lt; 0.001).

Our findings demonstrate a distinct income-related outcome gradient. Thirty percent of children in the lowest-income neighborhoods were vulnerable in one or more domains of health development, compared with 17&#xa0;percent of children in higher-income settings. Significantly higher rates of income-related Early Development Instrument vulnerability-defined as children falling below the tenth-percentile cutoff on any Early Development Instrument domain-were demonstrated for Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx children. These findings underscore the utility of the Early Development Instrument as a way for communities to measure child health equity gaps and inform the design, implementation, and performance of multisector place-based child health initiatives.

The primary objective of this study was to determine the association between neighbourhood SES and developmental vulnerability of kindergarten children with ASD while controlling for family SES across 10 provinces and territories in Canada. This study used data from a population level database of child development in kindergarten, collected with the Early Development Instrument (EDI). The EDI covers five broad domains of developmental health: physical health and well-being, social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive development, and communication skills and general knowledge. Neighbourhood SES was assessed with an SES index created using 10 variables from the 2011 Canadian Census and 2010 Taxfiler data. Family SES was assessed using 4 variables from the 2016 Canadian Census. Descriptive statistics and regression-based models were used in this study. Multilevel binary logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between neighbourhood SES and child developmental vulnerability (yes/no), at the individual level, while controlling for family SES, demographic characteristics, and neighbourhood clustering. The association between neighbourhood SES and child developmental vulnerability at the individual level, while controlling for family SES and demographic characteristics was examined with binary single level logistic regression analyses. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to examine the association between neighbourhood SES and developmental vulnerability at the neighbourhood level (% of kindergarten children with ASD demonstrating developmental vulnerability in a neighbourhood). In Ontario, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Newfoundland and Labrador, higher neighbourhood SES was associated with lower likelihood of developmental vulnerability. In Nova Scotia, higher neighbourhood SES was associated with higher likelihood of vulnerability in the social competence and communication skills and general knowledge domains. These findings emphasize the importance of addressing neighbourhood deprivation to support the development of children with ASD. Additionally, the inconsistency highlights the importance of examining the mechanisms through which neighbourhood SES impacts development of these children on a provincial basis.",2020,12,1,"SSM - population health","10.1016/j.ssmph.2020.100662","PMC7522116","SSM Popul Health","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1007/s10803-006-0194-y; 10.1186/s12939-015-0207-6; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.05.028; 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-050212-185634; 10.1371/journal.pone.0141964; 10.1177/0145445506291396; 10.1136/jech.2010.111773; 10.1097/00001888-200412000-00004; 10.1007/s12187-019-09666-y; 10.1542/peds.2011-1601; 10.1016/j.cognition.2018.10.022; 10.1016/j.conb.2007.01.009; 10.3389/fpsyt.2012.00118; 10.1371/journal.pone.0004683; 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012020; 10.1111/cdev.12251; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08107.x; 10.1016/j.dhjo.2012.06.002; 10.1002/(SICI)1099-078X(199811)13:43.0.CO;2-R; 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-023688; 10.1080/10409280701610796a; 10.1002/aur.1904; 10.1037/cjbs2007001; 10.1136/jech.55.4.246; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01117.x; 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001544; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2014.02.011; 10.1002/ajmg.c.31440; 10.2105/AJPH.2014.302133; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.11.032; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.08.048; 10.1177/0009922815592607; 10.1136/jech.55.2.111; 10.23889/ijpds.v3i4.816; 10.1136/bmj.313.7060.784; 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01760; 10.1136/jech.57.9.699; 10.1080/00220973.2015.1027805; 10.1037/a0029416; 10.1080/14034940600551251; 10.1016/j.ssmph.2019.100520; 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a112268; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2014.2463; 10.1177/1362361311413397; 10.1093/aje/kwk052; 10.1016/j.ssmph.2019.100512; 10.1016/j.ssmph.2016.11.006","None.","Offord Centre for Child Studies, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West - MIP Suite 201A, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada."
"32985703","Parenting Stress During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Socioeconomic and Environmental Risk Factors and Implications for Children Emotion Regulation.","Maria Spinelli, Francesca Lionetti, Annalisa Setti, Mirco Fasolo","The COVID-19 outbreak imposed to Italian families many changes in their daily life increasing the risk of developing psychological problems. The present study explored risk factors associated with parenting stress and implications for children's emotion regulation in families with different socioeconomic risks. Parents of 2-14&#xa0;years old children completed a survey reporting difficulties experienced due to the lockdown, level of household chaos, parenting stress, parent involvement in the child's daily life, and children emotion regulation competences. The general mean levels of parenting stress and children emotion regulation abilities were not at clinical level compared with Italian norms. Household chaos predicted higher levels of parenting stress, which, in turn, was associated with less effective emotion regulation in children through the mediating role of parental involvement. More stressed parents were less involved in their children's activities, decreasing children's effective emotion regulation. Only for SES no-risk families, the lockdown constraints increased parenting stress. For SES at-risk families, the impact of parenting stress and involvement on children regulation strategies was stronger, with a protective role played by parental involvement on children's negativity not evident for SES no-risk families. Dealing with the lockdown is a stressful experience for parents who have to balance personal life, work, and children upbringing, without other help. This situation potentially impairs their ability to be supportive caregivers and is consequently detrimental for children well-being. Policies should take into consideration the implications of the lockdown for families' mental health and tailor supportive interventions according to family's risk factors. El brote de la COVID-19 impuso a las familias italianas muchos cambios en su vida cotidiana, los cuales aumentaron el riesgo de desarrollar problemas psicol&#xf3;gicos. El presente estudio analiz&#xf3; los factores de riesgo asociados con el estr&#xe9;s de la crianza y las consecuencias para la regulaci&#xf3;n emocional de los hijos en familias con diferentes riesgos socioecon&#xf3;micos. Un grupo de padres de ni&#xf1;os de entre dos y 14 a&#xf1;os contest&#xf3; una encuesta donde inform&#xf3; las dificultades vividas debido al confinamiento, el nivel de caos en el hogar, el estr&#xe9;s en la crianza, la participaci&#xf3;n de los padres en la vida diaria de los hijos y las competencias de los hijos para regular sus emociones. Los niveles promedio generales de estr&#xe9;s en la crianza y las habilidades de regulaci&#xf3;n emocional en los ni&#xf1;os no estuvieron a nivel cl&#xed;nico en comparaci&#xf3;n con las normas italianas. El caos en el hogar predijo niveles m&#xe1;s altos de estr&#xe9;s en la crianza, el cual, a su vez, estuvo asociado con una menor regulaci&#xf3;n emocional eficaz en los ni&#xf1;os mediante el rol mediador de la participaci&#xf3;n de los padres. Los padres m&#xe1;s estresados participaron menos en las actividades de sus hijos, lo cual disminuy&#xf3; la regulaci&#xf3;n emocional eficaz en los ni&#xf1;os. Solo en los casos de las familias sin riesgo socioecon&#xf3;mico las limitaciones del confinamiento aumentaron el estr&#xe9;s en la crianza. Para las familias de riesgo socioecon&#xf3;mico, el efecto del estr&#xe9;s en la crianza y la participaci&#xf3;n en las estrategias de regulaci&#xf3;n emocional de los ni&#xf1;os fue m&#xe1;s profundo, y en el caso de las familias sin riesgo socioecon&#xf3;mico, no se evidenci&#xf3; el papel protector desempe&#xf1;ado por la participaci&#xf3;n de los padres en la negatividad de los ni&#xf1;os. Lidiar con el confinamiento es una experiencia estresante para los padres que tienen que compatibilizar la vida personal, el trabajo y la educaci&#xf3;n de los ni&#xf1;os sin ninguna otra ayuda. Esta situaci&#xf3;n puede deteriorar su capacidad de ser cuidadores comprensivos y, como consecuencia, ser perjudicial para el bienestar de los ni&#xf1;os. Las pol&#xed;ticas deber&#xed;an tener en cuenta las consecuencias del confinamiento en la salud mental de las familias y adaptar intervenciones de apoyo de acuerdo con los factores de riesgo de las familias. &#x65b0;&#x51a0;&#x80ba;&#x708e;&#x75ab;&#x60c5;&#x7ed9;&#x610f;&#x5927;&#x5229;&#x5bb6;&#x5ead;&#x7684;&#x65e5;&#x5e38;&#x751f;&#x6d3b;&#x5e26;&#x6765;&#x8bb8;&#x591a;&#x53d8;&#x5316;&#xff0c;&#x589e;&#x52a0;&#x4e86;&#x51fa;&#x73b0;&#x5fc3;&#x7406;&#x95ee;&#x9898;&#x7684;&#x98ce;&#x9669;&#x3002;&#x672c;&#x7814;&#x7a76;&#x63a2;&#x8ba8;&#x4e0d;&#x540c;&#x793e;&#x4f1a;&#x7ecf;&#x6d4e;&#x98ce;&#x9669;&#x5bb6;&#x5ead;&#x4e2d;&#xff0c;&#x4e0e;&#x7236;&#x6bcd;&#x538b;&#x529b;&#x76f8;&#x5173;&#x7684;&#x98ce;&#x9669;&#x56e0;&#x7d20;&#x53ca;&#x5b83;&#x4eec;&#x5bf9;&#x513f;&#x7ae5;&#x60c5;&#x7eea;&#x8c03;&#x8282;&#x7684;&#x5f71;&#x54cd;&#x3002;2&#x81f3;14&#x5c81;&#x513f;&#x7ae5;&#x7684;&#x7236;&#x6bcd;&#x5b8c;&#x6210;&#x4e86;&#x4e00;&#x9879;&#x8c03;&#x67e5;&#xff0c;&#x62a5;&#x544a;&#x4e86;&#x7531;&#x4e8e;&#x7981;&#x95ed;&#x3001;&#x5bb6;&#x5ead;&#x6df7;&#x4e71;&#x7a0b;&#x5ea6;&#x3001;&#x7236;&#x6bcd;&#x538b;&#x529b;&#x3001;&#x7236;&#x6bcd;&#x53c2;&#x4e0e;&#x513f;&#x7ae5;&#x65e5;&#x5e38;&#x751f;&#x6d3b;&#x548c;&#x513f;&#x7ae5;&#x60c5;&#x7eea;&#x8c03;&#x8282;&#x80fd;&#x529b;&#x6240;&#x7ecf;&#x5386;&#x7684;&#x56f0;&#x5883;&#x3002;&#x4e0e;&#x610f;&#x5927;&#x5229;&#x6807;&#x51c6;&#x76f8;&#x6bd4;&#xff0c;&#x517b;&#x80b2;&#x538b;&#x529b;&#x548c;&#x513f;&#x7ae5;&#x60c5;&#x7eea;&#x8c03;&#x8282;&#x80fd;&#x529b;&#x7684;&#x4e00;&#x822c;&#x5e73;&#x5747;&#x6c34;&#x5e73;&#x6ca1;&#x6709;&#x8fbe;&#x5230;&#x4e34;&#x5e8a;&#x6c34;&#x5e73;&#x3002;&#x5bb6;&#x5ead;&#x6df7;&#x4e71;&#x9884;&#x793a;&#x7740;&#x66f4;&#x9ad8;&#x7a0b;&#x5ea6;&#x7684;&#x7236;&#x6bcd;&#x538b;&#x529b;&#xff0c;&#x53cd;&#x8fc7;&#x6765;&#xff0c;&#x901a;&#x8fc7;&#x7236;&#x6bcd;&#x53c2;&#x4e0e;&#x7684;&#x4e2d;&#x4ecb;&#x4f5c;&#x7528;&#xff0c;&#x5b69;&#x5b50;&#x7684;&#x60c5;&#x7eea;&#x8c03;&#x8282;&#x80fd;&#x529b;&#x66f4;&#x4f4e;&#x3002;&#x7236;&#x6bcd;&#x538b;&#x529b;&#x8d8a;&#x5927;&#xff0c;&#x53c2;&#x4e0e;&#x5b69;&#x5b50;&#x6d3b;&#x52a8;&#x5c31;&#x8d8a;&#x5c11;&#xff0c;&#x5b69;&#x5b50;&#x6709;&#x6548;&#x60c5;&#x7eea;&#x8c03;&#x8282;&#x80fd;&#x529b;&#x5c31;&#x8d8a;&#x5f31;&#x3002;&#x53ea;&#x6709;&#x5bf9;&#x6ca1;&#x6709;&#x793e;&#x4f1a;&#x7ecf;&#x6d4e;&#x5730;&#x4f4d;&#x98ce;&#x9669;&#x7684;&#x5bb6;&#x5ead;&#x6765;&#x8bf4;&#xff0c;&#x7981;&#x95ed;&#x624d;&#x4f1a;&#x589e;&#x52a0;&#x517b;&#x80b2;&#x5b50;&#x5973;&#x7684;&#x538b;&#x529b;&#x3002;&#x5728;&#x6709;&#x793e;&#x4f1a;&#x7ecf;&#x6d4e;&#x5730;&#x4f4d;&#x98ce;&#x9669;&#x7684;&#x5bb6;&#x5ead;&#x4e2d;&#xff0c;&#x7236;&#x6bcd;&#x7684;&#x538b;&#x529b;&#x548c;&#x53c2;&#x4e0e;&#x5bf9;&#x513f;&#x7ae5;&#x8c03;&#x8282;&#x7b56;&#x7565;&#x7684;&#x5f71;&#x54cd;&#x66f4;&#x5927;&#xff0c;&#x800c;&#x7236;&#x6bcd;&#x53c2;&#x4e0e;&#x5bf9;&#x513f;&#x7ae5;&#x6d88;&#x6781;&#x60c5;&#x7eea;&#x7684;&#x4fdd;&#x62a4;&#x4f5c;&#x7528;&#x5728;&#x6ca1;&#x6709;&#x793e;&#x4f1a;&#x7ecf;&#x6d4e;&#x5730;&#x4f4d;&#x98ce;&#x9669;&#x7684;&#x5bb6;&#x5ead;&#x4e2d;&#x5e76;&#x4e0d;&#x660e;&#x663e;&#x3002; &#x5bf9;&#x4e8e;&#x90a3;&#x4e9b;&#x4e0d;&#x5f97;&#x4e0d;&#x5728;&#x6ca1;&#x6709;&#x5176;&#x4ed6;&#x5e2e;&#x52a9;&#x7684;&#x60c5;&#x51b5;&#x4e0b;&#x5e73;&#x8861;&#x4e2a;&#x4eba;&#x751f;&#x6d3b;&#x3001;&#x5de5;&#x4f5c;&#x548c;&#x629a;&#x517b;&#x5b69;&#x5b50;&#x7684;&#x7236;&#x6bcd;&#x6765;&#x8bf4;&#xff0c;&#x5e94;&#x5bf9;&#x7981;&#x95ed;&#x662f;&#x4e00;&#x4ef6;&#x5f88;&#x6709;&#x538b;&#x529b;&#x7684;&#x4e8b;&#x60c5;&#x3002;&#x8fd9;&#x79cd;&#x60c5;&#x51b5;&#x53ef;&#x80fd;&#x635f;&#x5bb3;&#x4ed6;&#x4eec;&#x6210;&#x4e3a;&#x652f;&#x6301;&#x6027;&#x7167;&#x987e;&#x8005;&#x7684;&#x80fd;&#x529b;&#xff0c;&#x56e0;&#x6b64;&#x5bf9;&#x513f;&#x7ae5;&#x7684;&#x798f;&#x7949;&#x6709;&#x5bb3;&#x3002;&#x653f;&#x7b56;&#x5e94;&#x8003;&#x8651;&#x5230;&#x5c01;&#x9501;&#x5bf9;&#x5bb6;&#x5ead;&#x5fc3;&#x7406;&#x5065;&#x5eb7;&#x7684;&#x5f71;&#x54cd;&#xff0c;&#x5e76;&#x6839;&#x636e;&#x5bb6;&#x5ead;&#x7684;&#x98ce;&#x9669;&#x56e0;&#x7d20;&#x5236;&#x5b9a;&#x652f;&#x6301;&#x6027;&#x5e72;&#x9884;&#x63aa;&#x65bd;&#x3002;.",2021,6,1,"Family process","10.1111/famp.12601",NA,"Fam Process","eng","D000293; D000328; D000086382; D017028; D002648; D002675; D000080103; D006801; D008297; D008603; D010287; D016487; D010290; D013315","Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19; Caregivers; Child; Child, Preschool; Emotional Regulation; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Parent-Child Relations; Parenting; Parents; Stress, Psychological",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Neurosciences Imaging and Clinical Sciences, University G.

An enduring question, however, is whether these associations are causal. Genetic confounding could occur due to downward mobility of individuals at high genetic risk for psychiatric problems into disadvantaged environments. We examined correlations of five indices of genetic risk [polygenic risk scores (PRS) for schizophrenia and depression, maternal psychotic symptoms, family psychiatric history, and zygosity-based latent genetic risk] with multiple area-, neighborhood-, and family-level risks during upbringing. Data were from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally-representative cohort of 2232 British twins born in 1994-1995 and followed to age 18 (93% retention). Socioenvironmental risks included urbanicity, air pollution, neighborhood deprivation, neighborhood crime, neighborhood disorder, social cohesion, residential mobility, family poverty, and a cumulative environmental risk scale. At age 18, participants were privately interviewed about psychotic experiences. Higher genetic risk on all indices was associated with riskier environments during upbringing. For example, participants with higher schizophrenia PRS (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.06-1.33), depression PRS (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.08-1.34), family history (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.11-1.40), and latent genetic risk (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.07-1.38) had accumulated more socioenvironmental risks for schizophrenia by age 18. However, associations between socioenvironmental risks and psychotic experiences mostly remained significant after covariate adjustment for genetic risk. Genetic risk is correlated with socioenvironmental risk for schizophrenia during upbringing, but the associations between socioenvironmental risk and adolescent psychotic experiences appear, at present, to exist above and beyond this gene-environment correlation.",2022,6,1,"Psychological medicine","10.1017/S0033291720003347","PMC9226384","Psychol Med","eng","D000293; D006801; D008137; D011618; D012111; D012559; D012931; D006113","Adolescent; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Psychotic Disorders; Residence Characteristics; Schizophrenia; Social Environment; United Kingdom","G1002190; MR/P005918/1; NE/P010687/1; 204823/Z/16/Z; 218632/Z/19/Z","10.1016/j.neubiorev.2018.06.002; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10040567; 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.05.034; 10.1038/s41562-019-0562-1; 10.1016/j.schres.2014.03.014; 10.1037/a0023194; 10.1111/1467-9280.00267; 10.1186/s13742-015-0047-8; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.1581; 10.1038/nature16030; 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003348; 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu848; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2017.02.492; 10.1038/nature15393; 10.1176/ajp.155.9.1196; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.14401; 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62036-X; 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000529; 10.1093/schbul/sbs151; 10.1038/nature10190; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.2508; 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60072-6; 10.1016/j.schres.2011.03.029; 10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.03.004; 10.1017/S0033291708003115; 10.1111/1469-7610.00082; 10.1056/nejm199902253400803; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.0056; 10.1017/S0954579417001420; 10.1093/schbul/sbw052; 10.1093/schbul/sbx060; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2012.02565.x; 10.1017/S0954579412000326; 10.1037/a0016162; 10.1007/s00127-016-1233-4; 10.1002/ajmg.b.32630; 10.1017/S0033291717001696; 10.1038/s41588-018-0059-2; 10.1192/bjp.179.1.46; 10.1001/archpsyc.58.11.1039; 10.1038/nrg2670; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.14; 10.1001/archpsyc.57.11.1053; 10.1038/nature13595; 10.1038/tp.2016.62; 10.1093/nar/29.1.308; 10.1093/schbul/sbz049; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2004.04.003; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2006.00857.x; 10.1017/S0033291708003814; 10.1093/schbul/sbn101; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2016.06.028; 10.1093/schbul/sbs096; 10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.06.005; 10.1038/s41588-018-0090-3; 10.1038/ejhg.2009.177; 10.1097/01.chi.0000126937.44875.6b; 10.1080/00048670802607188","None.","King's College London, Social, Genetic &amp; Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience, London, UK."
"32967067","Genes and environments, development and time.","W Thomas Boyce, Marla B Sokolowski, Gene E Robinson","A now substantial body of science implicates a dynamic interplay between genetic and environmental variation in the development of individual differences in behavior and health. Such outcomes are affected by molecular, often epigenetic, processes involving gene-environment (G-E) interplay that can influence gene expression. Early environments with exposures to poverty, chronic adversities, and acutely stressful events have been linked to maladaptive development and compromised health and behavior. Genetic differences can impart either enhanced or blunted susceptibility to the effects of such pathogenic environments. However, largely missing from present discourse regarding G-E interplay is the role of time, a ""third factor"" guiding the emergence of complex developmental endpoints across different scales of time. Trajectories of development increasingly appear best accounted for by a complex, dynamic interchange among the highly linked elements of genes, contexts, and time at multiple scales, including neurobiological (minutes to milliseconds), genomic (hours to minutes), developmental (years and months), and evolutionary (centuries and millennia) time. This special issue of PNAS thus explores time and timing among G-E transactions: The importance of timing and timescales in plasticity and critical periods of brain development; epigenetics and the molecular underpinnings of biologically embedded experience; the encoding of experience across time and biological levels of organization; and gene-regulatory networks in behavior and development and their linkages to neuronal networks. Taken together, the collection of papers offers perspectives on how G-E interplay operates contingently within and against a backdrop of time and timescales.",2020,9,22,"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","10.1073/pnas.2016710117","PMC7519332","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","eng","D000818; D005075; D044127; D005786; D059647; D006801; D013995","Animals; Biological Evolution; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene-Environment Interaction; Humans; Time",NA,"NA","The authors declare no competing interest.","Program in Child and Brain Development, Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, Toronto, ON M5G 1M1, Canada."
"32948549","Role of cumulative biological risk in mediating socioeconomic disparities in cognitive function in the elderly: a mediation analysis.","Jimmy Akrivos, Carolyn Wei Zhu, Vahram Haroutunian","To evaluate whether allostatic load (AL), a measure of cumulative biological risk, fully or partially mediates observed socioeconomic status (SES) differences in cognitive function in the elderly. Cross-sectional mediation analysis. Community-dwelling US elderly who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The NHANES uses a complex, multistage, probability sampling design to select a nationally representative sample. Of the 4976 elderly (60 years or older) who were selected, 3234 agreed to participate in the household and medical exam interviews (65% response rate). Performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)-a measure of cognitive function. Relative to participants with the lowest level of education or family income, participants who were college graduates (&#x3b2;=24.4, 95%&#x2009;CI 22 to 26.8, p&lt;0.0001) or in the highest income quartile (&#x3b2;=17.3, 95%&#x2009;CI 15.2 to 19.4, p&lt;0.0001) had the highest DSST scores and the least AL burden (&#x3b2;=-0.72, 95%&#x2009;CI -0.98 to -0.47 and &#x3b2;=-0.82, 95%&#x2009;CI -1 to -0.57; p&lt;0.0001, respectively). Although, AL was significantly negatively associated with cognitive performance (&#x3b2; = -1, 95%&#x2009;CI -1.4 to -0.5, p&lt;0.0001), it mediated at most 4.5% of the SES effect on DSST performance.

This study aims to unravel changes in household poverty levels among people with SMI in a fast-changing rural community in China. Two mental health surveys, using ICD-10, were conducted in the same six townships of Xinjin county, Chengdu, China. A total of 711 and 1042 people with SMI identified in 1994 and 2015, respectively, participated in the study. The Foster-Greer-Thorbecke poverty index was adopted to measure the changes in household poverty. These changes were decomposed into effects of growth and equity using a static decomposition method. Factors associated with household poverty in 1994 and 2015 were examined and compared by regression analyses. The proportion of poor households, as measured by the headcount ratio, increased significantly from 29.8% in 1994 to 39.5% in 2015. Decomposition showed that poverty in households containing people with SMI had worsened because of a redistribution effect. Factors associated with household poverty had also changed during the study period. The patient's age, ability to work and family size were of paramount significance in 2015. This study shows that the levels of poverty faced by households containing people with SMI has become more pressing with China's fast socioeconomic development. It calls for further integration of mental health recovery and targeted antipoverty interventions for people with SMI as a development priority.",2020,9,17,"BJPsych open","10.1192/bjo.2020.95","PMC7576660","BJPsych Open","eng",NA,NA,"MR/R023697/1","NA","None.

"32937888","Betel Quid Health Risks of Insulin Resistance Diseases in Poor Young South Asian Native and Immigrant Populations.","Suzanne M de la Monte, Natalia Moriel, Amy Lin, Nada Abdullah Tanoukhy, Camille Homans, Gina Gallucci, Ming Tong, Ayumi Saito","Betel quid, traditionally prepared with areca nut, betel leaf, and slaked lime, has been consumed for thousands of years, mainly in the form of chewing. Originally used for cultural, medicinal, and ceremonial purposes mainly in South Asian countries, its use has recently spread across the globe due to its psychoactive, euphoric, and aphrodisiac properties. Now it is widely used as a social lubricant and source of financial profit. Unfortunately, the profit motive has led to high rates of habitual consumption with eventual conversion to addiction among young girls and boys. Moreover, the worrisome practice of including tobacco in quid preparations has grown, particularly among pregnant women. Major health concerns include increased rates of malignancy, oral pathology, and cardiovascular, hepatic, fertility, metabolic, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Metabolic disorders and insulin resistance disease states such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome contribute to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, the constituents of areca nut/betel quid are metabolized to N-nitroso compounds, i.e., nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic at high doses and cause insulin resistance following chronic low-level exposures. From an epidemiological perspective, the rising tide of insulin resistance diseases including obesity, diabetes, and dementias that now disproportionately burden poor countries has been propagated by rapid commercialization and enhanced access to betel quid. Public health measures are needed to impose socially and ethically responsible barriers to yet another cause of global health disparity.",2020,9,14,"International journal of environmental research and public health","10.3390/ijerph17186690","PMC7558723","Int J Environ Res Public Health","eng","D001114; D044466; D003924; D054242; D005260; D054624; D006801; D007333; D008297; D011203; D011247; D055815","Areca; Asian People; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Male; Poverty; Pregnancy; Young Adult","R01 AA011431; R01 AA028408; R37 11431","10.1016/j.pcad.2015.08.010; 10.3233/JAD-2009-1098; 10.1007/s13105-016-0465-9; 10.1007/BF02860022; 10.1016/S0190-9622(98)70543-2; 10.1080/13556210020091437; 10.1080/13556210120091446; 10.1080/13556210120091473; 10.1080/13556210120091509; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.02952.x; 10.1016/j.jep.2015.02.010; 10.1016/0006-8993(77)90075-0; 10.1002/hed.23130; 10.1097/WNR.0000000000001172; 10.1046/j.1440-1754.2002.00040.x; 10.1590/S0042-96862005000900010; 10.3758/s13414-011-0214-7; 10.1016/S0009-9236(96)90054-5; 10.1001/archpsyc.1988.01800340023003; 10.1006/nlme.1997.3786; 10.1192/bjp.138.1.46; 10.1006/nlme.1995.1017; 10.1016/0893-133X(95)00179-H; 10.1007/BF02244889; 10.1007/s00213-016-4331-9; 10.1371/journal.pone.0023874; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.06.039; 10.1080/01635589409514333; 10.1038/bjc.1984.210; 10.1046/j.1440-1843.2003.00507.x; 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000201)88:3&lt;664::AID-CNCR25&gt;3.0.CO;2-V; 10.1111/j.1600-0722.1980.tb01221.x; 10.1080/13556210120091518; 10.1080/13556210120091536; 10.1016/S1470-2045(03)01229-4; 10.4103/1947-2714.163648; 10.1021/acs.jafc.6b05140; 10.4103/0976-237X.96817; 10.1136/bmj.324.7341.799; 10.1186/1617-9625-1-2-111; 10.4103/0970-9290.30915; 10.1111/j.1600-0714.1996.tb00209.x; 10.1300/J500v04n01_07; 10.1007/s10903-007-9041-2; 10.1006/pmed.1999.0560; 10.2427/5709; 10.1080/10826084.2016.1246572; 10.2190/DE.39.1.e; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2010.07.018; 10.1177/2229411220140205; 10.1016/j.jobcr.2016.10.008; 10.1186/s12889-017-4916-1; 10.1111/j.1600-0528.1993.tb01101.x; 10.1034/j.1600-0528.2000.028002150.x; 10.1080/13556210050003766; 10.1186/1747-597X-6-23; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.03.016; 10.5005/jp-journals-10001-1003; 10.1080/13556210120091482; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.05.020; 10.1291/hypres.31.417; 10.1093/ajcn/87.1.70; 10.4103/0971-5851.133702; 10.1177/1403494810379291; 10.1007/s00127-017-1460-3; 10.1136/adc.88.12.1086; 10.1016/S0892-0362(00)00096-9; 10.1136/thx.53.5.381; 10.1136/thx.53.4.295; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2009.06.021; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.01.003; 10.1016/j.medcli.2018.03.022; 10.1016/j.inhe.2012.05.001; 10.1186/s12884-015-0615-z; 10.1007/s10995-016-1972-6; 10.1080/13556210120091455; 10.1016/0306-3623(93)90224-L; 10.1016/0022-510X(90)90099-9; 10.1139/Y10-024; 10.1038/258627a0; 10.1111/j.1600-0714.2009.00881.x; 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-0483; 10.1002/rcm.3137; 10.1021/tx0600402; 10.1002/dta.1912; 10.1093/jat/bkv077; 10.15713/ins.jcri.153; 10.1002/1097-0142(19920901)70:5&lt;1017::AID-CNCR2820700502&gt;3.0.CO;2-#; 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(20000401)86:1&lt;128::AID-IJC20&gt;3.0.CO;2-M; 10.1054/bjoc.2001.1927; 10.1111/j.1600-0714.2006.00431.x; 10.1093/jat/21.4.310; 10.1111/j.1651-2227.1990.tb11430.x; 10.1038/383713a0; 10.1254/jphs.14R03CP; 10.3109/00498259409043240; 10.1073/pnas.220207697; 10.1093/carcin/9.6.875; 10.1093/carcin/12.2.299; 10.1007/BF01830261; 10.1002/jcb.240531005; 10.1186/1476-9255-9-22; 10.1097/MAJ.0b013e31827333fb; 10.5005/jp-journals-10024-1922; 10.7314/APJCP.2015.16.10.4429; 10.1046/j.1365-263x.2001.00235.x; 10.4066/AMJ.2010.280; 10.1007/BF00428777; 10.1080/13556210120091464; 10.1093/ajcn/83.6.1313; 10.1007/s10565-011-9195-5; 10.1002/jmri.25322; 10.1097/MAJ.0b013e31823650a7; 10.1080/00016350802286725; 10.1017/S0007114500000349; 10.1007/s00125-004-1532-2; 10.1371/journal.pone.0070679; 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.021511; 10.1093/ajcn/83.5.1153; 10.1155/2013/409083; 10.1038/oby.2009.38; 10.1080/13813455.2017.1420665; 10.1038/nrneurol.2017.185; 10.2174/1568026617666170103163403; 10.1590/1980-57642015DN92000003; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2006.03.003; 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2014.06.008; 10.1016/j.ecl.2013.09.006; 10.1016/j.esxm.2017.05.002; 10.1186/s12967-016-0784-1; 10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00139; 10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00201; 10.3109/13880209.2016.1160251; 10.1093/carcin/22.9.1527; 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2010.07.017; 10.1002/bdra.10136; 10.4196/kjpp.2014.18.2.143; 10.1002/ijc.2910470315; 10.21010/ajtcam.v14i3.4; 10.4103/0973-029X.125203; 10.1007/s007840000077; 10.1177/154411130201300208; 10.1046/j.1365-2842.2000.00578.x; 10.1186/1475-2891-11-79; 10.5005/johcd-8-2-79","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","Department of Epidemiology in the School of Public Health, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, USA."

Findings from the Constances cohort.","J Matta, N Hoertel, G Airagnes, E Wiernik, F Limosin, M Goldberg, M Zins, C Lemogne","The role of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use in social differences in terms of depression is poorly understood. We have applied mediation and moderated-mediation models stratified by gender to a population-based sample (N&#x202f;=&#x202f;37,192) of French men and women from the Constances cohort with baseline and follow-up measures of depressive states. We have examined whether socioeconomic status (SES, measured by education and income) differences in the prevalence of depressive states may be explained by both differences in prevalence of substance use according to SES (mediating effects) and differential effects of substance use on depressive state according to SES (moderating effects). In the mediation models, substance use only explained 5.3% and 2.4% of the association between low education and depressive state in men and women respectively, and was not a significant mediator for income. Moderated mediation models showed robust moderation effects of education and income in both men and women. The association of tobacco use with depressive symptoms, which was the only substance for which a mediation effect remained and for which the moderation effect of SES was the strongest, was significantly higher in participants with low SES. The partially cross-sectional nature of the data restricts the possibility of drawing causality with regards to associations between SES and substance use.

Infant-mother dyads (n = 109) were recruited in Boston and Los Angeles community pediatric practices. Infant cognition was measured using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning when the infant was aged 2, 6, 9, and 12 months. Longitudinal linear mixed effects modeling and linear regression models explored potential predictors of cognitive outcomes. Cognitive scores were lower than the reference population mean at both 6 and 12 months. There were site differences in demographics and cognitive performance.

Decreased access to health care and low socioeconomic status (SES) worsen the adverse effects of biologic or genetic predisposition to CKD. All the studies used were retrieved using the PubMed database. The literature suggests that in developing and developed countries, lower SES is inversely proportional to CKD. It shows an inconsistent relationship between CKD and race; that is, there may or may not be a relationship between these two variables. In the United States (US), the prevalence of the early stages of CKD is similar across different racial/ethnic groups. However, the preponderance of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is higher for minorities than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Further investigation is required to understand the role of racial disparities and CKD as well as to understand the significant difference seen in the incidence when progressing from CKD to ESRD. It is necessary to recognize how lower SES and racial/ethnic disparity may result in the impediment of appropriate disease management. A possible approach is the use of the biopsychosocial model, which integrates biological, individual, and neighborhood factors. A practical method of providing appropriate care to these populations will require economically feasible prevention strategies as well as extending the scope of dialysis by the implementation of cheaper alternatives.",2020,7,31,"Cureus","10.7759/cureus.9499","PMC7458706","Cureus","eng",NA,NA,NA,"NA","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Internal Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences &amp; Psychology, Fairfield, USA."

This was an exploratory study which sought to examine low-income women's perceptions of mental illness and its management in the context of urban poverty in India. This research was prompted by the lack of empirical studies documenting how women in marginalized sections of society understand mental illness. Data were collected through a combination of 10 focus group discussions and two individual interviews with a total of 63 women residing in low-income areas of Mumbai. Social representations theory was used to explore shared meanings of mental illness among women in this setting. Thematic analysis of the data showed that women use the expression ""tension"" to talk about mental illness. Tension was described both as an ordinary part of life and a condition having its origins in more profound gender-related stressors, particularly pressures surrounding motherhood, chronic poverty and domestic conflict. Approaches to managing tension were pluralistic and focused on the resumption of social roles. Findings are consistent with other studies in similar cultural contexts, suggesting a shared, transnational character to women's distress and the need for scholarship on women's mental health in low-income settings to be more attuned to gendered forms of marginalization.",2021,6,1,"Transcultural psychiatry","10.1177/1363461520947836","PMC8060732","Transcult Psychiatry","eng","D005260; D006801; D007194; D001523; D008603; D011203; D016387","Female; Humans; India; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Poverty; Women's Health",NA,"NA","<b>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</b> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect tothe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.","Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London."

The goal of this study is to report the associations of COVID-19 with respect to race, health, and economic inequality in the United States. We performed an ecological study of the associations between infection and mortality rate of COVID-19 and demographic, socioeconomic, and mobility variables from 369 counties (total population, 102,178,117 [median, 73,447; IQR, 30,761-256,098]) from the seven most affected states (Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Louisiana, Massachusetts). The risk factors for infection and mortality are different. Our analysis shows that counties with more diverse demographics, higher population, education, income levels, and lower disability rates were at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. However, counties with higher proportion with disability and poverty rates had a higher death rate. African Americans were more vulnerable to COVID-19 than other ethnic groups (1981 African American infected cases versus 658 Whites per million). Data on mobility changes corroborate the impact of social distancing. Our study provides evidence of racial, economic, and health inequality in the population infected by and dying from COVID-19. These observations might be due to the workforce of essential services, poverty, and access to care. Counties in more urban areas are probably better equipped at providing care. The lower rate of infection, but a higher death rate in counties with higher poverty and disability could be due to lower levels of mobility, but a higher rate of comorbidities and health care access.",2021,6,1,"Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities","10.1007/s40615-020-00833-4","PMC7462354","J Racial Ethn Health Disparities","eng","D000086382; D005260; D054624; D006801; D008297; D044469; D012307; D012959; D014481","COVID-19; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Male; Racial Groups; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; United States","R56 HL116832; R56HL116832","10.7861/clinmed.2019-coron; 10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102433; 10.2105/AJPH.2009.188029; 10.5455/msm.2015.27.409-411; 10.1186/s12913-015-1053-3; 10.1016/j.jpubeco.2018.06.011; 10.1016/j.dhjo.2010.05.003; 10.1016/j.phr.2004.05.006; 10.1177/1367493510387951; 10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.10.083; 10.1016/j.puhe.2018.01.030; 10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.03.054; 10.1007/s40615-016-0335-8","The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.","Geisinger Neuroscience Institute, Geisinger Health System, Danville, PA, USA."

A case-control study was done. 94 women were divided in groups using the trimesters of pregnancy as a criterion: each trimester, 1st, 2nd and 3rd had 17, 37 and 38 women, respectively. A control group of non-pregnant women (n-39) was also included. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed using the HAMA Scale and Beck Inventory, respectively. The thiamine and its phosphorylated derivatives concentrations were determined in whole blood samples using the HPLC method.

While early childhood is a crucial time for early intervention, it is characterized by instability of ADHD diagnosis. Neural correlates of ADHD have potential to improve diagnostic accuracy; however, minimal research has focused on early childhood. Research indicates that disrupted neural connectivity is associated with ADHD in older children. Here, we explore network connectivity as a potential neural correlate of ADHD diagnosis in early childhood.<b>Method:</b> We collected EEG data in 52 medication-na&#xef;ve children with ADHD and in 77 typically developing controls (3-7&#xa0;years). Data was collected with the EGI 128 HydroCel Sensor Net System, but to optimize the ICA, the data was down sampled to the 10-10 system. Connectivity was measured as the synchronization of the time series of each pair of electrodes. Subsequent analyses utilized graph theoretical methods to further characterize network connectivity.<b>Results:</b> Increased global efficiency, which measures the efficiency of information transfer across the entire brain, was associated with increased inattentive symptom severity. Further, this association was robust to controls for age, IQ, SES, and internalizing psychopathology.<b>Conclusions:</b> Overall, our findings indicate that increased global efficiency, which suggests a hyper-connected neural network, is associated with elevated ADHD symptom severity.

However, how they affect the brain in patients with psychosis remains unclear. We studied how environmental factors are related to brain structure in patients with schizophrenia and controls in Latin America, where these factors are large and unequally distributed. This is a multicentre study of magnetic resonance imaging in patients with schizophrenia and controls from six Latin American cities. Total and voxel-level grey matter volumes, and their relationship with neighbourhood characteristics such as average income and homicide rates, were analysed with a general linear model. A total of 334 patients with schizophrenia and 262 controls were included. Income was differentially related to total grey matter volume in both groups (P = 0.006). Controls showed a positive correlation between total grey matter volume and income (R = 0.14, P = 0.02). Surprisingly, this relationship was not present in patients with schizophrenia (R = -0.076, P = 0.17). Voxel-level analysis confirmed that this interaction was widespread across the cortex. After adjusting for global brain changes, income was positively related to prefrontal cortex volumes only in controls. Conversely, the hippocampus in patients with schizophrenia, but not in controls, was relatively larger in affluent environments.

The elderly, immunocompromised, and those with preexisting conditions-such as asthma, cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), or obesity-experience higher risk of becoming severely ill if infected with the virus. Systemic social inequality and discrepancies in socioeconomic status (SES) contribute to higher incidence of asthma, CVD, hypertension, CKD, and obesity in segments of the general population. Such preexisting conditions bring heightened risk of complications for individuals who contract the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from the virus (2019-nCoV)-also known as ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2). In order to help vulnerable groups during times of a health emergency, focus must be placed at the root of the problem. Studying the social determinants of health (SDOH), and how they impact disadvantaged populations during times of crisis, will help governments to better manage health emergencies so that every individual has equal opportunity to staying healthy.

The disease is a serious public health problem, and is directly linked to social issues. We analyzed temporal trend variations in areas at risk for concomitant TB, and characterized the clinical and epidemiological profiles of cases in a hyperendemic municipality in the Amazon region of Brazil. This ecological study was performed in the municipality of Manaus, in northern Brazil. The population comprised cases with concomitant pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB, registered on the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN), between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2018. For risk cluster detection, spatial and spatiotemporal scanning statistical techniques were used. The Spatial Variation in Temporal Trends (SVTT) approach was used to detect and infer clusters for significantly different time trends. Between 2009 and 2018, 873 concomitant TB cases were registered in Manaus. By using purely spatial scanning statistics, we identified two risk clusters. The relative risk (RR) of the clusters was 2.21 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.57-2.88; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0031) and 2.03 (95% CI: 1.58-2.58; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0029). Using space-time scanning, we identified a risk cluster with an RR of 3.57 (95% CI: 2.84-4.41; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014), between 2017 and 2018.

Since there are risks associated with cannabis use, a social gradient in cannabis use may contribute to reproducing socioeconomic differences in life opportunities. The aim of this study was to assess the association between childhood SES and cannabis use among youth in Sweden. We used repeated cross-sectional data from three waves (2014-2016) of the Swedish national school survey among 11th graders. The analysis encompassed 9497 individuals in 668 school classes. Childhood SES was measured through parents' highest education, as reported by the students. Cannabis use was measured in terms of lifetime use and frequency of use. Data were analysed using multi-level mixed-effects Poisson regression. Adolescents with at least 1 parent with university/college education had 17% (incidence rate ratio 1.17, confidence interval 1.05, 1.30) higher risk of lifetime use of cannabis compared with those whose parents had no university/college education, adjusting for sex, SES of the school environment, academic orientation, truancy, risk assessment and parental permissiveness. Among life-time users of cannabis, risk for frequent cannabis use was 28% (incidence rate ratio 0.72, confidence interval 0.53, 0.97) lower for those with at least 1 parent with university or college education.

Negative cognitive schemas are associated with both CA exposure and psychotic symptoms, highlighting the possibility that cognitive schemas may be a key risk pathway. The purpose of this study was to determine whether negative cognitive schemas mediate the association between CA and specific attenuated psychotic symptoms in a large sample of clinical-high risk youth. Given the variability in experiences that encompass CA (eg, abuse, neglect and poverty) and attenuated psychotic symptoms (eg, suspiciousness and perceptual abnormalities), we also tested whether these associations differ by CA type (threat vs deprivation) and attenuated positive psychotic symptom domain. Data were collected from 531 clinical-high risk youth between 12 and 35&#x2009;years of age (mean&#xa0;=&#xa0;18.80, SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;4.21) who completed a clinical assessment that included the Structured Interview of Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS), Childhood Trauma and Abuse scale and questionnaires on cognitive schemas and depressive symptoms. No direct effects of threat or deprivation exposure on any of the psychotic symptom domains were found. However, there was a unique indirect effect of threat, but not deprivation, on delusional thinking and suspiciousness through negative cognitive schemas about others. Cognitive vulnerability in the form of negative schemas about others may be one mechanism linking childhood threat experiences and attenuated psychotic symptoms.

We aimed to estimate the treated incidence of NAPD in Chile, and variance by person, place and time. We used national register data from Chile including all people, 10-65 years, with the first episode of NAPD (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision: F20-F29) between 1 January 2005 and 29 August 2018. Denominators were estimated from Chilean National Census data. Our main outcome was treated incidence of NAPD and age group, sex, calendar year and regional-level population density, multidimensional poverty and latitude were exposures of interest. We identified 32 358 NAPD cases [12 136 (39.5%) women; median age-at-first-contact: 24 years (interquartile range 18-39 years)] during 171.1 million person-years [crude incidence: 18.9 per 100 000 person-years; 95% confidence interval (CI) 18.7-19.1]. Multilevel Poisson regression identified a strong age-sex interaction in incidence, with rates peaking in men (57.6 per 100 000 person-years; 95% CI 56.0-59.2) and women (29.5 per 100 000 person-years; 95% CI 28.4-30.7) between 15 and 19 years old. Rates also decreased (non-linearly) over time for women, but not men. We observed a non-linear association with multidimensional poverty and latitude, with the highest rates in the poorest regions and those immediately south of Santiago; no association with regional population density was observed.

Here, we tested whether acute sensitization of the skin with topical capsaicin can add the sustained phase to this noninvasive surrogate model of intraoperative pain. Altogether, 110 healthy volunteers (55 male and 55 female; 26 &#xb1; 5 years) participated in several experiments using the ""blunt blade"" (0.25 &#xd7; 4 mm) on normal skin (n = 36) and on skin pretreated by a high-concentration capsaicin patch (8%, Qutenza; n = 36). These data were compared with an experimental incision (n = 40) using quantitative and qualitative pain ratings by numerical rating scale and SES Pain Perception Scale descriptors. Capsaicin sensitization increased blade-induced pain magnitude and duration significantly (both P &lt; 0.05), but it failed to fully match the sustained duration of incisional pain. In normal skin, the SES pattern of pain qualities elicited by the blade matched incision in pain magnitude and pattern of pain descriptors. In capsaicin-treated skin, the blade acquired a significant facilitation only of the perceived heat pain component (P &lt; 0.001), but not of mechanical pain components. Thus, capsaicin morphed the descriptor pattern of the blade to become more capsaicin-like, which is probably explained best by peripheral sensitization of the TRPV1 receptor. Quantitative sensory testing in capsaicin-sensitized skin revealed hyperalgesia to heat and pressure stimuli, and loss of cold and cold pain sensitivity. These findings support our hypothesis that the blade models the early tissue-strain-related mechanical pain phase of surgical incisions.",2021,1,1,"Pain","10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002020",NA,"Pain","eng","D002211; D005260; D006358; D006801; D006930; D008297; D010146; D010147; D017288","Capsaicin; Female; Hot Temperature; Humans; Hyperalgesia; Male; Pain; Pain Measurement; Pain Threshold",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Neurophysiology, Mannheim Center for Translational Neurosciences, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Ruprecht Karls-University Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany."

This study investigated whether adversity exposure would differentiate clinical and healthy voice-hearers within the context of a 'three-hit' model of vulnerability and stress exposure. Samples of 57 clinical and 45 healthy voice-hearers were compared on the three 'hits': familial risk; adversity exposure in childhood and in adolescence/adulthood. Clinical voice-hearers showed greater familial risk than healthy voice-hearers, with more family members with a history of psychosis, but not with other mental disorders. The two groups did not differ in their exposure to adversity in childhood [sexual and non-sexual, victimisation; discrimination and socio-economic status (SES)]. Contrary to expectations, clinical voice-hearers did not differ from healthy voice-hearers in their exposure to victimisation (sexual/non-sexual) and discrimination in adolescence/adulthood, but reported more cannabis and substance misuse, and lower SES. The current study found no evidence that clinical and healthy voice-hearers differ in lifetime victimisation exposure, suggesting victimisation may be linked to the emergence of AVHs generally, rather than need-for-care.

Patients with OCD showed significantly higher levels of sexual excitation, inhibition due to threat of performance failure, and inhibition due to threat of performance consequences than the controls. In addition, the patients with more severe symptoms showed lower excitation than those with less severe symptoms, and those with higher perfectionism had stronger inhibition due to threat of performance failure than those with lower perfectionism.

Patients with epilepsy (PWE) can face considerable stigma in society, and there have been various studies that evaluate the knowledge and attitude of the population towards epilepsy. However, there was no study of this kind in Morocco. Our aim was thus to assess knowledge, attitudes, and traditional practices specifically among relatives and caregivers of PWE in our community, in order to better evaluate their educational needs. This cross-sectional and descriptive study was carried out over a year long period in the outpatient neurology clinic of the Mohammed 6 University Hospital, a tertiary referral center in Marrakesh, Morocco. The respondents were relatives of PWE (usually parents and siblings) or spouses who attended the outpatient clinic alongside them. The interviews were carried out by the same investigator at the outpatient clinic during patient's visits, face-to-face using Moroccan Arabic or Darija, with an 18-item questionnaire. Responses of 100 participants were analyzed. The mean age was 40&#x202f;years old and 5&#x202f;months. Sixty-six percent of the respondents were women, 50% of rural origin and 76 % lived in an urban area. Forty-one percent were illiterate, and 74% were of low income. Only 65% of the participants knew the Arabic term for epilepsy. For 48%, epilepsy was linked with witchcraft or demonic possession. Seventy-five percent of the respondents had at least one prior consultation to a traditional healer. Only 5% in our study knew the first-aid basics to apply in case of a seizure. Despite having a relative with epilepsy, our participants' knowledge was very poor. The level of education and income seem to be the two major contributing factors. Cultural beliefs and superstition are very pervasive, and the majority of our sample had already used traditional healing and alternative medicine.

Little is known whether the effect of changes in population-level alcohol consumption on harm rates differs by SES-groups. The aim of this study was to elucidate this issue by estimating the association between per capita alcohol consumption and SES-specific rates of alcohol-related mortality. Per capita alcohol consumption was proxied by Systembolaget's alcohol sales (litres 100% alcohol per capita 15+). Quarterly data on mortality and alcohol consumption spanned the period 1991Q1-2017Q4. We used two outcomes: (i) alcohol-specific mortality (deaths with an explicit alcohol diagnosis); and (ii) violent deaths. SES was measured by education. We used three educational groups: (i) low (&lt;10&#x2009;years); (ii): intermediate (10-12&#x2009;years); and (iii) high (13+ years). We applied error correction modelling to estimate the association between alcohol and alcohol-specific mortality, and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average-modelling to estimate the association between alcohol and violent deaths. The estimated associations between per capita consumption and the two outcomes were positive and statistically significant in the two groups with low and intermediate education, but not in the high education group. There was a significant gradient in the level of association between alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm by educational group; the association was stronger the lower the educational group.

Data were collected from residents aged over 30&#x2009;years (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;997) using standardized tools and clinical measures. We performed latent class analysis incrementally to extract homogeneous latent classes of individuals based on their responses to social and behavioural risk factors in the survey. Using structural equation models, we assessed the mediating effect of depression and anxiety, and social or behavioural risk factors, on management of high blood pressure and raised serum glucose levels. The prevalence of high blood pressure and blood glucose in the sample was 33 and 26% respectively. Latent class analysis found three clusters of risk factors. One had a predominance of behavioural characteristics, another of social risk factors and the third was a low risk group. Age, female sex, and marital status had an effect on high blood pressure and high glucose, though were mediated by mental health, social and behavioural risk factors. Interventions to improve the management of risk factors for CVD need to address social risk factors and be sensitive to the needs of population sub-groups that may require additional support to access health services. An integration of social and health services may be required to achieve this.",2020,7,8,"BMC cardiovascular disorders","10.1186/s12872-020-01595-x","PMC7346640","BMC Cardiovasc Disord","eng","D000328; D000368; D001007; D002318; D002391; D015897; D003430; D003863; D003920; D005260; D015438; D007722; D006306; D000082742; D006801; D006973; D007194; D008019; D008297; D008603; D008875; D015995; D065840; D018570; D040242; D064890","Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Cardiovascular Diseases; Catchment Area, Health; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Health Behavior; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Surveys; Heart Disease Risk Factors; Humans; Hypertension; India; Life Style; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Protective Factors; Risk Assessment; Risk Reduction Behavior; Social Determinants of Health","001; IND/CONT/G/16-17/74","NA","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia."

Furthermore it endeavors to gauge the impact of illness burden and that of the Greek recession on economic distress, while disentangling their contribution. In total, 190 key relatives of people with severe mental illness were recruited from community mental health services in the region of Attica. Relatives completed a self-reported questionnaire consisting of the Index of Personal Economic Distress, the Family Burden scale and the Family Rituals scale. Information on financial strategies for tackling recession and income loss due to the recession was also gleaned. Regarding economic distress, only 15% had frequent difficulty meeting routine financial demands in their household. The preponderant strategy was spending savings (56.8%). Income category and spending less on basic needs were the main predictors of economic distress.

Additionally, the moderating roles of socioeconomic status (SES) and ethnicity were explored. A total of 350 Asian American, Latino, and European American youth participated at two-year intervals in wave 1 (n&#xa0;= 316, M<sub>age</sub>&#xa0;= 16.40), wave 2 (n&#xa0;= 248 including 34 new participants to refresh the sample, M<sub>age</sub>&#xa0;= 18.31), and wave 3 (n&#xa0;= 180, M<sub>age</sub>&#xa0;= 20.29). Sleep duration (weekday and weekend) and variability in duration (nightly and weekday/weekend) were obtained from eight nights of wrist actigraphy. Subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a biomarker of systemic inflammation, were assayed from dried blood spots obtained from finger pricks. Multilevel models demonstrated that greater weekday/weekend sleep variability and worse sleep quality were associated with higher CRP; shorter weekend duration was associated with higher CRP only at younger ages. Shorter weekday duration was associated with higher CRP only among high-SES youth, whereas greater nightly variability was associated with higher CRP only among European American youth. Aspects of poor sleep may contribute to the rise of CRP during adolescents' transition to young adulthood, especially in earlier years.

Extensive research has demonstrated CRT to improve cognition and psychosocial functioning in people with different diagnoses, but randomised trials of evidenced therapy programmes are lacking for bipolar disorders. The Cognitive Remediation in Bipolar (CRiB) study aimed to determine whether an established CRT programme is feasible and acceptable for people with bipolar disorders. This proof-of-concept, single-blind randomised trial recruited participants aged 18-65 with bipolar disorder, not currently experiencing an episode. They were 1:1 block randomised to treatment-as-usual (TAU) with or without individual CRT for 12&#xa0;weeks. The partly computerised CRT programme (""CIRCuiTS"") was therapist-led and is evidence-based from trials in those with psychotic illnesses.

In this study, we aimed to understand women and healthcare workers' (HCWs) perspectives of antenatal depression, their treatment preferences and potential acceptability and feasibility of psychological interventions in the rural Ethiopian context. In-depth interviews were conducted with women who had previously scored above the locally validated cut-off (five or more) on the Patient Health Questionnaire during pregnancy (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8), primary healthcare workers (HCWs; nurses, midwives and health officers) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8) and community-based health extension workers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7). Translated interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Women expressed their distress largely through somatic complaints, such as a headache and feeling weak. Facility and community-based HCWs suspected antenatal depression when women reported reduced appetite, sleep problems, difficulty bonding with the baby, or if they refused to breast-feed or were poorly engaged with antenatal care. Both women and HCWs perceived depression as a reaction (""thinking too much"") to social adversities such as poverty, marital conflict, perinatal complications and losses. Depressive symptoms and social adversities were often attributed to spiritual causes. Women awaited God's will in isolation at home or talked to neighbours as coping mechanisms. HCWs' motivation to provide help, the availability of integrated primary mental health care and a culture among women of seeking advice were potential facilitators for acceptability of a psychological intervention. Fears of being seen publicly during pregnancy, domestic and farm workload and staff shortages in primary healthcare were potential barriers to acceptability of the intervention. Antenatal care providers such as midwives were considered best placed to deliver interventions, given their close interaction with women during pregnancy. Women and HCWs in rural Ethiopia linked depressive symptoms in pregnancy with social adversities, suggesting that interventions which help women cope with real-world difficulties may be acceptable.

"32547270","Racial Difference in the Relationship Between Health and Happiness in the United States.","Sharon Cobb, Arash Javanbakht, Ebrahim Khalifeh Soltani, Mohsen Bazargan, Shervin Assari","Although health is a prerequisite for happiness, the salience of health for maintaining happiness may be diminished for Blacks when compared to Whites, a phenomenon which can be explained by the Black-White mental health paradox and &#xfeff;minorities' &#xfeff;diminished &#xfeff;returns. To understand if Black and White adult Americans differ in the effects of self-rated health (SRH) on happiness. This cross-sectional study used data from the General Social Survey (GSS; 1972-2018), a nationally representative survey in the US. Our analytical sample included 42,201 Black and White adults. The independent variable was SRH. Happiness was the dependent variable. Sociodemographic factors were covariates. Race was the moderator. Logistic regression was used to analyze the data without and with interaction terms between race and SRH. Overall, good SRH was positively associated with happiness, however, there was a significant interaction between race/ethnicity and good SRH on the outcome (i.e.&#xa0;happiness) . This finding suggested that the boosting effect of good SRH on happiness is weaker for Black than White people. In the United States, due to a weaker concordance between good health and happiness, Blacks who have poor SRH are more likely to report happiness. At the same time, Whites who are healthy report happiness, however, Blacks who are healthy do not necessarily report happiness. Disjointed link between health and happiness may be due to different racial, ethnic, and cultural perceptions of physical health and happiness as well as salience of physical health as a component of happiness. This may be an adaptive response of Blacks to sociopolitical as well as health-related adversities over centuries as a result of the combination of oppression, injustice, and poverty.",2020,1,1,"Psychology research and behavior management","10.2147/PRBM.S248633","PMC7259486","Psychol Res Behav Manag","eng",NA,NA,"R25 MD007610; U54 MD007598","10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.2688; 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-0982; 10.1016/j.archger.2017.10.006; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.008; 10.1016/j.jeoa.2016.07.002; 10.1080/13557858.2017.1290216; 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2016.03.126; 10.1177/1557988318780844; 10.3390/healthcare6020037; 10.32892/jmri.179; 10.18865/ed.26.2.157; 10.3390/ijerph16101826; 10.3390/healthcare6010002; 10.3390/bs8110107; 10.3390/brainsci8090176; 10.3390/bs7030048; 10.1007/s11524-017-0217-3; 10.1007/s40615-016-0278-0; 10.1007/s40615-017-0426-1; 10.3390/brainsci8080140; 10.1007/s40615-015-0116-9; 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2009.00597.x; 10.3389/fpsyt.2016.00140; 10.1177/0022146519845069; 10.18865/ed.26.3.453; 10.12861/jrip.2015.27; 10.2105/AJPH.2008.143446; 10.15171/ijer.2019.14; 10.3390/jpm7040006; 10.15171/ijer.2017.02; 10.1007/s40615-017-0417-2; 10.1016/j.annepidem.2015.11.006; 10.1177/1557988315600064; 10.2105/AJPH.2004.060749; 10.1080/19485565.2014.937000; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.04.026; 10.15171/hpr.2019.17; 10.11648/j.ijbecs.20190502.12; 10.3390/brainsci8070122; 10.2307/2955359; 10.3390/ijerph16193641; 10.3390/jcm7050093; 10.1007/s40615-016-0239-7; 10.3390/brainsci8060108; 10.3390/brainsci8080139; 10.1111/sipr.12042; 10.15171/ijhpm.2017.90; 10.1007/s10903-014-0140-6; 10.1007/s11482-017-9517-8; 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2009.00598.x; 10.1097/NNR.0000000000000191; 10.1017/S0954579416000894; 10.1037/hea0000398; 10.1093/aje/kwq283; 10.1080/07399332.2017.1290099; 10.1177/0095798415597093; 10.1177/0361684316646716; 10.2105/AJPH.2015.302903; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.06.036; 10.1080/13696998.2019.1600525; 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2016-052934","The authors declare no conflict of interest in this work.","Department of Family Medicine, Charles R Drew University of Medicine and Science, Los Angeles, CA, USA."

In addition, Nepal has endured several traumatic events in recent decades but the impact on mental health has not been studied in clinical settings. This study explores trauma-related psychiatric disorders and their correlates. 100 patients with a history of trauma who visited the outpatient psychiatry clinic at a University hospital in Kathmandu were assessed. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview 2.1 (CIDI) was used to evaluate lifetime and current depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and lifetime post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Current PTSD was evaluated using PSTD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C). The median number of lifetime traumatic events was two. Natural disaster was the most common trauma type (84%) compared to other types of trauma. Rape was reported as the most traumatizing. Current PTSD was found in 15%, depression in 33% and GAD in 38% of the patients. The lifetime rates were PTSD 83%, depression 45% and GAD 40%. There was high comorbidity between the disorders. The 31 to 45 years age group, above high school education level and trauma types other than earthquake were independently associated with current PTSD. Marital status and upper socioeconomic status (SES) compared to upper-middle SES were independently associated with lifetime PTSD. Both lifetime and current depression rates were independently associated with the upper SES compared to upper-middle SES. Place of living, education above high school and lower-middle SES were significantly associated with lifetime and current GAD. PTSD, depression and GAD were prevalent in a trauma exposed patient population visiting a psychiatric clinic in Nepal. High rates of comorbidities and several risk factors were identified. Our findings highlight the need for addressing trauma related disorders in clinical settings in developing countries.",2020,1,1,"PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0234203","PMC7295578","PLoS One","eng","D000293; D000328; D001008; D015897; D003430; D003863; D005260; D006801; D008297; D008875; D009390; D012959; D013313; D014947; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nepal; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Wounds and Injuries; Young Adult",NA,"10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61414-717826169; 10.1097/YCO.0000000000000256; 10.1371/journal.pone.0189996; 10.1002/da.2271129356216; 10.1192/bjp.bp.116.188078; 10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30934-1; 10.1521/pdps.2014.42.3.459; 10.1097/JGP.0b013e31820d92e7; 10.1186/s13031-014-0030-5; 10.1371/journal.pone.0183223; 10.1371/journal.pone.0158113; 10.1186/s13033-017-0145-3; 10.1192/s205647400000088x; 10.1007/s00127-012-0539-0; 10.1017/S0033291717000708; 10.1186/s12888-016-0810-0; 10.1007/s00127-005-0943-9; 10.1001/jama.280.5.443; 10.1097/NMD.0b013e31802f5dac; 10.1176/appi.ajp.160.11.2032; 10.1001/jama.2009.1132; 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00734; 10.1007/s11013-010-9170-2; 10.1186/1744-859X-6-12; 10.1590/1516-4446-2017-0025; 10.1016/0022-3956(94)90036-1; 10.1177/136346159903600304; 10.1002/jts.2006216281252; 10.1056/NEJMra012941; 10.1080/20008198.2017.1353383; 10.1080/08039488.2020.1714724; 10.1037//0022-006x.70.4.961; 10.1007/s00127-003-0659-7; 10.1016/j.jad.2016.12.009; 10.1017/S2045796016001104; 10.1371/journal.pone.0222407; 10.1002/jts.22152; 10.1002/jts.21814; 10.1097/YCO.0000000000000167; 10.1111/j.1755-5949.2008.00049.x; 10.1007/s11606-007-0161-0; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2014.09.006; 10.1186/1471-2458-11-29; 10.1002/jts.20357; 10.1007/s00127-013-0757-0; 10.1186/1471-244X-13-182; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2014.01.015; 10.1176/ajp.156.6.902; 10.1192/bjp.bp.113.131227; 10.1186/1471-244X-14-6; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.09.037","The authors have declared that no competing interests exists.","Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway."

A community-based intervention was administered to 204 participants as part of a large randomised controlled trial (called the CIVIC trial). Case-managers followed-up participants with regular telephone calls and home visits over the first 2 years after discharge. The following data were collected alongside the trial: (i) chart audit of telephone calls and home visits (ii) recordings of 20 telephone calls (iii) interviews with 14 Intervention participants and four healthcare professionals including three case-managers. Participants received the target number of telephone calls and home visits. Pressure injuries were identified as a problem during at least one telephone call by 43% of participants. Participants and case-managers valued regular telephone calls and home visits, and believed that calls and visits prevented complications and alleviated social isolation. Participants trusted case-managers and were confident in the care and advice provided. Case-managers expressed concerns that people with SCI in Bangladesh face many problems impacting on well-being and motivation stemming from poverty, limited employment opportunities, societal attitudes and inaccessible environments. A community-based intervention involving regular telephone calls and home visits was administered as intended and was well received by the recipients of the care.

We recently revealed a negative association between prosociality, a highly valued personality attribute in human society, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) &#x3b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in children at the age of 10 years. We thus hypothesized that prosociality would be intergenerationally transmitted, and that transmission would be underwritten by neurometabolic heritability. Here, we collected prosociality data from children aged 10 years and their parents in a large-scale population-based birth cohort study. We also measured ACC GABA+ and glutamate plus glutamine (Glx) levels in a follow-up assessment with a subsample of the participants (aged 11 years) using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We analyzed the associations among children's and parents' prosociality and GABA+/Glx ratios. We also examined the effect of socioeconomic status (SES) and verbalized parental affection (VPA) on these associations. We found a significant positive parent-child association for prosociality (N&#xa0;&#x200b;=&#xa0;&#x200b;3026; children's mean age 10.2 years) and GABA+/Glx ratio (N&#xa0;&#x200b;=&#xa0;&#x200b;99; children's mean age 11.4 years). There was a significant negative association between GABA+/Glx ratio and prosociality in both children (N&#xa0;&#x200b;=&#xa0;&#x200b;208) and parents (N&#xa0;&#x200b;=&#xa0;&#x200b;128). Our model accounting for the effects of neurometabolic heritability on prosociality transmission fitted well. Moreover, in this model, a significant positive effect of VPA but not SES on children's prosociality was observed independently of the effect of neurometabolic transmission, while SES but not VPA was significantly associated with parental prosociality. Our results provide novel insights into the neurometabolic substrates of parent-child transmission of social behavior.",2020,9,1,"NeuroImage","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116965",NA,"Neuroimage","eng","D000293; D000328; D001923; D002648; D002675; D015331; D005260; D005973; D006179; D006801; D016901; D008137; D008279; D009682; D008297; D009034; D010287; D010551; D011627; D012919; D012923; D005680","Adolescent; Adult; Brain Chemistry; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Female; Glutamine; Gyrus Cinguli; Humans; Intergenerational Relations; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Mother-Child Relations; Parent-Child Relations; Personality; Puberty; Social Behavior; Social Class; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",NA,"NA","Declaration of competing interest All authors declare no conflict of interests.","Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; International Research Center for Neurointelligence (WPI-IRCN), The University of Tokyo Institutes for Advanced Study (UTIAS), The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."

"32437448","Greater lifestyle engagement is associated with better age-adjusted cognitive abilities.","G Sophia Borgeest, Richard N Henson, Meredith Shafto, David Samu, Rogier A Kievit","Previous evidence suggests that modifiable lifestyle factors, such as engagement in leisure activities, might slow the age-related decline of cognitive functions. Less is known, however, about which aspects of lifestyle might be particularly beneficial to healthy cognitive ageing, and whether they are associated with distinct cognitive domains (e.g. fluid and crystallized abilities) differentially. We investigated these questions in the cross-sectional Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) data (N = 708, age 18-88), using data-driven exploratory structural equation modelling, confirmatory factor analyses, and age-residualized measures of cognitive differences across the lifespan. Specifically, we assessed the relative associations of the following five lifestyle factors on age-related differences of fluid and crystallized age-adjusted abilities: education/SES, physical health, mental health, social engagement, and intellectual engagement. We found that higher education, better physical and mental health, more social engagement and a greater degree of intellectual engagement were each individually correlated with better fluid and crystallized cognitive age-adjusted abilities. A joint path model of all lifestyle factors on crystallized and fluid abilities, which allowed a simultaneous assessment of the lifestyle domains, showed that physical health, social and intellectual engagement and education/SES explained unique, complementary variance, but mental health did not make significant contributions above and beyond the other four lifestyle factors and age. The total variance explained for fluid abilities was 14% and 16% for crystallized abilities. Our results are compatible with the hypothesis that intellectually and physically challenging as well as socially engaging activities are associated with better crystallized and fluid performance across the lifespan.",2020,1,1,"PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0230077","PMC7241829","PLoS One","eng","D000293; D000328; D000368; D000369; D003071; D000066492; D003430; D005260; D006304; D000073656; D006801; D007899; D008297; D008603; D008875; D012919; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cognition; Cognitive Aging; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Status; Healthy Aging; Humans; Leisure Activities; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Social Behavior; Young Adult","SUAG/047 G101400; BB/H008217/1; G0601022; 107392/Z/15/Z; SUAG/046 G101400; G9901400; MC_UU_00005/8; SUAG/014 RG91365; SUAG/010 RG91365","10.1016/j.cger.2013.07.002; 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2008.09.023; 10.1093/geronb/gbw124; 10.1037/a0026579; 10.1037/0882-7974.20.3.423; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002259; 10.1093/geronb/58.5.p249; 10.1037/a0024144; 10.1037/pag0000134; 10.1159/000089919; 10.1073/pnas.1811537116; 10.1037/h0059973; 10.1037//0003-066x.49.4.304; 10.1037/a0021361; 10.3233/JAD-161278; 10.1111/jgs.12967; 10.1162/jocn_a_00300; 10.1017/S1355617712000847; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1492-16.2016; 10.1016/j.jcps.2015.05.006; 10.1037/a0024503; 10.1186/s12883-014-0204-1; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.09.018; 10.1016/0022-3956(75)90026-6; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1983.tb09716.x; 10.1016/0165-1781(89)90047-4; 10.1017/S003329170600938X; 10.1101/267831; 10.1080/10705510903008204; 10.1016/j.tins.2017.10.001; 10.1017/S0033291717000836; 10.1027/1614-2241/a000130; 10.1207/S15328007SEM0803_5; 10.1080/00273171.2012.734737; 10.1016/j.intell.2012.02.008; 10.1016/j.intell.2005.06.004; 10.1037/0012-1649.16.6.625; 10.1016/0001-6918(67)90011-x; 10.18637/jss.v011.i10; 10.1016/j.paid.2016.06.069; 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014920; 10.1017/S1355617702813248; 10.1111/1467-9280.t01-1-01430; 10.1017/S1355617715000880; 10.1152/japplphysiol.00500.2006; 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.02903.x; 10.1136/bmj.j2709; 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2018.10.005; 10.1186/1742-7622-5-2; 10.1093/geronb/63.2.p67; 10.1016/j.acn.2007.01.021; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2011.08.001; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2012.08.023; 10.3389/fnagi.2010.00027; 10.1111/j.1532-5415.1995.tb06093.x; 10.3389/fnhum.2011.00026; 10.1037/met0000090","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."

Animal research suggests early life stressors impact later neurodevelopment, including myelin developmental growth. To determine how early life disadvantage may affect myelin growth in adolescence and young adulthood, we analysed data from an accelerated longitudinal neuroimaging study measuring magnetisation transfer (MT), a myelin-sensitive marker, in 288 participants (149 female) between 14 and 25&#x2009;years of age at baseline. We found that early life economic disadvantage before age 12, measured by a neighbourhood poverty index, was associated with slower myelin growth. This association was observed for magnetization transfer in cortical, subcortical and core white matter regions, and also in key subcortical nuclei. Participant IQ at baseline, alcohol use, body mass index, parental occupation and self-reported parenting quality did not account for these effects, but parental education did so partially. Specifically, positive parenting moderated the effect of socio-economic disadvantage in a protective manner. Thus, early socioeconomic disadvantage appears to alter myelin growth across adolescence. This finding has potential translational implications, including clarifying whether reducing socio-economic disadvantage during childhood, and increasing parental education and positive parenting, promote normal trajectories of brain development in economically disadvantaged contexts.",2020,8,15,"Human brain mapping","10.1002/hbm.25024","PMC7375075","Hum Brain Mapp","eng","D000293; D000328; D000076783; D001921; D005260; D006803; D006801; D008137; D008279; D008297; D009186; D016487; D011203; D065840; D012111; D012959; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Brain; Female; Human Development; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Myelin Sheath; Parenting; Poverty; Protective Factors; Residence Characteristics; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult","2017-1261-04; 095844/7/11/Z; 098362/Z/12/Z; MC_G0802534; NF-SI-0514-10157; 27023; 211155/Z/18/Z","10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199574131.001.0001/acprof-9780199574131-chapter-3; 10.1177/2167702613501496; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.03.029; 10.1371/journal.pone.0018712; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.10.033; 10.1093/ije/dyx117; 10.1111/obr.12248; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.3139; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1808-18.2018; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.07.078; 10.1371/journal.pone.0127052; 10.1017/S1355617710001335; 10.1016/j.nicl.2014.08.013; 10.3389/fnins.2013.00095; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.1558","  The authors have no financial or non&#x2010;financial competing interests to declare.

However, genetics and SES are correlated, and no prior study has assessed their neural associations independently. Here we used a polygenic score for educational attainment (EduYears-PGS), as well as SES, in a longitudinal study of 551 adolescents to tease apart genetic and environmental associations with brain development and cognition. Subjects received a structural MRI scan at ages 14 and 19. At both time points, they performed three working memory (WM) tasks. SES and EduYears-PGS were correlated (<i>r</i> = 0.27) and had both common and independent associations with brain structure and cognition. Specifically, lower SES was related to less total cortical surface area and lower WM. EduYears-PGS was also related to total cortical surface area, but in addition had a regional association with surface area in the right parietal lobe, a region related to nonverbal cognitive functions, including mathematics, spatial cognition, and WM. SES, but not EduYears-PGS, was related to a change in total cortical surface area from age 14 to 19. This study demonstrates a regional association of EduYears-PGS and the independent prediction of SES with cognitive function and brain development. It suggests that the SES inequalities, in particular parental education, are related to global aspects of cortical development, and exert a persistent influence on brain development during adolescence.",2020,6,2,"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","10.1073/pnas.2001228117","PMC7275733","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","eng","D000076363; D000293; D000328; D001921; D003071; D004522; D005260; D006801; D008137; D008279; D008297; D008570; D020412; D012923; D055815","Academic Success; Adolescent; Adult; Brain; Cognition; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Multifactorial Inheritance; Social Class; Young Adult","U01 CA198952; MRF_MRF-058-0004-RG-DESRI; MR/R00465X/1; R01 MH085772; U54 EB020403; R56 AG058854; MR/S020306/1; MRF_MRF-058-0009-RG-DESR-C0759; MR/N000390/1","NA","The authors declare no competing interest.","Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, 17165, Sweden;"

Three parasitic infections - cerebral malaria, Taenia solium cysticercosis and onchocerciasis - have an established association with epilepsy. Parasitoses are widely prevalent in low-income and middle-income countries, which are home to 80% of the people with epilepsy in the world. Once a parasitic infection has taken hold in the brain, therapeutic measures do not seem to influence the development of epilepsy in the long term. Consequently, strategies to control, eliminate and eradicate parasites represent the most feasible way to reduce the epilepsy burden at present. The elucidation of immune mechanisms underpinning the parasitic infections, some of which are parasite-specific, opens up new therapeutic possibilities. In this Review, we explore the pathophysiological basis of the link between parasitic infections and epilepsy, and we consider preventive and therapeutic approaches to reduce the burden of epilepsy attributable to parasitic disorders. We conclude that a concerted approach involving medical, veterinary, parasitological and ecological experts, backed by robust political support and sustainable funding, is the key to reducing this burden.",2020,6,1,"Nature reviews.

The current meta-analytic review examines the effectiveness of these interventions in families experiencing social disadvantage. A literature search was conducted spanning March 2007-June 2019. Nine studies met inclusion criteria (total of 864 participants) which included an evaluation of a parenting intervention for families with at least one of the following demographic challenges, low socioeconomic status, single parenthood, and/or young parenthood. Interventions (or a component of the intervention) were delivered by computer, cell phone, smartphone, and/or tablet. Data were organized into three categories: parental psychological well-being (e.g., self-esteem, social support), parenting (e.g., observed or self-reported parenting behavior), and child behavior (e.g., disruptive behavior). Effect sizes (Hedges' g) were calculated and moderators (i.e., contact with an interventionist, intervention length, publication year, % female parents, mean parent age, parental education, % minority, and child age) were examined through Q-statistics and meta-regression, as appropriate. Intervention showed a near-significant impact on parental psychological well-being (g&#x2009;=&#x2009;.35, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.051). Furthermore, interventions that did not include direct contact with an interventionist showed no evidence of effectiveness (g&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#x2009;.02); interventions that incorporated contact were significantly more effective (g&#x2009;=&#x2009;.68). In addition, intervention length moderated intervention effectiveness; shorter interventions yielded greater improvements in well-being, compared with longer interventions. Interventions were also associated with significant improvements in parenting (g&#x2009;=&#x2009;.38) and child behavior (g&#x2009;=&#x2009;.39).

We wished to identify factors influencing health service utilization for adolescent perinatal depression, in Nigeria to inform new strategies of care delivery. Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted among purposively selected low-income young mothers (with medical histories of adolescent perinatal depression), and separately with primary care clinicians treating this condition in Ibadan, Nigeria. Participants from this community-based study were from the database of respondents who participated in a previous randomized control trial (RCT) conducted between 2014 and 2016 in 28 primary health care facilities in the 11 Local government areas in Ibadan. Semi-structured interview guides, framed by themes of the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, was developed to obtain views of participants on the factors that promote or hinder help-seeking and engagement (see additional files 1 &amp; 2). FGDs were conducted, and saturation of themes was achieved after discussions with six groups. Transcripts were analyzed using content analysis. A total of 42 participants, 17 mothers (who were adolescents at the time of the RCT), and 25 care providers participated in 6 FGDs. The availability of care for perinatal depression at the primary care level was an important enabling factor in healthcare utilization for the adolescents. Perceived health benefits of treatment received for perinatal depression were strong motivation for service use. Significant stigma and negative stereotypes expressed by care providers towards adolescent pregnancy and perinatal depression were obstacles to care. However, individual patient resilience was a major enabling factor, facilitating service engagement. Providers trained in the management of perinatal depression were perceived to deliver more tolerant and supportive care that adolescent mothers valued. Participants identified unsupportive and stigmatizing clinic environments towards pregnant and parenting adolescents as significant barriers to accessing available care. Interventions to reduce stigma among healthcare providers may improve services for this vulnerable population.",2020,5,14,"BMC pregnancy and childbirth","10.1186/s12884-020-02970-4","PMC7226964","BMC Pregnancy Childbirth","eng","D000293; D003863; D005260; D017144; D007722; D006282; D006297; D006801; D008875; D009035; D009549; D010342; D018743; D011203; D011247; D011253; D011320; D036301; D057545; D055815","Adolescent; Depression; Female; Focus Groups; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Middle Aged; Mothers; Nigeria; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Perinatal Care; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy in Adolescence; Primary Health Care; Qualitative Research; Social Stigma; Young Adult","108552-001","NA","All contributing authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.","Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."

This study investigated perceptions and experiences of perinatal mental distress among women in a rural Ethiopian community, in an effort to advance understanding of cross-cultural experiences of perinatal mental distress. We employed a sequential explanatory study design. From a population-based cohort study of 1065 perinatal women in the Butajira Health and Demographic Surveillance Site, we purposively selected 22 women according to their scores on a culturally validated assessment of perinatal mental distress (the Self-Reporting Questionnaire). We examined concordance and discordance between qualitative semi-structured interview data ('emic' perspective) and the layperson-administered fully-structured questionnaire data ('etic' perspective) of perinatal mental distress. We analysed the questionnaire data using summary statistics and we carried out a thematic analysis of the qualitative data. Most women in this setting recognised the existence of perinatal mental distress states, but did not typically label such distress as a discrete illness. Instead, perinatal mental distress states were mostly seen as non-pathological reactions to difficult circumstances. The dominant explanatory model of perinatal mental distress was as a response to poverty, associated with inadequate food, isolation, and hopelessness. Support from family and friends, both emotional and instrumental support, was regarded as vital in protecting against mental distress. Although some women considered their distress amenable to biomedical solution, many thought medical help-seeking was inappropriate. Integration of perspectives from the questionnaire and semi-structured interviews highlighted the important role of somatic symptoms and nutritional status. It also demonstrated the differential likelihood of endorsement of symptoms when screening tools versus in-depth interviews are used. This study highlights the importance of the wider social context within which mental health problems are situated, specificially the inseparability of mental health from gender disadvantage, physical health and poverty. This implies that public health prevention strategies, assessments and interventions for perinatal distress should be developed from the bottom-up, taking account of local contexts and explanatory frameworks.",2020,5,12,"BMC psychiatry","10.1186/s12888-020-02646-5","PMC7216512","BMC Psychiatry","eng","D015331; D005260; D006801; D001523; D008603; D036801; D011247; D012424","Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Parturition; Pregnancy; Rural Population","071643","10.4103/2141-9248.139268; 10.1016/j.jad.2017.05.003; 10.2471/BLT.11.091850; 10.1016/S2215-0366(16)30284-X; 10.1016/j.jad.2011.11.028; 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61277-0; 10.1192/bjp.151.4.447; 10.1016/0277-9536(83)90408-2; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02160.x; 10.1186/s12905-014-0140-7; 10.1177/1363461516632389; 10.1007/s00737-014-0431-x; 10.1186/s13033-017-0134-6; 10.1007/s00737-010-0149-3; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.07.043; 10.1007/BF00788925; 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.112.967885; 10.1016/j.jad.2007.10.023; 10.1097/00006842-200203000-00008; 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; 10.1111/1475-6773.12117; 10.1192/bjp.184.46.s10; 10.1016/j.whi.2016.07.002; 10.1016/j.jad.2015.06.029; 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010834; 10.1371/journal.pone.0163103; 10.1186/1471-244X-12-239; 10.1016/j.jad.2015.07.015; 10.1007/s11013-006-9040-0; 10.3402/qhw.v10.26226; 10.1186/1471-244X-14-60; 10.1016/j.healthplace.2012.05.004; 10.1136/bmj.321.7272.1311; 10.1016/S0968-8080(99)90004-6; 10.1111/tmi.12658; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.11.019; 10.1186/s12978-018-0637-x; 10.1186/1745-0179-5-8; 10.1177/1077801216654018; 10.1016/j.jad.2009.09.017","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Department of Anthropology, Durham University, Dawson Building, South Road, Durham, DH1 3LE, UK."

Low SES is a risk factor for hypertension and high blood pressure (BP). To identify novel BP loci, we performed multi-ancestry meta-analyses accounting for gene-educational attainment interactions using two variables, ""Some College"" (yes/no) and ""Graduated College"" (yes/no). Interactions were evaluated using both a 1 degree of freedom (DF) interaction term and a 2DF joint test of genetic and interaction effects. Analyses were performed for systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure, and pulse pressure. We pursued genome-wide interrogation in Stage 1 studies (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;117 438) and follow-up on promising variants in Stage 2 studies (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;293 787) in five ancestry groups.

Two novel loci were identified based on the 1DF test of interaction with educational attainment, while the remaining 16 loci were identified through the 2DF joint test of genetic and interaction effects. Ten novel loci were identified in individuals of African ancestry. Several novel loci show strong biological plausibility since they involve physiologic systems implicated in BP regulation. They include genes involved in the central nervous system-adrenal signaling axis (ZDHHC17, CADPS, PIK3C2G), vascular structure and function (GNB3, CDON), and renal function (HAS2 and HAS2-AS1, SLIT3).

Staging of the same embryos in a way that generally follow the description of external features of human embryos in the Carnegie stages 10 to 23 allowed us to describe 14 stages of porcine embryonic development that correlate to the Carnegie stages of human development with minor species differences. When arranged by average age, the statistic clusters had a distribution that correlated well with the stages produced by the Carnegie-based staging system. Statistical analysis of developmental events allow grouping of porcine embryos into clusters that can be extrapolated into a Carnegie-based staging system, thus serving the dual purpose of facilitating the use of the pig as a biomedical model animal and providing data for integrating porcine developmental events into a phylogenetic context.",2020,10,1,"Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists","10.1002/dvdy.187",NA,"Dev Dyn","eng","D000818; D016000; D015509; D004622; D005121; D005260; D018507; D006321; D006801; D015233; D009474; D010802; D011247; D011270; D012015; D013552","Animals; Cluster Analysis; Developmental Biology; Embryo, Mammalian; Extremities; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Heart; Humans; Models, Statistical; Neurons; Phylogeny; Pregnancy; Pregnancy, Animal; Reference Standards; Swine",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark."

Unfortunately, while low sensitivity leads to under-identification of at-risk children, low specificity can lead to over-identification, resulting in inaccurate allocation of limited educational resources. The present study focused on children identified as at-risk in kindergarten who do not subsequently develop poor reading skills to specify factors associated with better reading outcomes among at-risk children. Early screening was conducted in kindergarten and a subset of children was tracked longitudinally until second grade. Potential protective factors were evaluated at cognitive-linguistic, environmental, and neural levels. Relative to at-risk kindergarteners with subsequent poor reading, those with typical reading outcomes were characterized by significantly higher socioeconomic status (SES), speech production accuracy, and structural organization of the posterior right-hemispheric superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). A positive association between structural organization of the right SLF and subsequent decoding skills was found to be specific to at-risk children and not observed among typical controls. Among at-risk children, several kindergarten-age factors were found to significantly contribute to the prediction of subsequent decoding skills: white matter organization in the posterior right SLF, age, gender, SES, and phonological awareness. These findings suggest that putative compensatory mechanisms are already present by the start of kindergarten. The right SLF, in conjunction with the cognitive-linguistic and socioeconomic factors identified, may play an important role in facilitating reading development among at-risk children. This study has important implications for approaches to early screening, and assessment strategies for at-risk children.",2021,1,1,"Developmental science","10.1111/desc.12983","PMC7606625","Dev Sci","eng","D001364; D002648; D002675; D004410; D006801; D008137; D059906; D011932; D066127","Awareness; Child; Child, Preschool; Dyslexia; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Neuroimaging; Reading; White Matter","F31 DC015919; R01 HD067312; R01 HD065762; T32 DC000038","10.1037/0022-0663.100.2.235; 10.1598/RRQ.23.3.2; 10.1371/journal.pone.0083668; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.12.053; 10.1111/j.1468-4446.2010.01345.x; 10.1016/S0166-4328(01)00297-2; 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233; 10.1044/2018_LSHSS-DYSLC-18-0008; 10.1177/0956797611434536; 10.1207/s1532799xssr0801_3; 10.1111/desc.12153; 10.1037/a0025323; 10.1044/0161-1461(2001/004); 10.1177/0022219413498115; 10.1037/neu0000243; 10.1037/a0018448; 10.1016/0885-2006(87)90010-X; 10.1016/j.neuron.2004.10.019; 10.1037/0022-0663.96.4.660; 10.1177/0022219418775116; 10.1111/desc.12019; 10.1017/S0021963099005284; 10.1016/j.jcomdis.2008.10.004; 10.1044/0161-1461(2005/031); 10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.003; 10.2307/1131364; 10.1073/pnas.1008950108; 10.1177/0956797615603702; 10.1016/j.cogpsych.2010.08.002; 10.1111/jcpp.12029; 10.1093/cercor/bhv281; 10.1007/s11881-003-0001-9; 10.1016/j.jecp.2017.10.003; 10.1037/a0026744; 10.1007/s11881-002-0008-7; 10.1111/j.1475-3588.2007.00480.x; 10.1006/jmla.1998.2564; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00542.x; 10.1007/s11881-008-0014-5; 10.1044/0161-1461(2011/10-0064); 10.1002/wcs.1383; 10.1111/desc.12471; 10.1002/hbm.24407; 10.1017/S0305000904006270; 10.1016/j.cognition.2006.04.008; 10.1111/1467-8624.00317; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60198-6; 10.1002/dys.1560; 10.1016/S0021-9924(01)00060-0; 10.1002/(SICI)1099-0909(199912)5:4&lt;227:AID-DYS146&gt;3.0.CO;2-6; 10.1016/j.bandl.2014.04.001; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2012.01805.x; 10.1002/icd.1924; 10.1126/science.1167025; 10.1037/0022-0663.81.1.101; 10.2307/1130834; 10.1007/s11881-998-0006-5; 10.1044/jshr.3301.70; 10.1037/0022-0663.96.2.265; 10.1037/0022-0663.92.2.284; 10.1111/1467-8624.00417; 10.1044/jslhr.4004.708; 10.1002/hbm.10062; 10.1353/foc.2016.0012; 10.1111/1467-8624.7402003; 10.1037/bul0000037; 10.1111/desc.12190; 10.1177/00222194050380060301; 10.1598/RRQ.21.4.1; 10.1073/pnas.0030098100; 10.1002/mrm.23228; 10.1016/S0022-4405(01)00092-9; 10.1177/0022219410369096; 10.1007/s00429-016-1302-1; 10.1080/10888438.2015.1050103; 10.1111/jcpp.12910; 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00346; 10.1002/rrq.160; 10.1016/j.dcn.2017.08.003; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2012.04.002; 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.07.008; 10.1016/j.dcn.2015.05.006; 10.1037/0022-0663.88.4.601; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.02.049; 10.1093/cercor/bhw095; 10.3102/0034654313477212; 10.1371/journal.pone.0049790; 10.1111/cdep.12293; 10.1002/hbm.24980","CONFLIC T OF INTEREST.

"32353317","Use of the six core surgical indicators from the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery in Colombia: a situational analysis.","Joseph S Hanna, Gabriel E Herrera-Almario, Monica Pinilla-Roncancio, David Tulloch, Sergio A Valencia, Marlena E Sabatino, Charles Hamilton, Shahyan U Rehman, Ardi Knobel Mendoza,  ..., Gregory L Peck","Surgical, anaesthetic, and obstetric (SAO) health-care system strengthening is needed to address the emergency and essential surgical care that approximately 5 billion individuals lack globally. To our knowledge, a complete, non-modelled national situational analysis based on the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery surgical indicators has not been done. We aimed to undertake a complete situation analysis of SAO system preparedness, service delivery, and financial risk protection using the core surgical indicators proposed by the Commission in Colombia, an upper-middle-income country. Data to inform the six core surgical system indicators were abstracted from the Colombian national health information system and the most recent national health survey done in 2007. Geographical access to a Bellwether hospital (defined as a hospital capable of providing essential and emergency surgery) within 2 h was assessed by determining 2 h drive time boundaries around Bellwether facilities and the population within and outside these boundaries. Physical 2 h access to a Bellwether was determined by the presence of a motor vehicle suitable for individual transportation. The Department Administrativo Nacional de Estad&#xed;stica population projection for 2016 and 2018 was used to calculate the SAO provider density. Total operative volume was calculated for 2016 and expressed nationally per 100&#x2008;000 population. The total number of postoperative deaths that occurred within 30 days of a procedure was divided by the total operative volume to calculate the all-cause, non-risk-adjusted postoperative mortality. The proportion of the population subject to impoverishing costs was calculated by subtracting the baseline number of impoverished individuals from those who fell below the poverty line once out-of-pocket payments were accounted for. Individuals who incurred out-of-pocket payments that were more than 10% of their annual household income were considered to have experienced catastrophic expenditure. Using GIS mapping, SAO system preparedness, service delivery, and cost protection were also contextualised by socioeconomic status. In 2016, at least 7&#xb7;1 million people (15&#xb7;1% of the population) in Colombia did not have geographical access to SAO services within a 2 h driving distance. SAO provider density falls short of the Commission's minimum target of 20 providers per 100&#x2008;000 population, at an estimated density of 13&#xb7;7 essential SAO health-care providers per 100&#x2008;000 population in 2018. Lower socioeconomic status of a municipality, as indicated by proportion of people enrolled in the subsidised insurance regime, was associated with a smaller proportion of the population in the municipality being within 2 h of a Bellwether facility, and the most socioeconomically disadvantaged municipalities often had no SAO providers. Furthermore, Colombian providers appear to be working at or beyond capacity, doing 2690-3090 procedures per 100&#x2008;000 population annually, but they have maintained a relatively low median postoperative mortality of 0&#xb7;74% (IQR 0&#xb7;48-0&#xb7;84). Finally, out-of-pocket expenses for indirect health-care costs were a key barrier to accessing surgical care, prompting 3&#xb7;1 million (6&#xb7;4% of the population) individuals to become impoverished and 9&#xb7;5 million (19&#xb7;4% of the population) individuals to incur catastrophic expenditures in 2007. We did a non-modelled, indicator-based situation analysis of the Colombian SAO system, finding that it has not yet met, but is working towards achieving, the targets set by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery. The observed interdependence of these indicators and correlation with socioeconomic status are consistent with well recognised factors and outcomes of social, health, and health-care inequity. The internal consistency observed in Colombia's situation analysis validates the use of the indicators and has now informed development of an early national SAO plan in Colombia, to set a data-informed stage for implementation and evaluation of timely, safe, and affordable SAO health care, within the National Public Health Decennial Plan, which is due in 2022.

However, there is no consensus framework for studying the health impacts of anti-poverty social policies. In this paper, we describe a case study in which leading global experts systematically: (1) developed a conceptual model that outlines the potential pathways through which a social policy influences health, (2) fits outcome measures to this conceptual model, and (3) estimates an optimal time frame for collection of the selected outcome measures. This systematic process, called the Delphi method, has the potential to produce estimates more quickly and with less bias than might be achieved through expert panel discussions alone.

We examined the differences in adult earnings of males and females with and without a history of depressive disorder in adolescence, with specific focuses on (1) future earnings in clinical subtypes of adolescent depression; (2) the growth and distribution of earnings over time within these subgroups and (3) the mediating role of subsequent depressive episodes occurring in early adulthood. Data were drawn from the Uppsala Longitudinal Adolescent Depression Study, a community-based cohort study initiated in Uppsala, Sweden, in the early 1990s. Comprehensive diagnostic assessments were conducted at age 16-17 and in follow-up interviews 15 years later, while consecutive data on earnings for the years 1996 to 2016 (ages 20-40) were drawn from population-based registries. The current study included participants with a history of persistent depressive disorder (PDD) (n = 175), episodic major depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 82), subthreshold depression (n = 64) or no depression (n = 218) in adolescence. The association of adolescent depression with earnings in adulthood was analysed using generalised estimating equations. Estimates were adjusted for major child and adolescent psychiatric comorbidities and parental socioeconomic status. The indirect (mediated) effect of depression in early adulthood (ages 19-30) on earnings in mid-adulthood (31-40) was estimated in mediation analysis. The study followed the 'STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology' (STROBE) guidelines. Earnings across early to middle adulthood were lower for participants with a history of a PDD in adolescence than for their non-depressed peers, with an adjusted ratio of mean earnings of 0.85 (0.77-0.95) for females and 0.76 (0.60-0.95) for males. The differences were consistent over time, and more pronounced in the lower percentiles of the earnings distributions.

Prior family studies suggest that familial liability, likely reflecting increased genetic risk, and socioeconomic status (SES) contribute to premorbid maladjustment. However, their joint effect possibly indicating gene-environment interaction has not been evaluated. We examined whether family history of psychosis (FHP) and parental SES may predict PA and AAO in unrelated cases with first-episode psychosis (n = 108) and schizophrenia (n = 104). Premorbid academic and social functioning domains during childhood and early adolescence were retrospectively assessed. Regression analyses were performed to investigate main effects of FHP and parental SES, as well as their interaction. The relationships between PA, AAO, and response to antipsychotic medication were also explored. Positive FHP associated with academic PA difficulties and importantly interacted with parental SES to moderate social PA during childhood (interaction p = 0.024). Positive FHP and parental SES did not predict differences in AAO. Nevertheless, an earlier AAO was observed among cases with worse social PA in childhood (&#x3b2; = -0.20; p = 0.005) and early adolescence (&#x3b2; = -0.19; p = 0.007). Further, confirming evidence emerged for an association between deficient childhood social PA and poor treatment response (p = 0.04). Familial risk for psychosis may interact with parental socioeconomic position influencing social PA in childhood. In addition, this study supports the link between social PA deviations, early psychosis onset, and treatment resistance, which highlights premorbid social functioning as a promising clinical indicator.",2020,4,29,"European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists","10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.41","PMC7355181","Eur Psychiatry","eng","D000293; D000328; D017668; D014150; D002648; D005260; D020022; D006801; D008297; D011618; D012189; D012307; D012559; D012917; D012959; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Age of Onset; Antipsychotic Agents; Child; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Male; Psychotic Disorders; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Schizophrenia; Social Adjustment; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult",NA,"10.1192/bjp.2019.120",NA,"Department of Psychiatry, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School, Eginition Hospital, 11528 Athens, Greece."

A Repeated Measures Evaluation of the PACT Project Run in a Socially Deprived London Borough.","June Brown, Ana Luderowski, Josephine Namusisi-Riley, Imogen Moore-Shelley, Matthew Bolton, Derek Bolton","Social adversity can significantly influence the wellbeing of mothers and their children. Maternal health may be improved through strengthened support networks and better health literacy. Health improvement at the population level requires optimizing of the collaboration between statutory health services, civic organizations (e.g., churches, schools), as well as community groups and parents. Two key elements in improving community engagement are co-production and community control. This study evaluated a co-produced and community-led project, PACT (Parents and Communities Together), for mothers in a deprived south London borough. The project offered social support and health education. Intended effects were improvements in mental health, health literacy, and social support, assessed by standardized measures in a pre-post design. Sixty-one mothers consented to take part in the evaluation. Significant improvements were found in mental health measures, in health literacy, for those with low literacy at baseline, and in overall and some specific aspects of social support. Satisfaction with the project was high. We found that the project engaged local populations that access statutory health services relatively less. We conclude that community-organized and community-led interventions in collaboration with statutory health services can increase accessibility and can improve mothers' mental health and other health-related outcomes.",2020,4,18,"International journal of environmental research and public health","10.3390/ijerph17082795","PMC7215628","Int J Environ Res Public Health","eng","D000328; D002648; D003153; D005192; D005260; D006266; D057220; D006801; D008131; D000068097; D009035; D011181; D011203; D012944; D012959; D006113","Adult; Child; Community Health Services; Family Health; Female; Health Education; Health Literacy; Humans; London; Maternal Health; Mothers; Postnatal Care; Poverty; Social Support; Socioeconomic Factors; United Kingdom",NA,"10.1093/bmb/ldr047; 10.1016/0029-7844(94)00449-n; 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2011.03701.x; 10.1093/heapro/15.3.259; 10.1093/heapro/dax015; 10.1136/bmj.m693; 10.1093/pubmed/fdv017; 10.3390/ijerph17072523; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.11.027; 10.1111/1467-9515.00300; 10.1001/archinte.166.10.1092; 10.3928/0048-5713-20020901-06; 10.1370/afm.405; 10.1001/jama.2010.896; 10.1093/wbro/15.2.225; 10.2105/AJPH.2010.300113; 10.1046/j.1365-2648.1999.01041.x; 10.1007/BF00918174; 10.1007/BF00927113; 10.1002/bin.2360040104; 10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.155; 10.1186/1472-6963-12-249; 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012337; 10.1186/s12888-016-0736-6; 10.1007/s00127-014-0900-6; 10.3399/bjgp10X501877; 10.1186/s12888-014-0275-y; 10.1177/1049732315591483; 10.1177/0020764009357400; 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2013.04.006; 10.1007/s10865-019-00046-z; 10.1037/bul0000015; 10.1007/s00127-017-1421-x; 10.1017/S2045796013000504","The authors declare no conflict of interest.

The current objectives were to determine: 1) how well a theoretically-derived ACEs model fit the data, and 2) the association of all ACEs and the ACEs factors with poor self-rated mental and physical health. Data were obtained from the Well-Being and Experiences Study, survey data of adolescents aged 14 to 17&#x2009;years (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1002) and their parents (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1000) in Manitoba, Canada collected from 2017 to 2018. Statistical methods included confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and logistic regression models. The study findings indicated a two-factor solution for both the adolescent and parent sample as follows: a) child maltreatment and peer victimization and b) household challenges factors, provided the best fit to the data. All original and expanded ACEs loaded on one of these two factors and all individual ACEs were associated with either poor self-rated mental health, physical health or both in unadjusted models and with the majority of findings remaining statistically significant in adjusted models (Adjusted Odds Ratios ranged from 1.16-3.25 among parents and 1.12-8.02 among adolescents). Additionally, both factors were associated with poor mental and physical health. Findings confirm a two-factor structure (i.e., 1) child maltreatment and peer victimization and 2) household challenges) and indicate that the ACEs list should include original ACEs (i.e., physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, emotional neglect, physical neglect, exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV), household substance use, household mental health problems, parental separation or divorce, parental problems with police) and expanded ACEs (i.e., spanking, peer victimization, household gambling problems, foster care placement or child protective organization (CPO) contact, poverty, and neighborhood safety).",2020,4,21,"BMC pediatrics","10.1186/s12887-020-02063-3","PMC7171813","BMC Pediatr","eng","D000293; D000076783; D002170; D002648; D002649; D005163; D006801; D010290","Adolescent; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Canada; Child; Child Abuse; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Humans; Parents",NA,"10.1016/S0749-3797(98)00017-8; 10.1001/jama.282.17.1652; 10.1542/peds.111.3.564; 10.1016/j.amepre.2007.01.005; 10.1016/j.jad.2003.12.013; 10.1001/jama.286.24.3089; 10.1016/j.ypmed.2019.03.032; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181907888; 10.1186/1471-2458-10-20; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2004.01.008; 10.1016/S0306-4603(01)00204-0; 10.1016/j.amepre.2015.07.022; 10.1016/j.ypmed.2011.06.015; 10.1542/peds.2007-3412; 10.1016/j.amepre.2018.10.016; 10.1001/archpedi.159.12.1104; 10.1007/s00406-005-0624-4; 10.1016/j.amepre.2008.02.002; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2015.08.017; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2009.09.020; 10.1542/peds.2009-0597; 10.1016/j.acap.2008.11.003; 10.1037/ort0000144; 10.1177/070674370505001207; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.420; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2015.07.011; 10.1016/j.amepre.2015.02.001; 10.1016/j.pedhc.2018.04.021; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2015.11.021; 10.1037/a0037723; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2017.01.014; 10.1177/1077559516679513; 10.1037/pas0000691; 10.1007/s11469-007-9126-0; 10.1007/BF03404366; 10.1177/1524838014561269; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2019.01.024; 10.1007/s10899-017-9669-3; 10.1556/2006.6.2017.077; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2017.03.016; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2009.07.010; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2013.09.004; 10.1017/S0033291718000181; 10.1177/0706743719833675; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2008.05.003; 10.1542/peds.2012-4021; 10.1542/peds.2011-2947; 10.1186/s12889-017-4359-8; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00218.x","The authors declare that they have no competing interest.","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, and of Pediatrics, Offord Centre for Child Studies, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."

This study used 26 internationally available and validated indicators to explore and perform the analysis leading to the development of the Index. As with many summary statistics used to describe matters across the globe there has to be a fundamental reliance on national reporting or gathering of the underlying information used in their derivation, although their reliability may be in question and, in addition, such an exercise can be refined and repeated every year. It is concluded that the countries which score worse on the Index are likely to be failed states or fragile states: countries where the governments do not have complete control or authority. Such governments can often be repressive and corrupt, may participate in serious human rights abuses, and are characterized by conflict of various forms. These governments are also likely to suffer disadvantage as a result of extremes of climate changes, extreme poverty, inequality, social and ethnic divisions, the inability to provide basic services, and suffer from pockets of insurgency in the form of terrorism, which are often violent and brutal.",2021,1,1,"International review of psychiatry (Abingdon, England)","10.1080/09540261.2020.1738093",NA,"Int Rev Psychiatry","eng","D004645; D006806; D006801; D007391; D011203","Empathy; Human Rights; Humans; International Cooperation; Poverty",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy."

Specific social and financial factors mediate the effects of financial crisis on mental health, such as poverty, financial difficulties and unemployment. During the recent international financial crisis, studies in many countries have shown that the worsening of various mental health indicators was related to financial difficulties and unemployment. In Greece, which is one of the countries that experienced intense and prolonged economic and social burden due to the recent crisis, the epidemiological findings were similar and the increase of the prevalence of major depression and suicide was excessive. However, the information about the mental health of the population deriving from health services is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the crisis on community mental health -more specifically the rates of mental disorders and suicide, as well as the role of unemployment- among the new cases of a community mental health unit. The sample consisted of 1,865 adult users, men and women, who came seeking for help to the Byron-Kessariani Community Mental Health Centre (CMHC) during the years 2008-2013, i.e. the early years of the current crisis. Regarding the rates of the diagnostic categories in the new cases of CMHC per year, no significant differentiation was observed. There was an increase in the proportion of the unemployed individuals in the total sample of new cases during the study, from 9.65% in 2008 to 26.17% in 2013 and a significant association between unemployment and the occurrence of anxiety and depressive disorders, as indicated by the increase in the proportion of unemployed individuals among new cases with disorders of these categories. There was an upward trend in the rate of new patients referred to CMHC after a suicide attempt, which was doubled during the first years of the crisis. There was also an increase in the rate of unemployed individuals among these cases, from 10% in 2008 to 41.7% in 2009, reaching the highest level in 2011 (53.3%). The findings of this study suggest that during economic crisis unemployment plays an important role in the development of anxiety and depressive disorders and is closely related to suicide attempts.

This longitudinal study extends previous research on early adversity to ask the question: Does quality of parental care predict infant health in a low-risk community sample? Participants were 187 healthy mothers and their full-term infants (86 girls) from the Netherlands, followed from birth to age 1. Home observations of mothers' behavior were conducted during a naturalistic task (bathing session) when infants were 5 weeks old. Trained researchers interviewed mothers about the infants' health and prescribed antibiotic use every month for 12 months. Infant health problems were categorized into 4 domains according to the International Classification of Primary Care to capture a range of outcomes: respiratory, digestive, skin, and general illnesses and symptoms. Controlling for health-related covariates (e.g., maternal smoking and breastfeeding), maternal sensitivity predicted reduced rates of infant respiratory symptoms and skin conditions and marginally lower prescribed antibiotic use over the first year. Maternal behavior was unrelated to infant digestive and general illnesses. Even in the absence of adversity, quality of maternal care may have implications for the development of physical health, beginning as early as the first year of life. That such findings emerge in a low-risk sample helps rule out potential confounders and underscores the importance of parenting for physical and psychological health outcomes.",2020,8,1,"Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP","10.1097/DBP.0000000000000804","PMC9364161","J Dev Behav Pediatr","eng","D000328; D000900; D002668; D004066; D011307; D005260; D006304; D006801; D007223; D008137; D008297; D008425; D009035; D009426; D016487; D012120; D012871","Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Child Rearing; Digestive System Diseases; Drug Prescriptions; Female; Health Status; Humans; Infant; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Maternal Behavior; Mothers; Netherlands; Parenting; Respiration Disorders; Skin Diseases","DP2 MD013947; F32 HD102119","NA","Disclosure: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.","Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands."

Second, we examine existing studies that link childhood poverty, brain development, and physical and mental health outcomes. Third, we discuss studies linking childhood poverty and environmental risks and protective factors. Lastly, we discuss suggestions for future studies including advances in network neuroscience, population neuroscience, using multiple imaging modalities, and the use of longitudinal neuroimaging studies. Overall, associations between childhood poverty, brain development, and development over the life course may help to both better understand and eventually reveal salient intervention strategies to mitigate social disparities in health.",2020,1,1,"International review of neurobiology","10.1016/bs.irn.2019.12.001",NA,"Int Rev Neurobiol","eng","D000293; D000328; D000076783; D001921; D002648; D005260; D006803; D006801; D009415; D059906; D011203; D011247; D011297","Adolescent; Adult; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Brain; Child; Female; Human Development; Humans; Nerve Net; Neuroimaging; Poverty; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects",NA,"NA",NA,"Departments of Design and Environmental Analysis and of Human Development, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States."

However, the mechanisms by which schizophrenia may have influenced the economic status of a household in rural communities are still unclear. This study aimed to test an integrated model of schizophrenia, social support and caregiving burden on household poverty in a rural community in China. A mental health survey using identical methods and ICD-10 was conducted in six townships of Xinjin County (population&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;15&#xa0;years old, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;152,776), Chengdu, China in 2015. Identified persons with schizophrenia (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;661) and their caregivers completed a joint questionnaire of sociodemographic information, illness conditions, social support and caregiving burden. Descriptive analysis was applied first to give an overview of the dataset. Then, multivariable regression analyses were conducted to examine the associative factors of social support, caregiving burden and household income. Then, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to estimate the integrated model of schizophrenia, social support, caregiving burden and household income. Households with patient being female, married, able to work and having better social function were better off. Larger household size, higher social support and lower caregiving burden also had salient association with higher household income. The relationship between schizophrenia and household poverty appeared to be mediated by the impacts of schizophrenia on social support and caregiving burden. There was a strong association between schizophrenia and household poverty, in which social support and caregiving burden may had played significant roles on mediating it. More precise poverty alleviation policies and interventions should focus on supporting recovery for persons with schizophrenia, as well as on increasing social support and on reducing family caregiving burden.",2020,12,1,"Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology","10.1007/s00127-020-01864-2",NA,"Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol","eng","D017028; D002681; D017281; D005260; D006801; D011203; D012424; D012559; D012944","Caregivers; China; Cost of Illness; Female; Humans; Poverty; Rural Population; Schizophrenia; Social Support","Dept.

While the developed world continues to take advantage of this technology, its concept remains new to Pakistan. This study aims to assess the knowledge and perceptions regarding telemedicine among health care professionals in Karachi, Pakistan. Methods&#xa0; This cross-sectional study was carried out among doctors employed in the public health sector in Karachi from June 2018 to August 2018. Data were&#xa0;collected using a self-designed well-structured questionnaire using a five-point Likert scale, built after an extensive literature review. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS version 22. Categorical data were reported as frequencies and percentages. Results A total of 224 doctors, working in the Department of Internal Medicine (27.6%), Pediatrics (9.8%), Cardiology (6.6%), Gynecology (5.35%), Neurology (5.8%), and other specialties (44.6%), participated in the study. A total of 80.7 % of the doctors were aware of the definition of telemedicine. A total of 28.1% of them believed telemedicine to be effective in providing faster medical care while 23.2% thought of it as a means of reducing the white coat syndrome. A total of 42.9% believed that telemedicine disrupts the doctor-patient relationship and causes a breach of patient privacy. A total of 34.8% of the doctors favored the idea of introducing national standards for practicing telemedicine while 33.5% of doctors also agreed that providing a legal explanation of telemedicine to patients was of paramount importance. Poverty and lack of education (90.6%) was thought to be the biggest barrier to the practice of telemedicine in the developing world. Conclusions The knowledge regarding telemedicine among doctors in Karachi was found to be average. However, the perceptions about and attitude towards the introduction and implementation of this new technology were welcomed by the majority of participants with an emphasis on increasing awareness.

We investigated the relationship among serum CRP, PTSD, and traits related to traumatic events and social support using genetic association data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (23,185 PTSD cases and 151,309 controls), the UK Biobank (UKB; up to 117,900 individuals), and the CHARGE study (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology, 148,164 individual).

To investigate whether lower IQ contributed to the association between population density or deprivation and nonaffective psychosis (mediation) and whether these associations were stronger in people with lower IQ (effect modification). This prospective cohort study evaluated a population-based sample of men born in Sweden from January 1, 1982, to December 31, 1988, and conscripted into military service at 18 years of age. Data were collected from January 1, 1982, to December 31, 2016, and analyzed from May 1 to December 31, 2018. Continuous measures of small area-level population density (persons per square kilometer) and socioeconomic deprivation at birth. Deprivation was based on area-level social, criminal, and unemployment data. IQ was assessed during conscription at 18 years of age (mean [SD] IQ, 100 [15]). First diagnosis of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, nonaffective psychosis from 18 years of age until December 31, 2016, recorded in the National Patient Register. The study sample included a total of 227&#x202f;429 men who were classified as at risk of psychosis from 18 years of age until the end of follow-up. Of these, 1596 men (0.7%) were diagnosed with nonaffective psychosis. After adjustments for confounders, odds of nonaffective psychosis increased per 1-SD increase in population density (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.14) and deprivation (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13) at birth. IQ was negatively associated with deprivation after adjustments (effect estimate per 1-SD increase in deprivation: -0.70 points; 95% CI, -0.78 to -0.62 points) but not with population density. In mediation analyses, based on the potential outcome framework, 23% (95% CI, 17%-49%) of the total effect of deprivation on nonaffective psychosis was mediated by IQ. IQ did not modify associations between deprivation or population density and nonaffective psychosis. These findings suggest that being born in more deprived neighborhoods may partly increase risk of nonaffective psychosis through subsequent effects on cognitive development, consistent with the wider literature on neurodevelopmental delays associated with psychotic disorder. Identifying factors in deprived environments that give rise to this process could inform public health strategies to prevent nonaffective psychosis.",2020,7,1,"JAMA psychiatry","10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.0103","PMC7066518","JAMA Psychiatry","eng","D000293; D000328; D015331; D006801; D007360; D008297; D011156; D011203; D011618; D012042; D012111; D013548; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Cohort Studies; Humans; Intelligence; Male; Population Density; Poverty; Psychotic Disorders; Registries; Residence Characteristics; Sweden; Young Adult","G0701503; 201486/Z/16/Z; 101272/Z/13/Z","10.1093/schbul/sbs096; 10.1002/wps.20056; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.101; 10.1093/schbul/sbs151; 10.1056/NEJM199902253400803; 10.1192/bjp.184.4.293; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.0577; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.3554; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.2640; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.1581; 10.1017/S0033291717001696; 10.1093/schbul/sbu105; 10.1038/s41588-018-0152-6; 10.1016/S0140-6736(94)90569-X; 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62036-X; 10.1016/j.schres.2011.06.017; 10.1001/archpsyc.61.4.354; 10.1037/a0021072; 10.1038/nrg.2017.104; 10.1016/j.intell.2014.10.002; 10.1037/a0035893; 10.1073/pnas.1106077109; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.4491; 10.1016/j.schres.2009.10.015; 10.1017/S1355617702813248; 10.1093/schbul/sbw147; 10.1186/1471-2458-11-450; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.2233; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.0583; 10.1136/jech.2002.006361; 10.1093/ije/31.2.422; 10.1177/0956797618774253; 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2010.09.003; 10.1038/npp.2015.274; 10.1016/0005-7967(94)90131-7; 10.1093/schbul/sbs147; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2009.01500.x; 10.1093/ije/dyy193; 10.1017/S0033291797005680; 10.1037/a0020761; 10.1093/aje/kwj169; 10.1038/tp.2016.62","<b>Conflict of Interest Disclosures:</b> Dr Karlsson reported receiving grants from Stanley Medical Research Institute during the conduct of the study.

Thus, we assessed this association among older adults from six LMICs. Community-based cross-sectional data of the Study on Global Aging and Adult Health were analyzed. Sarcopenia was defined as the presence of low skeletal muscle mass based on indirect population formula, and either slow gait or low handgrip strength. Quintiles of vegetable and fruit consumption were created based on the number of servings consumed on a typical day. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted. The sample consisted of 14,585 individuals aged &#x2265;65 years (mean (SD) age 72.6 (11.4) years; 55% females). Adjusted analyses showed that overall, compared to the lowest quintile (Q1), the highest quintile (Q5) of fruit consumption was associated with a 40% lower odds for sarcopenia (OR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.42-0.84) but this association was largely driven by the strong association among females (e.g., Q5 vs. Q1 OR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.24-0.73), with no significant associations found among males.

Genetic vulnerability and characteristics of the neighborhood of residence form important risk factors for substance use. Possibly, these factors do not act in isolation. This study tested the interaction between neighborhood characteristics and genetic risk (gene-environment interaction, GxE) and the association between these classes of risk factors (gene-environment correlation, rGE) in substance use. Two polygenic scores (PGS) each (based on different discovery datasets) were created for smoking initiation, cigarettes per day, and glasses of alcohol per week based on summary statistics of different genome-wide association studies (GWAS). For cannabis initiation one PGS was created. These PGS were used to predict their respective phenotype in a large population-based sample from the Netherlands Twin Register (N&#x202f;=&#x202f;6,567). Neighborhood characteristics as retrieved from governmental registration systems were factor analyzed and resulting measures of socioeconomic status (SES) and metropolitanism were used as predictors. There were (small) main effects of neighborhood characteristics and PGS on substance use. One of the 14 tested GxE effects was significant, such that the PGS was more strongly associated with alcohol use in individuals with high SES. This was effect was only significant for one out of two PGS. There were weak indications of rGE, mainly with age and cohort covariates.

"32130430","Socioeconomic status and self-other processing: socioeconomic status predicts interference in the automatic imitation task.","Sumeet Farwaha, Sukhvinder S Obhi","High-status individuals have been found to be less attuned to the behaviour of others in the social environment, at least in the absence of any specific instructions to pay attention to them. Previous work using neural measures has shown that socioeconomic status (SES) influences the degree to which people are attuned to the actions of others. In particular, individuals from low-SES backgrounds were found to exhibit more mu-suppression, which has been suggested to reflect greater levels of sensorimotor resonance, compared to their high-SES counterparts. However, it is unclear whether such effects on brain activity translate into behaviour. Here, we examined differences in automatic imitation between high-SES and low-SES individuals. The automatic imitation task involves participants making actions in response to a numerical cue, while simultaneously being exposed to an action that is incongruent or congruent with the cued response. Patterns of interference effect reveal the extent to which the congruence of the observed action affects performance of the cued response. Interference thus indexes self-other processing, where high levels of interference suggest an increased susceptibility to the actions of others. Our results show that individuals from low-SES backgrounds exhibit more interference than individuals from high-SES backgrounds. Regression analyses revealed a negative relationship between SES and the degree of interference. Overall, our findings suggest that differences in SES are linked to differences in self-other processing, which could be relevant for broader behavioural tendencies exhibited by individuals at varying levels of a social structure.",2020,4,1,"Experimental brain research","10.1007/s00221-020-05761-7",NA,"Exp Brain Res","eng","D000328; D001288; D003463; D005260; D006801; D007100; D008297; D011597; D012923; D000083282; D012938; D055815","Adult; Attention; Cues; Female; Humans; Imitative Behavior; Male; Psychomotor Performance; Social Class; Social Cognition; Social Perception; Young Adult",NA,"NA",NA,"Neurosociety Lab, Department of Psychology, Neuroscience and Behaviour, McMaster University, Psychology Building (PC), Room 102, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON, L8S 4K1, Canada."

In this cross-sectional study, healthy Dutch children (2-18&#xa0;years) wore an actigraph (GT3x) for 7 consecutive days, collected first-morning void urine and completed a sleep log and sociodemographic questionnaire. Actigraphically estimated sleep variables were sleep onset latency (SOL), sleep efficiency (SE), total sleep time (TST), and wake after sleep onset (WASO). Non-parametric sleep-wake rhythm variables were intradaily variability (IV); interdaily stability (IS); the activity counts and timing of the least active 5-h period (L5counts and midpoint) and of the most active 10-h period (M10 counts and midpoint); and the relative amplitude (RA), i.e. the ratio of the difference and the sum of M10 and L5 counts. Finally, creatinine-corrected aMT6s levels were obtained by isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Effects of age group (preschool 2-5&#xa0;years/school-aged 6-12&#xa0;years/teenager 13-18&#xa0;years), sex, highest parental educational level and BMI (Z-scores) were explored. Ninety-four children participated, equally divided across age groups (53% boys). Teenagers slept less, but more efficiently, than younger children, while their 24&#xa0;h sleep-wake rhythm was the least stable and most fragmented (likely due to fragmentation of daytime activity). Additionally, aMT6s levels significantly declined over the age groups. Children from highly educated parents had lower sleep efficiency, but a more stable sleep-wake rhythm. Finally, sex or increase in BMI was not associated with any of the outcomes in this study. In conclusion, this study provides reference values of healthy children across different age groups and different sociodemographic factors. In the future, this information may help to better interpret outcomes in clinical populations.",2020,5,1,"Chronobiology international","10.1080/07420528.2020.1727916",NA,"Chronobiol Int","eng","D056044; D000293; D002648; D002675; D002940; D003430; D005260; D006801; D007231; D008297; D008550; D012890","Actigraphy; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Circadian Rhythm; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Melatonin; Sleep",NA,"NA",NA,"Princess M&#xe1;xima Center for Pediatric Oncology , Utrecht, The Netherlands."

The National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;8981) is used to classify children into 5 categories based on their family's pattern of SA use from age 4-5 to 10-11: always or never on SA, a single transition on or off SA, or fluctuations on and off SA. Latent growth modelling is used to compare trajectories of emotional and behavioural problems among children with different patterns of SA exposure to their counterparts never on SA over this same time period. Child emotional and behavioural problems are exacerbated over time in accordance with patterns of SA use: chronic SA use (behavioural) and moving onto SA (emotional and behavioural). These differential rates of change result in mental health disparities at age 10-11 that were not present at age 4-5. Children exposed to SA when they were age 4-5 but subsequently moved off continue to demonstrate elevated levels of emotional and behavioural problems at age 10-11. Successful social policies and interventions will require understanding the specific mechanisms through which SA undermines child mental health and how programs can be modified to reduce its negative consequences.

It has a high prevalence in those aged over age 40 years presenting with binocular diplopia. The authors aim to characterize the adnexal phenotype of those who have been diagnosed with SES. In this case-control study, patients were recruited from a prospectively maintained clinical and imaging database. The inclusion criteria required that subjects be above the age of 18 years and have a diagnosis of age-related distance esotropia or cyclovertical strabismus due to SES. Age-matched controls were selected from a validated database of normal faces that were not affected by any medical or surgical conditions. The margin to reflex distance from the upper eyelid, margin to reflex distance to the lower eyelid, the tarsal platform show, intracanthal distance, and inferior scleral bow were measured. Differences in the measurements between patients and controls were analyzed using a 2-tailed Student t tests. Twenty-two patients and 22 age-matched controls (11 males and 11 females per group) were included for study. Females with SES had a significantly greater margin to reflex distance to the lower eyelid and inferior scleral bow, with a lower tarsal platform show and margin to reflex distance from the upper eyelid than controls. Male patients with SES had a significantly greater margin to reflex distance to the lower eyelid and inferior scleral bow with a significantly lower margin to reflex distance from the upper eyelid and tarsal platform show than controls.

There exists a paucity of information on the health and injury experience of school-attending adolescents in Greenland. Consenting Greenlandic schoolchildren (<i>n</i> = 2,254) aged 9-19 years were included in the Health Behavior in School-Aged Children study 2005/2006. The aim of this study was to examine the socio-economic and behavioural correlates that were associated with injury occurrence among school-attending Greenlandic adolescents. This study made use of two multinomial regression models to examine injury occurrence regarding potential influencing factors such as physical activity, risk behaviours, bullying and family socio-economic status (SES). Those self-reporting 1-2 injuries within the recall period were more likely to be male (OR = 1.70; CI [1.39-2.09]), involved in physical fighting (OR = 1.82; CI [1.33-2.47]), bullied (OR = 1.81; CI [1.47-2.24]) and participated in bullying others (OR = 1.53; CI [1.25-1.89]). Those reporting three or more injuries were again mostly male (OR = 2.13; CI [1.44-3.14]), involved in physical fighting at higher rates (OR = 4.47; CI [2.86-7.01]), bullied more often (OR = 2.43; CI [1.65-3.57]) and were more likely to bully others (OR = 1.67; CI [1.13-2.45]). Living without a mother proved to be significantly correlated with suffering 3 or more injuries during the recall period (OR = 1.63; CI [1.05-2.52]). The study results support the idea that factors that were found to be associated with injury occurrence, such as bullying and aggressive behaviour, should be taken into account when conducting future research on the nature of injuries among Greenlandic adolescents.

The present study was conducted to explore the responsiveness and longitudinal validity of the Persian COMI (COMI-P) in patients with non-specific chronic LBP. Methods In this prospective cohort study of patients with non-specific chronic LBP receiving physiotherapy, patients completed a booklet containing the COMI-P, Persian Functional Rating Index (FRI-P), and a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain before and after the end of ten-sessions of physiotherapy. Patients also completed a global rating of change scale (GRCS) at the end of the physiotherapy. Responsiveness was examined by means of internal responsiveness methods [t-test, standard effect size (SES); standardized response mean (SRM), and Guyatt responsiveness index (GRI)] and external responsiveness methods [correlation with external criteria and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve]. Results Fifty patients with a mean age of 50.62&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;13.8 years participated. The paired t-test showed significant changes in COMI-P scores (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The effect sizes for COMI-P were large (range 0.96-1.23). The score changes for the COMI-P revealed significant correlations with FRI-P (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.67, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), the VAS (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.65, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and the GRCS (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.34, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). The COMI-P change scores showed excellent correlation with the dichotomized smallest detectable change (SDC) criterion (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.83, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The ROC area under the curve for the COMI-P based on the dichotomized SDC criterion was perfect. The minimal clinically important change was estimated 2.15 points (sensitivity 94% and specificity 100%). Conclusions The COMI-P appears to have responsiveness and longitudinal validity in detecting changes after physiotherapy for non-specific chronic LBP.

This study was based on cross-sectional data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS), and included 4 low-income, 13 lower middle-income, 9 upper middle-income, and 6 high-income countries. Data on past 7-day fast food consumption and 12-month suicide attempts were collected. The association between fast food consumption and suicide attempts was investigated with multivariable logistic regression and meta-analysis while adjusting for sex, age, food insecurity (proxy of socioeconomic status), alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, obesity, carbonated soft drink consumption, and fruit and vegetable consumption. Overall, the prevalence of fast food consumption was high (53.5%) and the proportion of suicide attempts was higher among consumers of fast food compared to non-consumers (11.8% vs. 8.3%). Of the 32 countries included in the study, a positive association between fast food consumption and suicide attempts was found in 26 countries although this was not statistically significant in all countries. The pooled OR (95% CI) based on a meta-analysis was 1.31 (1.17-1.46).

This study examined whether sociodemographic variations in the immune and inflammatory molecular underpinnings of chronic disease might emerge decades earlier in young adulthood. Using data from 1,069 young adults from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health)-the largest nationally representative and ethnically diverse sample with peripheral blood transcriptome profiles-we analyzed variation in the expression of genes involved in inflammation and type I interferon (IFN) response as a function of individual demographic factors, sociodemographic conditions, and biobehavioral factors (smoking, drinking, and body mass index). Differential gene expression was most pronounced by sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI), but transcriptome correlates were identified for every demographic dimension analyzed. Inflammation-related gene expression showed the most pronounced variation as a function of biobehavioral factors (BMI and smoking) whereas type I IFN-related transcripts varied most strongly as a function of individual demographic characteristics (sex and race/ethnicity). Bioinformatic analyses of transcription factor and immune-cell activation based on transcriptome-wide empirical differences identified additional effects of family poverty and geographic region.

Mental health research evidence translation into policymaking is a 'wicked problem', often failing despite a robust evidence base. In a recent systematic review, we identified a gap in frameworks on agenda setting and actionability, and pragmatic, effective tools to guide action to link research and policy are needed. Responding to this gap, we developed the new EVITA 1.1 (EVIdence To Agenda setting) conceptual framework for mental health research-policy interrelationships in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We (1) drafted a provisional framework (EVITA 1.0); (2) validated it for specific applicability to mental health; (3) conducted expert in-depth interviews to (a) validate components and mechanisms and (b) assess intelligibility, functionality, relevance, applicability and effectiveness. To guide interview validation, we developed a simple evaluation framework. (4) Using deductive framework analysis, we coded and identified themes and finalized the framework (EVITA 1.1). Theoretical agenda-setting elements were added, as targeting the policy agenda-setting stage was found to lead to greater policy traction. The framework was validated through expert in-depth interviews (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;13) and revised. EVITA 1.1 consists of six core components [advocacy coalitions, (en)actors, evidence generators, external influences, intermediaries and political context] and four mechanisms (capacity, catalysts, communication/relationship/partnership building and framing). EVITA 1.1 is novel and unique because it very specifically addresses the mental health research-policy process in LMICs and includes policy agenda setting as a novel, effective mechanism. Based on a thorough methodology, and through its specific design and mechanisms, EVITA has the potential to improve the challenging process of research evidence translation into policy and practice in LMICs and to increase the engagement and capacity of mental health researchers, policy agencies/planners, think tanks, NGOs and others within the mental health research-policy interface.

Various neuromodulatory techniques including electrical and pharmacological activation of the spinal networks have been successful in restoring locomotor function after SCI. We hypothesized that the combination of self-training in a natural environment with epidural stimulation (ES), quipazine (Quip), and strychnine (Strych) would result in greater activity in a cage environment after paralysis compared to either intervention alone. To assess this, we developed a method measuring and characterizing the chronic EMG recordings from tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (Sol) muscles while rats were freely moving in their home cages. We then assessed the relationship between the change in recorded activity over time and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in animals receiving treatments. We found that the combination of ES, Quip, and Strych (sqES) generated the greatest level of recovery followed by ES + Quip (qES) while ES + Strych (sES) and ES alone showed least improvement in recorded activity. Further, we observed an exponential relationship between late response (LR) component of the MEPs and spontaneously generated step-like activity. Our data demonstrate the feasibility and potential importance of quantitatively monitoring mechanistic factors linked to activity-dependence in response to combinatorial interventions compared to individual therapies after SCI.",2019,1,1,"Frontiers in systems neuroscience","10.3389/fnsys.2019.00082","PMC6974470","Front Syst Neurosci","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1038/387401a0; 10.1152/jappl.1984.56.6.1608; 10.1016/j.expneurol.2017.02.006; 10.1093/brain/awu038; 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2010.12.016; 10.1310/bqm5-6ygb-mvj5-wvcr; 10.1038/nature20118; 10.3758/bf03207645; 10.1038/nn.2401; 10.1016/s0079-6123(02)37013-4; 10.1152/jn.1999.82.1.359; 10.1097/JES.0b013e3181b7b932; 10.1523/jneurosci.1523-05.2005; 10.1038/s41593-018-0262-6; 10.1186/1743-0003-10-108; 10.1152/jn.00169.2013; 10.1152/jn.00918.2014; 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2007.01.008; 10.1186/s13036-017-0079-y; 10.1016/j.rehab.2015.05.003; 10.1016/j.expneurol.2007.07.015; 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2006.05.004; 10.1089/neu.2015.4008; 10.1038/s41591-018-0175-7; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60547-3; 10.1109/TBME.2008.2003293; 10.1088/1741-2560/7/5/056005; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1881-08.2008; 10.1016/j.neulet.2008.04.080; 10.1016/j.neulet.2005.04.049; 10.1523/jneurosci.0080-08.2008; 10.1152/jn.00325.2006; 10.1109/TBME.2008.915658; 10.3758/bf03201826; 10.1186/s12915-015-0154-0; 10.3758/bf03203196; 10.1016/0031-9384(85)90215-x; 10.1371/journal.pone.0211063; 10.1371/journal.pone.0181068; 10.1016/0031-9384(85)90175-1; 10.1146/annurev-neuro-061010-113746; 10.1007/s00421-010-1521-8; 10.1177/1545968314520721; 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2017.10.004; 10.1007/bf00316429; 10.1016/j.neucom.2016.12.088; 10.3791/50252; 10.1016/s0165-0270(96)00102-1",NA,"Faculty of Science, Centre for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."

Furthermore, previous research has yielded conflicting results. Thus, we investigated this association in adults from 38 LMICs. Data from the World Health Survey (WHS), a cross-sectional, predominantly nationally representative survey conducted in 2002-2004, were analyzed. PA was assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and participants were dichotomized into those who do (&#x2265;150&#xa0;min of moderate-to-vigorous PA per week) and do not (&lt;150&#xa0;min&#xa0;=&#xa0;low PA) comply with the World Health Organization PA recommendations. Those who provided help to a relative or friend (adult or child), because this person has a long-term physical or mental illness or disability, or is getting old and weak in the past year were considered to be informal caregivers. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the associations. There were 204,315 adults aged &#x2265;18&#xa0;years from 38 LMICs included in this study [mean (standard deviation) age 38.6 (16.1) years; 50.7% female]. Overall, the prevalence of caregiving and low PA was 19.5% and 29.9%, respectively. After adjustment for potential confounders, caregivers were at a lower risk for low PA compared to non-caregivers (OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.79; 95% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.72-0.86). Engagement in greater number of caregiving activities was associated with lower odds for low PA dose-dependently. Informal caregiving was associated with higher levels of PA in adults in LMICs.

"31997283","Is Receiving Social Support Costly for Those Higher in Subjective Socioeconomic Status?","Emily D Hooker, Belinda Campos, Lesa Hoffman, Peggy Zoccola, Sally S Dickerson","Although social support is generally thought to have positive consequences, this is not always the case. Receiving social support may threaten independence, which research has shown is more highly valued among those higher in socioeconomic status. As a result, support may be less strongly associated with positive outcomes for those higher in socioeconomic status (SES). Conversely, those lower in SES are more interdependent (Kraus, Piff, Mendoza-Denton, Rheinschmidt, &amp; Keltner, 2012; Stephens, Markus, &amp; Phillips, 2014) and may, therefore, be less threatened when receiving social support. This study examined SES as a moderator of how daily received support (within and between persons) predicted both daily psychological stressor appraisals and diurnal cortisol. Healthy undergraduate students (N = 128) participated in a 3-day study. Participants completed one or more evening diaries the first day of the study and additional questionnaires upon awakening, throughout the day, and at bedtime during the following 2 days. Support was measured each evening and stressor appraisals and cortisol were measured throughout the day. As expected, for those who reported higher subjective SES, receiving more support than usual (within-person support) was associated with a flatter pattern of diurnal cortisol the next day. Although SES did not moderate the association of either within- or between-person support with stressor appraisals, the receipt of more support on average (between-person support) was associated with higher reported resources to cope. The findings demonstrate that there may be physiological costs-but not psychological costs-associated with the receipt of support for those higher in socioeconomic status.",2020,6,1,"International journal of behavioral medicine","10.1007/s12529-019-09836-w",NA,"Int J Behav Med","eng","D000223; D000293; D002940; D005260; D006801; D006854; D008297; D012463; D012923; D012944; D013315; D055815","Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Circadian Rhythm; Female; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Male; Saliva; Social Class; Social Support; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult","President's Dissertation Year Fellowship; BCS-0720066; Harry and Miriam Levinson Scholarship","10.1037/0022-3514.92.3.458; 10.1177/1948550612451621; 10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00065-4; 10.1146/annurev-psych-010213-115143; 10.1037/a0028756; 10.1037/a0028480; 10.1177/0146167208323742; 10.1037/0022-3514.94.5.824; 10.1177/0146167203253473; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02388.x; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.01.038; 10.1037/0278-6133.27.2(Suppl.).S155; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316; 10.1037/0033-2909.98.2.310; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08103.x; 10.1037/0033-2909.130.3.355; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.05.018; 10.1210/jc.2010-2137; 10.1037/a0032671; 10.1037/amp0000122; 10.1037/a0020092; 10.1037/a0034273; 10.1037/a0016357; 10.1037/a0014726; 10.1017/S0140525X0999152X; 10.1037/0003-066X.64.8.663; 10.1177/1948550617732387; 10.1177/0956797615595962; 10.1016/j.copsyc.2017.05.005; 10.1177/0956797616667721; 10.1037/0278-6133.19.6.586; 10.4324/9781315744094; 10.1016/S0024-3205(01)00996-1; 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.03.014; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.10.010; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2009.06.011; 10.1016/j.bbi.2005.11.005; 10.1037/0022-3514.87.5.631; 10.1007/BF00922627; 10.1177/1359105312439731; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181c85712; 10.1037/hea0000398; 10.1007/s12529-011-9206-1; 10.1080/08870440310001638098",NA,"Department of Psychology, Pace University, New York City, NY, USA."

Previous studies have reported small negative associations between fluctuating body asymmetry and cognitive functioning, but relationships between fluctuating brain asymmetry and cognitive functioning remain unclear. The present study investigated the association between general intelligence (a latent factor derived from a factor analysis on 13 cognitive tests) and the fluctuating asymmetry of four structural measures of brain hemispheric asymmetry: cortical surface area, cortical volume, cortical thickness, and white matter fractional anisotropy. The sample comprised members of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936, <i>N</i>&#x202f;=&#x202f;636, mean age&#x202f;=&#x202f;72.9&#x202f;years). Two methods were used to calculate structural hemispheric asymmetry: in the first method, regions contributed equally to the overall asymmetry score; in the second method, regions contributed proportionally to their size. When regions contributed equally, cortical thickness asymmetry was negatively associated with general intelligence (<i>&#x3b2;</i>&#x202f;=&#x202f;-0.18,<i>p</i>&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;.001). There was no association between cortical thickness asymmetry and childhood SES, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved in the thickness asymmetry-intelligence association. Across all cortical metrics, asymmetry of regions identified by the parieto-frontal integration theory (P-FIT) was not more strongly associated with general intelligence than non-P-FIT asymmetry. When regions contributed proportionally, there were no associations between general intelligence and any of the asymmetry measures. The implications of these findings, and of different methods of calculating structural hemispheric asymmetry, are discussed.",2020,1,1,"Intelligence","10.1016/j.intell.2019.101407","PMC6961972","Intelligence","eng",NA,NA,"MR/R024065/1; MR/K026992/1; G0701120; MR/M013111/1; G1001245","NA",NA,"Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK."

Research, albeit limited, has focused predominantly on adults. There is a paucity of literature about stigma reduction strategies concerning children and adolescents, with evidence especially sparse for low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). This systematic review synthesised child-focused stigma reduction strategies in LMIC, and compared these to adult-focused interventions. Relevant publications were systematically searched in July and August 2018 in the following databases; Cochrane, Embase, Global Health, HMIC, Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed and WorldWideScience.org, and through Google Custom Search. Included studies and identified reviews were cross-referenced. Three categories of search terms were used: (i) stigma, (ii) intervention, and (iii) LMIC settings. Data on study design, participants and intervention details including strategies and implementation factors were extracted. Within 61 unique publications describing 79 interventions, utilising 14 unique stigma reduction strategies, 14 papers discussed 21 interventions and 10 unique strategies involving children. Most studies targeted HIV/AIDS (50% for children, 38% for adults) or mental illness (14% vs 34%) stigma. Community education (47%), individual empowerment (15%) and social contact (12%) were most employed in child-focused interventions. Most interventions were implemented at one socio-ecological level; child-focused interventions mostly employed community-level strategies (88%). Intervention duration was mostly short; between half a day and a week. Printed or movie-based material was key to deliver child-focused interventions (37%), while professionals most commonly implemented adult-focused interventions (53%). Ten unique, child-focused strategies were all evaluated positively, using a diverse set of scales. Children and adolescents are under-represented in stigma reduction in LMIC. More stigma reduction interventions in LMIC, addressing a wider variety of stigmas, with children as direct and indirect target group, are needed.

"31973173","The Association of Knowledge, Attitudes and Access with Park Use before and after a Park-Prescription Intervention for Low-Income Families in the U.S.","Nooshin Razani, Nancy K Hills, Doug Thompson, George W Rutherford","We conducted secondary data analyses of pooled data from a clinical trial that prescribed park visits to children and their caregivers in a low-income, urban setting. Data were collected at the prescribing visit (baseline) and at one and three months of follow up from 78 families. Family characteristics were identified at baseline; regression models were used to explore changes during follow up in associations of park use with knowledge, attitudes and perceived access to parks. At baseline, park users differed from non-users in demographics, knowledge of park locations, attitudes about the value of park visits, but not affinity for nature. Park users were also more likely than non-users to feel that their neighborhood was safe for children to play in. Changes in knowledge of park locations, nature affinity, and perceived access to parks were each significantly associated with increased park use by families at one and three months after the park prescription. Adjusting for age, gender, race, poverty, and US birth, increases in knowing the location of parks were associated with an increase of 0.27 weekly park visits (95% CI 0.05, 0.49; <i>p</i> = 0.016); increases in feeling a caregiver had money to visit parks were associated with 0.48 more weekly park visits (95% CI 0.28, 0.69; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001); increases in perceived money for park outings were associated with 0.24 increased park visits per week (95% CI 0.05, 0.42; <i>p</i> = 0.01); each unit increase in nature affinity was associated with 0.34 more weekly park visits (95% CI 0.09, 0.59; <i>p</i> = 0.007). In other words, knowing where to go, valuing nature, and having time, and money contributed to increased likelihood of visiting a park.

However, relatively little is known about whether the SES gradient in ECD outcomes varies by sex. This study examines whether the association between neighbourhood SES and developmental health outcomes of Canadian kindergarten children is different for girls than for boys. Individual-level child development data, collected using the Early Development Instrument (EDI), were combined with neighbourhood-level socioeconomic data from Statistics Canada's Census and Tax Filer databases. Using an SES index comprising 10 socioeconomic variables, we show a significant cross-level interaction between neighbourhood SES and sex in relation to children's developmental outcomes: the neighbourhood SES gradient in child outcomes is steeper for males than for females. This finding was consistent across all five developmental domains measured by the EDI, for overall developmental health, and across geographical regions in Canada. Further research using family-level SES data, data from multiple time points and countries, and qualitative studies would help to further contextualize the observed interactions.",2020,4,1,"SSM - population health","10.1016/j.ssmph.2019.100512","PMC6961754","SSM Popul Health","eng",NA,NA,NA,"NA","None.","Offord Centre for Child Studies, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West - MIP Suite 201A, L8S 4K1, Hamilton, ON, Canada."

This link may exist because malnutrition and infection, which are known to affect height and weight, also impact brain structure according to animal models. However, a relationship between anthropometric indicators and brain structural measures has not been tested yet, perhaps because stunting, underweight, and wasting are uncommon in higher-resource settings. Further, with diminished anthropometric growth prevalent in low-resource settings, where biological and psychosocial hazards are most severe, one might expect additional links between measures of poverty, anthropometry, and brain structure. To begin to examine these relationships, we conducted an MRI study in 2-3-month-old infants growing up in the extremely impoverished urban setting of Dhaka, Bangladesh. The sample size was relatively small because the challenges of investigating infant brain structure in a low-resource setting needed to be realized and resolved before introducing a larger cohort. Initially, fifty-four infants underwent T<sub>1</sub> sequences using 3T MRI, and resulting structural images were segmented into gray and white matter maps, which were carefully evaluated for accurate tissue labeling by a pediatric neuroradiologist. Gray and white matter volumes from 29 infants (79&#xa0;&#x200b;&#xb1;&#xa0;&#x200b;10 days-of-age; F/M&#xa0;&#x200b;=&#xa0;&#x200b;12/17), whose segmentations were of relatively high quality, were submitted to semi-partial correlation analyses with stunting, underweight, and wasting, which were measured using height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and weight-for-height (WHZ) scores. Positive semi-partial correlations (after adjusting for chronological age and sex and correcting for multiple comparisons) were observed between white matter volume and HAZ and WAZ; however, WHZ was not correlated with any measure of brain volume. No associations were observed between income-to-needs or maternal education and brain volumetric measures, suggesting that measures of poverty were not associated with total brain tissue volume in this sample. Overall, these results provide the first link between diminished anthropometric growth and white matter volume in infancy.

A community-based, controlled before-after study was conducted. People with probable SMI were identified in the community, diagnosed by primary healthcare workers, with diagnostic confirmation from a psychiatric nurse. Households of a person with SMI were matched to control households. District-wide integration of mental health care was implemented. Change in FI status over 12&#xa0;months of follow-up was measured using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale. Multivariable models were used to assess improvement in FI. Direct and indirect mediators of change in FI status were modelled using path analysis. A total of 239 (81.8%) people with SMI and 273 (96.5%) control households were assessed after 12&#xa0;months. Maintenance of food security or improvement in food insecurity status was observed in 51.5% of households of a person with SMI vs. 39.7% of control households (adjusted risk ratio 1.41: 95% CI 1.11, 1.80). Reduction in symptom severity was indirectly associated with improved FI status via an impact on reducing work impairment and discrimination (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). Improving access to mental health care may reduce food insecurity in households of people with SMI. Optimising engagement in care and adding interventions to improve work functioning and tackle discrimination may further reduce food insecurity.

Six focus groups were conducted among women with MDD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;69) who had been in treatment at a rural community health center. The discussion was transcribed and analyzed using a modified grounded-theory approach. Women perceived limited autonomy within their family structure, and experienced financial and systemic barriers as contributing to poor treatment access and non-adherence. Illiteracy, limited personal access to mobile phones, and preference for in-person clinical consultation were identified as barriers to use of mHealth.

The association of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage with brain volume in this context is not well known. To test whether neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with decreased brain volume in a cognitively unimpaired population enriched for Alzheimer disease risk. This study, conducted from January 6, 2010, to January 17, 2019, at an academic research neuroimaging center, used cross-sectional data on 951 participants from 2 large, ongoing cohort studies of Alzheimer disease (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention and Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center clinical cohort). Participants were cognitively unimpaired based on National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association workgroup diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease, confirmed through a consensus diagnosis panel. The cohort was enriched for Alzheimer disease risk based on family history of dementia. Statistical analysis was performed from April 3 to September 27, 2019. The Area Deprivation Index, a geospatially determined index of neighborhood-level disadvantage, and cardiovascular disease risk indices were calculated for each participant. Linear regression models were fitted to test associations between relative neighborhood-level disadvantage (highest 20% based on state of residence) and hippocampal and total brain tissue volume, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. In the primary analysis of 951 participants (637 women [67.0%]; mean [SD] age, 63.9 [8.1] years), living in the 20% most disadvantaged neighborhoods was associated with 4.1% lower hippocampal volume (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-317.44; 95% CI, -543.32 to -91.56; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.006) and 2.0% lower total brain tissue volume (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-20&#x202f;959.67; 95% CI, -37&#x202f;611.92 to -4307.43; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01), after controlling for intracranial volume, individual-level educational attainment, age, and sex. Robust propensity score-matched analyses determined that this association was not due to racial/ethnic or demographic characteristics. Cardiovascular risk score, examined in a subsample of 893 participants, mediated this association for total brain tissue but not for hippocampal volume. For cognitively unimpaired individuals, living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods was associated with significantly lower cerebral volumes, after controlling for maximal premorbid (total intracranial) volume. This finding suggests an association of community socioeconomic context, distinct from individual-level socioeconomic status, with brain volume during aging. Cardiovascular risk mediated this association for total brain tissue volume but not for hippocampal volume, suggesting that neighborhood-level disadvantage may be associated with these 2 outcomes via distinct biological pathways.",2020,4,1,"JAMA neurology","10.1001/jamaneurol.2019.4501","PMC6990953","JAMA Neurol","eng","D000368; D000544; D002540; D003430; D005260; D006624; D006801; D008279; D008297; D008875; D059906; D009929; D011203; D012307; D012959","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Cerebral Cortex; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging; Organ Size; Poverty; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors","R01 AG021155; R01 AG037639; P50 AG033514; T32 GM008692; R01 MD010243; F31 AG062116; RF1 AG027161; R56 AG037639; RF1 AG057784; R01 AG054059; P30 AG062715; R01 AG027161","10.1016/S1474-4422(13)70044-9; 10.1016/j.nicl.2018.06.023; 10.1016/S1474-4422(17)30077-7; 10.1001/jamaneurol.2017.0244; 10.1212/01.WNL.0000161871.83614.BB; 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00307; 10.1007/s00234-012-1005-0; 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2007.10.008; 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2010.09.023; 10.1001/archneurol.2007.27; 10.1093/arclin/acv041; 10.18865/ed.25.3.245; 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2018.04.002; 10.1016/j.psychres.2011.11.012; 10.1093/aje/kwh018; 10.1056/NEJMsa1103216; 10.1056/NEJMp1802313; 10.1177/1062860617753063; 10.2188/jea.JE20140117; 10.1136/jech-2015-205542; 10.1136/jech.52.6.399; 10.7326/M13-2946; 10.1161/STROKEAHA.111.622134; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.03.031; 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00277; 10.1097/WNR.0b013e328332bb09; 10.1038/srep29127; 10.1111/psyp.13025; 10.1016/S0006-3223(02)01359-8; 10.1016/j.ypmed.2017.09.017; 10.1111/pedi.12683; 10.2337/dc15-2800; 10.1161/01.HYP.0000132475.32317.bb; 10.1016/j.nicl.2014.05.020; 10.1016/j.nicl.2018.07.027; 10.1002/ana.22631; 10.1016/j.dadm.2017.11.007; 10.1016/j.jalz.2011.03.008; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.02.046; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.01.064; 10.1161/01.cir.0000437741.48606.98; 10.3174/ajnr.A4299; 10.18637/jss.v059.i05; 10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101904; 10.1001/archneur.1997.00550230066019; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.10.008; 10.1038/nn.2724; 10.2105/AJPH.2012.300865; 10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.12.016; 10.1038/npp.2015.171; 10.1038/nn.3983; 10.1371/journal.pone.0088969","<b>Conflict of Interest Disclosures:</b> Dr Jonaitis reported receiving grants from the National Institute on Aging and donations from the Lou Holland Fund that partially fund her position at the Wisconsin Alzheimer&#x2019;s Institute during the conduct of the study.

While much research has linked low birth weight to psychopathology, the intrauterine environment associated with high birth weight (macrosomia;&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;4000&#xa0;g) is also sub-optimal and may increase risk. Given the increasing prevalence of macrosomic births, understanding the mental health outcomes of infants born macrosomic can help refine theories of etiology, predict disorder, and target preventive interventions. Using data from the 2014 Ontario Child Health Study (OCHS), we examined the risk for psychiatric disorders in adolescents born macrosomic. Youth (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;2151) aged 12-17&#xa0;years completed the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID). Rates of common mental disorders assessed by the MINI-KID were compared between those born at normal birth weight (NBW; 2500-4000&#xa0;g, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1817) and adolescents born macrosomic (&gt;&#x2009;4000&#xa0;g, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;334). These associations were then adjusted for participant age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES) of the family, parental mental health, and gestational diabetes mellitus. After adjustment for covariates, adolescents born macrosomic had higher odds of conduct disorder (CD; OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.19, 95% CI: 1.37-7.43), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD; OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.79, 95% CI: 1.11-2.91), and ADHD (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.77, 95% CI: 1.21-2.80). Moderation analyses revealed that males born macrosomic were more likely to have psychiatric problems than their female peers. Socioeconomic disadvantage also amplified the risk posed by macrosomia for ODD, ADHD, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. In this study, macrosomia was associated with an increased risk of clinically significant externalizing problems in adolescence, most notably among boys and those facing socioeconomic disadvantage.",2020,11,1,"European child &amp; adolescent psychiatry","10.1007/s00787-019-01466-7",NA,"Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry","eng","D000293; D002648; D005260; D005320; D006801; D008297; D001523; D011247; D012307","Adolescent; Child; Female; Fetal Macrosomia; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Pregnancy; Risk Factors","125941; 8-42298","NA",NA,"School of Epidemiology &amp; Public Health, University of Ottawa, 600 Peter Morand Cr, Room 308C, Ottawa, ON, K1G 5Z3, Canada."

At the start of its third phase (2016-2021) the target group of the campaign was kept as people aged between mid-twenties and mid-forties but changed to middle-low income groups and the content was focused on men. Participants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3700) were recruited through an online market research panel, before and after each burst of the campaign. They completed an online questionnaire evaluating knowledge (Mental Health Knowledge Schedule, MAKS); attitudes (Community Attitudes toward Mental Illness, CAMI); and desire for social distance (Intended Behaviour subscale of the Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale, RIBS). Socio-demographic data and awareness of the campaign were also collected. For each of the 3 bursts, significant pre-post awareness differences were found (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.83, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.90-4.20, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.72, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.22-2.42, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002; OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.41, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.01-1.97, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.043), and awareness at the end of the third burst was 33%. Demographic factors associated with awareness for one or more bursts included having children, familiarity with mental illness, male sex, being Black, Asian or other ethnic minorities and living in London or the East Midlands regions. An improvement across bursts in the ""living with"" subscale item of the RIBS, and in the ""recover"" and ""advice to a friend"" MAKS items were found. Familiarity with mental illness had the strongest association with all outcome measures, while the awareness of the campaign was also related with higher scores in MAKS and RIBS. These interim results suggest that the campaign is reaching and having an impact on its new target audience to a similar extent as did the TTC phase 1 campaign. While over the course of TTC we have found no evidence that demographic differences in stigma have widened, and indeed those by age group and region of England have narrowed, those for socioeconomic status, ethnicity and sex have so far remained unchanged. By targeting a lower socioeconomic group and creating relatively greater awareness among men and in Black and ethnic minority groups, the campaign is showing the potential to address these persistent differences in stigma.",2019,12,27,"BMC psychiatry","10.1186/s12888-019-2415-x","PMC6933720","BMC Psychiatry","eng","D000328; D005006; D005260; D007722; D006801; D008131; D008297; D001523; D008875; D008913; D011203; D015397; D012737; D040241; D057545","Adult; Ethnicity; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; London; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Minority Groups; Poverty; Program Evaluation; Sex Factors; Social Marketing; Social Stigma","-","10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.09.030; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2015.10.005; 10.1176/appi.ps.201100529; 10.1055/s-0029-1220386; 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61046-1; 10.1016/j.cpr.2010.06.004; 10.1192/bjp.bp.106.025791; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2016.08.008; 10.1192/bjp.bp.113.126672; 10.1017/S0033291718003677; 10.1037/0022-3514.90.5.751; 10.1037/a0032603; 10.1177/1368430210387805; 10.1027/0227-5910/a000517; 10.1017/S2045796011000308; 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02289; 10.1176/appi.ps.201700478; 10.1192/bjp.bp.114.151944","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."

This study aimed to determine early-onset epilepsy incidence using a comprehensive case identification strategy, and examined socioeconomic status (SES) and ethnicity as risk factors. Through a prospective, population-based study, newly diagnosed CWEOE from Fife and Lothian, Scotland, were identified using multiple-source, active surveillance capture-recapture between May 2013 and June 2015. Crude, ascertainment-adjusted, age-adjusted, age- and gender-specific, and epilepsy-type incidence rates were determined. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated to examine SES and ethnicity as risk factors. 59 (36 Male) CWEOE were identified. Ascertainment was 98% (95% CI 94-103). Crude annual incidence of epilepsy in children 0-59 months was 60.2 (95% CI 44.8-75.5) per 100,000 per year; ascertainment-adjusted annual incidence was 61.7 (95% CI 46.2-77.3) per year. Cumulative incidence of West Syndrome/Infantile Spasms was 6.7 per 10,000 live births (95% CI 3.6-12.3). Aetiology was unknown in almost two-thirds of CWEOE. Compared to White-British Isles (BI) children, Asian children (RR 2.6 [95% CI 1.2-5.7], p = .02) and White-non-BI children (RR 2.5 [95% CI 1.2-5.2], p = .02) had increased risk. SES was not a risk factor. The high incidence of early-onset epilepsy is similar to previous studies and demonstrates a substantial disease burden.

Suicide rates were calculated for 100,000 individuals. <i>Results:</i> The suicide rate was 51.2 per 100,000 among unaccompanied minors/youth, which compares to 6.1 per 100,000 in the host population. Characteristics of asylum seekers who died by suicide were: male gender (100%) and from Afghanistan (83%). Hanging was the predominant method (60%). <i>Limitations:</i> As estimation of an exact population of asylum seekers is difficult; we overestimated the number of individuals in the population of asylum seekers, resulting in an underestimation of their suicide rates. <i>Conclusion:</i> The suicide rate in unaccompanied minors/youth seeking asylum in 2017 in Sweden can be regarded as very high.

Having at least one prescription written by a neurologist in the study period was more common in the high-income and high-education groups. Finally, although low educational attainment was associated with low levels of income and inversely associated with employment in both persons with epilepsy and controls, regression analyses demonstrated that these associations were much more noticeable in cases than controls. We conclude that both the severity and consequences of epilepsy are greater in persons of low SES, even in a country with universal health care. This indicates that universal access may not be sufficient to mitigate socioeconomic inequity in epilepsy.",2020,1,1,"Seizure","10.1016/j.seizure.2019.12.001",NA,"Seizure","eng","D000328; D000368; D000369; D015331; D003430; D004651; D004827; D005260; D006297; D006801; D007182; D008297; D008875; D012042; D012959; D013548","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Employment; Epilepsy; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Income; Male; Middle Aged; Registries; Socioeconomic Factors; Sweden",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; Department of Neurology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden."
"31831269","Predictors of activities and participation six months after mild traumatic brain injury in children and adolescents.","M Irene Renaud, Suzanne A M Lambregts, Ingrid G L van de Port, Coriene E Catsman-Berrevoets, Caroline M van Heugten","This study aimed to identify predictors of long-term consequences for activities and participation in children and adolescents with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). A multicentre prospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted. The primary outcome measure was activities and participation measured with the Child and Adolescent Scale of Participation - CASP and completed by children (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;156) and caregivers (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;231) six months post-mTBI. The CASP items were categorized into home, community, school, and environment. Predictors were categorized according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth. Predictors included pre-injury personal- and environmental factors, injury-related factors, symptoms, and resumption of activities in the first two weeks after mTBI. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the predictive value of these factors. Results show that predictors differ across settings and perspectives (child or caregiver). Decreased activities and participation in children with mTBI can be predicted by adverse pre-injury behavioral functioning of the child (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.000 - p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.038), adverse pre-injury family functioning (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.001), lower parental SES (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.038), more stress symptoms post-injury (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.017 - p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.032), more post-concussive symptoms (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.016 - p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.028) and less resumption of activities (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.006 - p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.045). Pre-injury factors, more symptoms post-injury and less resumption of activities should be considered when children are screened for unfavorable outcomes. Additional factors may add to the prediction, but injury-related factors do not. It is recommended that future research explores psychosocial factors, such as coping styles, emotion-regulation, personality traits, social support, and other comorbid problems of both children and caregivers.",2020,3,1,"European journal of paediatric neurology : EJPN : official journal of the European Paediatric Neurology Society","10.1016/j.ejpn.2019.11.008",NA,"Eur J Paediatr Neurol","eng","D000293; D001924; D002648; D015331; D005260; D006801; D008137; D008297; D011446; D020127; D058992","Adolescent; Brain Concussion; Child; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Prospective Studies; Recovery of Function; Social Participation",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Neuropsychology and Psychopharmacology, Maastricht University, Maastricht, the Netherlands; Limburg Brain Injury Center, Maastricht, the Netherlands; School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Maastricht University Medical Centre, Maastricht, the Netherlands."
"31816149","Neurostructural correlates of optimism: Gray matter density in the putamen predicts dispositional optimism in late adolescence.","Han Lai, Song Wang, Yajun Zhao, Chen Qiu, Qiyong Gong","Dispositional optimism reflects one's generalized positive expectancies for future outcomes and plays a crucial role in personal developmental outcomes and health (e.g., counteracting related mental disorders such as depression and anxiety). Increasing evidence has suggested that extraversion is an important personality factor contributing to dispositional optimism. However, less is known about the association between dispositional optimism and brain structure and the role of extraversion in this association. Here, we examined these issues in 231 healthy high school students aged 16 to 20&#x2009;years (110 males, mean age = 18.48&#x2009;years, SD = 0.54) by estimating regional gray matter density (rGMD) using a voxel-based morphometry method via structural magnetic resonance imaging. Whole-brain regression analyses revealed a significant positive correlation between dispositional optimism and the rGMD of the bilateral putamen after adjusting for age, sex, family socioeconomic status (SES), general intelligence, and total gray matter volume (TGMV). Moreover, prediction analyses using fourfold balanced cross-validation combined with linear regression confirmed a significant connection between dispositional optimism and putamen density after adjusting for age, sex, and family SES. More importantly, subsequent mediation analysis showed that extraversion may account for the association between putamen density and dispositional optimism after adjusting for age, sex, family SES, general intelligence, TGMV, and the other four Big Five personality traits. Taken together, the current study provides new evidence regarding the neurostructural basis underlying dispositional optimism in adolescents and underscores the importance of extraversion as an essential personality factor for dispositional optimism acquisition.",2020,4,15,"Human brain mapping","10.1002/hbm.24888","PMC7267983","Hum Brain Mapp","eng","D000293; D001007; D044466; D001931; D003863; D005120; D005260; D066128; D006801; D008279; D008297; D009483; D000067656; D010551; D000297; D011699; D015203; D012959; D013334; D055815","Adolescent; Anxiety; Asian People; Brain Mapping; Depression; Extraversion, Psychological; Female; Gray Matter; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Optimism; Personality; Psychology, Adolescent; Putamen; Reproducibility of Results; Socioeconomic Factors; Students; Young Adult",NA,"10.1002/hbm.24684; 10.1093/cercor/bhz080","The authors declare no competing interests.","Huaxi MR Research Center (HMRRC), Department of Radiology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China."

Cross-sectional. Large multi-site health system in Metro Detroit. A total of 267 pregnant women (27.3% non-Hispanic black; gestational age: 27.99&#xb1;1.20 weeks) completed online surveys on sleep quality, insomnia symptoms, sleep aid use, signs/symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing, and sociodemographics. Body mass index (BMI) and patient insurance were derived from medical records. As high as 76.2% of the women reported global sleep disturbance, 30.6% endorsed snoring, 24.3% sleep &lt;6 hrs/night, and over half screened positive for clinical insomnia. Yet, only 3.4% of the women reported an insomnia diagnosis and 3.0% reported a sleep apnea diagnosis. In unadjusted models, poverty, Medicaid coverage, self-identifying as black, and obesity before and during pregnancy (BMI &#x2265; 35) were associated with a wide range of sleep problems. However, adjusted models revealed specificity. Poverty was uniquely related to increased insomnia symptoms and trouble sleeping due to bad dreams. Obesity before pregnancy was related to poor sleep quality, snoring, sleep aids, and short sleep. Black women reported shorter sleep duration than white women but differed on no other sleep parameters. Clinical signs of insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing are common in mid-to-late pregnancy, but most cases go undetected. Problematic sleep disproportionately affects women in poverty, who self-identify as black, and who are obese before pregnancy. Poverty-related sleep issues are linked to insomnia, obesity-related disparities center on sleep-related breathing and medication use, and racial disparities relate to short sleep.",2019,1,1,"Nature and science of sleep","10.2147/NSS.S226291","PMC6839586","Nat Sci Sleep","eng",NA,NA,"K23 HL122461","10.1016/j.sleep.2014.12.006; 10.1186/1471-2393-12-144; 10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181c4f8ec; 10.1186/1471-2393-14-15; 10.5665/sleep.3112; 10.1136/thoraxjnl-2012-202718; 10.1097/AOG.0000000000001805; 10.1111/j.1552-6909.2000.tb02072.x; 10.1177/1753495X15600572; 10.1016/j.sleep.2014.02.013; 10.1002/da.20828; 10.1177/1933719107307647; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e31829cc3e7; 10.1016/j.sleep.2019.01.009; 10.1371/journal.pone.0094674; 10.1089/jwh.2010.2371; 10.1016/j.sleep.2019.07.010; 10.1111/1471-0528.12885; 10.1186/1471-2393-13-174; 10.1093/sleep/27.7.1405; 10.1186/1471-2458-10-475; 10.1016/j.sleep.2009.10.006; 10.1016/j.annepidem.2007.07.096; 10.5665/sleep.6306; 10.5665/sleep.3508; 10.1016/j.sleep.2015.01.011; 10.1093/sleep/30.9.1096; 10.1164/ajrccm.163.3.9911064; 10.1016/j.ajog.2009.10.867; 10.1136/jech.2009.096297; 10.1016/S0033-3549(04)50068-7; 10.1093/jurban/jti061; 10.1093/sleep/34.5.601; 10.1016/0165-1781(89)90047-4; 10.1016/s0022-3999(97)00298-5; 10.1097/00002060-200105000-00003; 10.1093/sleep/zsy024; 10.1080/02699050110103940; 10.1016/j.smrv.2012.09.005; 10.5664/jcsm.2990; 10.1378/chest.15-0903; 10.5665/sleep.4338; 10.1016/j.ajog.2018.01.031; 10.1055/s-0031-1299721; 10.1378/chest.120.5.1442; 10.1016/0002-9343(90)90282-I; 10.7326/0003-4819-134-5-200103060-00012","Dr. Kalmbach has received research support from Merck &amp; Co.

"31804434","Two Methods for Calculating Symptom Cluster Scores.","Rebecca E Salomon, Jamie Crandell, Keely A Muscatell, Hudson P Santos, Ruth A Anderson, Linda S Beeber","Symptom clusters are conventionally distilled into a single score using composite scoring, which is based on the mathematical assumption that all symptoms are equivalently related to outcomes of interest; this may lead to a loss of important variation in the data. This article compares two ways of calculating a single score for a symptom cluster: a conventional, hypothesis-driven composite score versus a data-driven, reduced rank regression score that weights the symptoms based on their individual relationships with key outcomes. We conducted a secondary analysis of psychoneurological symptoms from a sample of 356 low-income mothers. Four of the psychoneurological symptoms (fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbance, and depressed mood) were measured with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; the fifth (pain) was measured using an item from the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). Mothers' function was measured using the 12-item Short Form Health Survey. The composite score was calculated by summing standardized scores for each individual psychoneurological symptom. In contrast, reduced rank regression weighted the individual symptoms using their respective associations with mothers' function; the weighted individual symptom scores were summed into the reduced rank regression symptom score. The composite score and reduced rank regression score were highly correlated at .93. The cluster of psychoneurological symptoms accounted for 53.7% of the variation in the mothers' function. Depressed mood and pain accounted for almost all the explained variation in mothers' function at 37.2% and 15.0%, respectively. The composite score approach was simpler to calculate, and the high correlation with the reduced rank regression score indicates that the composite score reflected most of the variation explained by the reduced rank regression approach in this data set. However, the reduced rank regression analysis provided additional information by identifying pain and depressed mood as having the strongest association with a mother's function, which has implications for understanding which symptoms to target in future interventions. Future studies should also explore composite versus reduced rank regression approaches given that reduced rank regression may yield different insights in other data sets.",2020,1,1,"Nursing research","10.1097/NNR.0000000000000412","PMC7050366","Nurs Res","eng","D010054; D060825; D003863; D005221; D005260; D006801; D008875; D015233; D009035; D010146; D011203; D011788; D012893; D011795","Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; Cognitive Dysfunction; Depression; Fatigue; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Mothers; Pain; Poverty; Quality of Life; Sleep Wake Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires","F31 NR017106; T32 NR007091; T32 NR016920","10.1136/bmj.314.7085.932; 10.1188/03.ONF.601-606; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08111.x; 10.1097/01.ANS.0000286621.77139.f0; 10.1002/nur.20363; 10.1196/annals.1425.008; 10.1097/NNR.0b013e31828324c2; 10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031210-101218; 10.1016/j.outlook.2016.05.008; 10.1016/j.outlook.2015.03.001; 10.1016/j.jpain.2019.04.004; 10.1016/j.ejon.2009.09.005; 10.1037/0033-2909.108.1.50; 10.1016/j.yfrne.2018.03.001; 10.1016/j.jpain.2005.10.010; 10.1016/j.ejpain.2005.01.002; 10.1017/S0954579407070289; 10.1176/ajp.144.6.736; 10.1093/aje/kwh134; 10.1016/0047-259X(75)90042-1; 10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2014.12.014; 10.1097/NCC.0b013e318233a811; 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2007.11.011; 10.1016/j.ejon.2019.08.005; 10.2105/AJPH.2011.300210; 10.1038/ejcn.2014.96; 10.1037/dev0000062; 10.1037/1082-989X.4.1.84; 10.1097/00012272-200510000-00004; 10.1177/1099800411424204; 10.1093/jnci/djw253; 10.1037/0022-006X.74.1.99; 10.17226/21868; 10.1177/014662167700100306; 10.1007/s00520-016-3400-2; 10.4236/abcr.2013.24018; 10.1111/pcn.12529; 10.1080/14616730801900712; 10.2307/3766749; 10.1186/s12884-016-1050-5; 10.1097/AJP.0000000000000157","The authors have no conflicts of interest to report.","Rebecca E.

The purpose of this review is to provide practitioners with a comprehensive summary of foundational and recent research on the ways that children's early experiences-both favorable and adverse-may influence the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology underlying language development. A specific focus is given to the burgeoning neuroimaging evidence of relationships between socioeconomic status (SES) and brain development, as well as to emerging research on proximal experiences that may serve as the direct mechanisms by which SES influences language development. Findings from the neuroscience field have direct implications for practice in speech language pathology.

To determine the degree of impoverishment of people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and their families in Bangladesh caused by loss of work-related income following injury. Spinal cord injury centre, Bangladesh. A total of 410 wheelchair-dependent people with recent SCI about to be discharged from a hospital in Bangladesh were interviewed to determine the size of their families, their incomes from paid work prior to injury and the incomes of their family members. These data were used to calculate income per family unit and per family member prior to and immediately after injury. Ninety percent of the participants were men, 98% were from rural areas of Bangladesh and 58% were manual labours prior to injury. Median (interquartile range, IQR) family size was 5 (4-6) people. Prior to injury, 74% of participants were the main income earners for their families and 50% provided the only source of income for their families. Participants' median (IQR) monthly income prior to injury was US$106 (US$60-US$180) per person and family members' income was US$30 (US$19-US$48) per person. After injury, the median income (IQR) of each family member dropped to US$0 (US$0-US$18) placing 91% of families below the extreme poverty line of US$37.50 per person per month (equivalent to US$1.25 per day).

There is a paucity of research using neuroimaging tools in conjunction with sensitive behavioral assays in low-income settings, which has hindered researchers' ability to explain how stunting impacts brain and behavioral development. We employed high-density EEG to examine associations among children's physical growth, brain functional connectivity (FC), and cognitive development. We recruited participants from an urban impoverished neighborhood in Dhaka, Bangladesh. One infant cohort consisted of 92 infants whose height (length) was measured at 3, 4.5, and 6&#x2009;months; EEG data were collected at 6&#x2009;months; and cognitive outcomes were assessed using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning at 27&#x2009;months. A second, older cohort consisted of 118 children whose height was measured at 24, 30, and 36&#x2009;months; EEG data were collected at 36&#x2009;months; and Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores were assessed at 48&#x2009;months. Height-for-age (HAZ) z-scores were calculated based on the World Health Organization standard. EEG FC in different frequency bands was calculated in the cortical source space. Linear regression and longitudinal path analysis were conducted to test the associations between variables, as well as the indirect effect of child growth on cognitive outcomes via brain FC. In the older cohort, we found that HAZ was negatively related to brain FC in the theta and beta frequency bands, which in turn was negatively related to children's IQ score at 48&#x2009;months. Longitudinal path analysis showed an indirect effect of HAZ on children's IQ via brain FC in both the theta and beta bands. There were no associations between HAZ and brain FC or cognitive outcomes in the infant cohort. The association observed between child growth and brain FC may reflect a broad deleterious effect of malnutrition on children's brain development. The mediation effect of FC on the relation between child growth and later IQ provides the first evidence suggesting that brain FC may serve as a neural pathway by which biological adversity impacts cognitive development.",2019,11,25,"BMC medicine","10.1186/s12916-019-1431-5","PMC6876085","BMC Med","eng","D001459; D002675; D003071; D015331; D004569; D005260; D006130; D006801; D007223; D016014; D008297; D011203; D014944","Bangladesh; Child, Preschool; Cognition; Cohort Studies; Electroencephalography; Female; Growth Disorders; Humans; Infant; Linear Models; Male; Poverty; World Health Organization","R01 AI043596","10.1111/nure.12102; 10.1177/15648265150361S103; 10.3945/ajcn.115.123968; 10.1111/jcpp.12000; 10.1002/hbm.21030; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.06.003; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.09.053; 10.1038/s41398-019-0380-2; 10.1016/j.cortex.2019.03.005; 10.1038/s41593-018-0128-y; 10.1186/1866-1955-6-40; 10.1016/0887-8994(93)90025-8; 10.1176/appi.ajp.157.7.1170; 10.1093/jn/136.6.1570; 10.1016/S0149-7634(05)80234-9; 10.1093/jn/128.7.1224; 10.1111/mcn.12080; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61692-4; 10.1542/peds.2009-1519; 10.1126/science.1143921; 10.1038/547150a; 10.1002/hbm.20745; 10.1080/15248372.2012.691143; 10.1016/j.bbr.2008.08.049; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2019.0492; 10.1016/S2352-4642(17)30024-X; 10.1111/mcn.12584; 10.4269/ajtmh.14-0518; 10.1371/journal.pone.0215304; 10.1093/ije/dyr176; 10.1289/ehp.1104431; 10.1111/desc.12703; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.04.055; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.09.031; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.01.055; 10.1111/desc.12562; 10.1016/j.clinph.2015.03.004; 10.1093/cercor/bhy012; 10.3329/jhpn.v28i1.4520; 10.1016/S0165-0173(98)00056-3; 10.1073/pnas.1019676108; 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2013.05.007; 10.1038/nn.3641; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2272-17.2018; 10.1002/hbm.23645; 10.1016/j.bandc.2009.10.003; 10.1016/S1388-2457(02)00163-3; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60555-2; 10.1038/nn.3983; 10.1016/j.neuron.2017.09.027; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.011; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116110","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Labs of Cognitive Neuroscience, Division of Developmental Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, USA."

The study utilized data on 2,176 school-attending adolescents aged 11-16 years in Dar es Salaam (DES) to examine social and behavioral correlates for lifetime substance use. The correlates under investigation included, demographic - age and gender; social - poverty, parent-adolescent relationship; behavioral - truancy, aggressive behavior, injury risk; psychological - depression and suicide ideation. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were then carried out on several variables identified from the 2006 Tanzanian Global School-based Health Survey (GSHS) questionnaire. Approximately seven percent of school-attending adolescents (n=144) reported having used an illicit substance at least once during their lifetime. After adding significantly associated covariates into a logistic regression model, we found that only truancy [OR= 2.29 (CI=1.07 - 4.90)], suicide ideation [OR=4.36 (2.32 - 8.19)] and parents who had checked their adolescents' homework (OR=0.56 (CI=0.32 - 1.00)] were significantly associated with reported substance use. Our results suggest that health promotion programs should simultaneously target multiple factors associated with substance use behaviors among school-attending adolescents in Dar es Salaam. They should take into account the range of psychosocial characteristics of school-attending adolescents which may be impacted by or result from substance use.",2020,1,1,"Journal of injury &amp; violence research","10.5249/jivr.v12i1.1195","PMC7001609","J Inj Violence Res","eng","D000293; D000294; D002648; D005260; D015438; D006801; D008297; D011203; D012309; D012944; D019966; D059020; D013636","Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Child; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Poverty; Risk-Taking; Social Support; Substance-Related Disorders; Suicidal Ideation; Tanzania",NA,"NA","<b>Ethical approval:</b> Used GSHS 2006 data; additional ethical approval not required.","Injury Epidemiology and Prevention Research Group, Turku Brain Injury Center, Division of Clinical Neurosciences, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku, Finland.

"31758750","Predicting educational achievement from genomic measures and socioeconomic status.","Sophie von Stumm, Emily Smith-Woolley, Ziada Ayorech, Andrew McMillan, Kaili Rimfeld, Philip S Dale, Robert Plomin","The two best predictors of children's educational achievement available from birth are parents' socioeconomic status (SES) and, recently, children's inherited DNA differences that can be aggregated in genome-wide polygenic scores (GPS). Here, we chart for the first time the developmental interplay between these two predictors of educational achievement at ages 7, 11, 14 and 16 in a sample of almost 5,000 UK school children. We show that the prediction of educational achievement from both GPS and SES increases steadily throughout the school years. Using latent growth curve models, we find that GPS and SES not only predict educational achievement in the first grade but they also account for systematic changes in achievement across the school years. At the end of compulsory education at age 16, GPS and SES, respectively, predict 14% and 23% of the variance of educational achievement. Analyses of the extremes of GPS and SES highlight their influence and interplay: In children who have high GPS and come from high SES families, 77% go to university, whereas 21% of children with low GPS and from low SES backgrounds attend university. We find that the associations of GPS and SES with educational achievement are primarily additive, suggesting that their joint influence is particularly dramatic for children at the extreme ends of the distribution.",2020,5,1,"Developmental science","10.1111/desc.12925","PMC7187229","Dev Sci","eng","D000076363; D000293; D002648; D004522; D005260; D023281; D006801; D008297; D020412; D012574; D012923; D006113","Academic Success; Adolescent; Child; Educational Status; Female; Genomics; Humans; Male; Multifactorial Inheritance; Schools; Social Class; United Kingdom","G19/2; MR/M021475/1; 295366; AG046938; 602768; G0901245; R01 AG046938","10.1073/pnas.1801238115; 10.1177/0956797616643070; 10.1093/sf/sot076; 10.1016/j.tine.2015.06.001; 10.1016/j.intell.2018.11.006; 10.1371/journal.pone.0016006; 10.1080/00220973.1948.11010388; 10.1016/S2352-4642(17)30024-X; 10.1038/mp.2015.2; 10.1038/s41588-018-0147-3; 10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163612; 10.1038/s42003-018-0261-x; 10.1038/nrg.2017.104; 10.1038/ng.3285; 10.1038/s41539-018-0030-0; 10.1017/thg.2019.56; 10.1038/mp.2016.107; 10.1016/j.intell.2006.09.004; 10.1007/BF01065905; 10.1177/0956797615612727; 10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.09.001; 10.1016/j.intell.2016.11.006; 10.1136/bmjopen-2013-002772",NA,"Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."

AUD is especially pronounced among men, leading to negative consequences at both individual and family levels. This study examines the experiences of problem-drinking fathers in Kenya regarding previous treatment-seeking related to alcohol use. Experiences and dynamics of the family are also explored as they pertain to treatment-seeking experiences. In Eldoret, Kenya, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 11 families with a male exhibiting problem drinking, his spouse, and one child. Thematic content analysis was used to examine themes related to barriers and facilitators to treatment. Participants only reported informal help received from family and community members; they exhibited little awareness of available formal treatments. Families were both deeply affected by alcohol use and actively involved in help-seeking. Indeed, fathers' experiences are described as help-accepting rather than help-seeking. Three overarching themes emerged from the results: poverty, people, and practices. Poverty could be a motivator to accept help to support one's family financially, but stress from lack of work also drove drinking behaviours. People were also crucial as both barriers and facilitators of help-accepting. Negative help strategies or peer influence deterred fathers from accepting help to quit. Positive motivation, social support, and stigma against drinking were motivators. Practices that were culturally salient, such as religiosity and gender roles, facilitated help acceptance. Overall, most help efforts were short-term and only lead to very short-term behaviour change. Families and communities are active in help provision for problem-drinking men in Kenya, though results confirm remaining need for effective interventions. Future interventions could benefit from recognizing the role of family to aid in treatment-engagement and attending to the importance of poverty, people, and practices in designing treatment strategies.",2020,1,1,"The International journal on drug policy","10.1016/j.drugpo.2019.10.003","PMC7050447","Int J Drug Policy","eng","D000328; D000428; D000437; D002648; D005192; D005220; D005260; D006801; D007407; D007630; D008297; D009042; D010342; D011203; D057545; D012944","Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholism; Child; Family Health; Fathers; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Kenya; Male; Motivation; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Poverty; Social Stigma; Social Support","F32 MH113288; T32 MH096724","10.1371/journal.pmed.1000170; 10.1001/archinte.158.16.1789; 10.1177/002204260803800302; 10.1111/dar.12417; 10.1080/15660970412331292342; 10.1080/17441692.2014.921829; 10.1037/a0013459; 10.1080/08897070903442640; 10.1093/aje/kwq304; 10.1093/eurjhf/hfp037; 10.1080/01488376.2012.744618; 10.1037/0893-164X.18.2.113; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.04.016; 10.1177/1524838014523336; 10.1016/S0264-2751(03)00034-9; 10.1186/1747-597X-5-28; 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31590-2; 10.1081/ADA-200068459; 10.1016/j.cpr.2015.04.004; 10.1016/S0376-8716(00)00239-8; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61240-9; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000160; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.02899.x; 10.1016/j.aogh.2014.04.010; 10.1016/j.jsat.2006.01.003; 10.1017/gmh.2017.25; 10.1093/ije/dyu038; 10.1016/S0740-5472(03)00209-5; 10.1046/j.1360-0443.2000.95225112.x","Declaration: The authors report no conflicts of interest","Duke Global Health Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA; Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA."

Importantly, the extent to which cannabis use is associated with PA in adolescents is yet to be explored in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where there may be unique sociodemographic and environmental characteristics compared with high-income countries. Therefore, this study examined the association between PA and cannabis use among adolescents in 21 LMICs using data from the 2010-2016 Global School-based Student Health Survey. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed among a final sample of 89,777 adolescents (49.2% females) aged 12-15 years with a mean (SD) age of 13.7 (0.9) years. The overall prevalence of past (i.e., in lifetime but not in past 30 days) and current (in past 30 days) cannabis use were 1.0% and 2.9% respectively, while the prevalence of adequate PA in the past week (7 days/week of 60&#x2009;min of PA) was 16.6%. The prevalence of adequate levels of PA in past and current cannabis use was 7.3% and 6.9%, respectively. Current and past cannabis use (vs. never) were associated with a significant 0.62 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.41-0.94) and 0.43 (95%CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.30-0.63) times lower odds for achieving adequate levels of PA, respectively. The results underscore the high prevalence of low PA among adolescents in LMICs, and emphasize the need to understand behavioral factors that may affect PA levels, such as cannabis use, when designing interventions to improve health.",2019,12,1,"Drug and alcohol dependence","10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107584",NA,"Drug Alcohol Depend","eng","D000293; D002188; D002648; D003430; D003906; D015444; D005260; D015438; D006306; D006801; D008297; D000074609; D011203","Adolescent; Cannabis; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Developing Countries; Exercise; Female; Health Behavior; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Marijuana Use; Poverty","ICA-CL-2017-03-001","NA",NA,"Research and Development Unit, Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de D&#xe9;u, Universitat de Barcelona, Fundaci&#xf3; Sant Joan de D&#xe9;u, CIBERSAM, Dr. Antoni Pujadas, Barcelona, 08830, Spain; ICREA, Pg.

A household survey was administered to the households of primary health clinic-attenders who were screened for depression symptoms using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire in the chronic care units of four primary health clinics in the North West province of South Africa. Univariate and multivariable regression models were used to assess whether a range of household economic measures were significant predictors of depression symptom severity; and whether depression symptom severity significantly predicted changes to household economic welfare, across a number of different economic measures using both multiple linear regression and logistic regression analyses. On univariate analysis, certain characteristics were associated with significantly worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores, namely: households in which the household head was younger, female, and unmarried; households in which the indexed patient was younger, and did not receive an education beyond primary school; increasing household size, receipt of a social grant, households living in housing constructed of metal sheet walls and households making use of a public tap as their primary water source. In addition, univariate analysis demonstrated that higher log-transformed food expenditure, lower log-transformed capacity to pay, the presence of household debt and both reducing the size or frequency of meals and drawing up retail shop accounts in response to financial distress over the past three years were associated with significantly worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that larger household sizes (p&lt;0.05), receipt of social grants (p&lt;0.05), higher food expenditure (p&lt;0.01), and drawing up retail shop accounts in response to financial distress (p&lt;0.05) were independently predictive of worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores. Inversely, increasing age of the household head (p&lt;0.05), having piped water directly into the household (as opposed to making use of a public water sources) (p&lt;0.01), and increasing capacity to pay (p&lt;0.01) were independently predictive of better (lower) PHQ-9 scores. Similarly, multivariable analysis demonstrated that worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores were independently predictive of lower household capacity to pay (p&lt;0.10) and higher food expenditure (p&lt;0.01). This study is the first of its kind in South Africa, identifying household economic factors associated with increased depression symptom severity on a continuum; and demonstrating that financial risk protection efforts are needed across this continuum. The study demonstrates that the relationship between poverty and mental health extends beyond the individual to affect household economic functioning.

This study tested the utility of two theories proposed to link SES to children's EF: the family stress model and the family investment model. Data came from the Midwestern Infant Development Study (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;151). To measure SES, parental education and income were assessed during pregnancy, and income was also assessed when children were 6 and 36&#xa0;months old. Children's EF, operationalized as working memory/inhibitory control (WMIC) and self-control, was assessed at 36&#xa0;months of age, along with potential mediators including maternal psychological distress, harsh parenting, and cognitive stimulation. Using structural equation modeling, we tested simultaneous pathways from SES to EF: (a) via maternal psychological distress to harsh parenting (family stress model) and (b) via cognitive stimulation (family investment model). Of the SES measures, lower education predicted poorer WMIC directly and indirectly via greater maternal psychological distress. Lower education also predicted poorer self-control via greater maternal psychological distress. This effect was partially suppressed by an indirect path from lower education to better self-control via greater psychological distress and increased harsh parenting. Cognitive stimulation did not act as a mediator. Income was not directly or indirectly associated with EF. These findings provide partial support for the family stress model and suggest that family functioning is an important proximal mechanism for children's EF development. This study also highlights the importance of considering SES as a multidimensional construct.",2020,5,1,"Developmental science","10.1111/desc.12917",NA,"Dev Sci","eng","D002657; D002675; D056344; D005260; D006801; D007223; D008297; D008570; D016487; D010290; D000068356; D012923","Child Development; Child, Preschool; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Parenting; Parents; Self-Control; Social Class","R21 DA024769; R01DA023653; R01 DA014661; R21DA024769; R01 DA023653","NA",NA,"Department of Psychology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada."

Increasing age (HR: 1.08 (CI: 1.08-1.09)), being in the lowest wealth quintile (HR: 1.79 (CI: 1.54-2.08)), lack of educational qualifications (HR: 1.19 (CI: 1.09-1.30)), obesity (HR: 1.33 (CI: 1.18-1.50) and a high waist-hip ratio (HR: 1.25 (CI: 1.13-1.38)), being a current or previous smoker (HR: 1.29 (CI: 1.18-1.41)), pain (HR: 1.39 (CI: 1.34-1.45)), sedentary behaviour (HR: 2.17 (CI: 1.76-2.78) and lower body strength (HR: 1.07 (CI: 1.06-1.08)), were all significant risk factors for frailty progression and incidence after simultaneous adjustment for all examined factors. The findings of this study suggest that there may be scope to reduce both frailty incidence and progression by trialling interventions aimed at reducing obesity and sedentary behaviour, increasing intensity of physical activity, and improving success of smoking cessation tools. Furthermore, improving educational outcomes and reducing poverty may also reduce inequalities in frailty.",2019,1,1,"PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0223799","PMC6821067","PLoS One","eng","D000368; D000369; D000375; D018450; D005260; D005500; D000073496; D006801; D016014; D008137; D008297; D006113","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Disease Progression; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Frailty; Humans; Linear Models; Longitudinal Studies; Male; United Kingdom","R01 AG017644","10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62167-9; 10.1016/j.jamda.2015.12.016; 10.1093/gerona/gls119; 10.1186/1471-2318-13-64; 10.1093/gerona/56.3.M146; 10.1093/aje/kwx061; 10.1186/1471-2318-8-24; 10.1186/s12916-018-1223-3; 10.1186/s12916-015-0420-6; 10.1093/gerona/62.7.738; 10.1007/s10522-017-9677-9; 10.1016/j.arr.2013.06.004; 10.1093/gerona/glu117; 10.1007/s12603-016-0685-2; 10.1016/j.jamda.2016.09.015; 10.1007/s12603-016-0828-5; 10.1007/s40520-017-0741-8; 10.1093/ageing/afp202; 10.3389/fnagi.2018.00295; 10.1093/ije/dys168; 10.1093/gerona/62.7.722; 10.1100/tsw.2001.58; 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2005.00506.x; 10.1016/j.mad.2006.12.004; 10.1093/gerona/60.8.1046; 10.1159/000088705; 10.1093/bioinformatics/btr597; 10.1037/a0022826; 10.1177/0164027504268574; 10.1038/ejcn.2009.139; 10.1007/s10433-017-0414-7; 10.1016/j.jalz.2019.04.013; 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2011.03300.x; 10.1177/0898264311428490; 10.1007/s12603-015-0634-5; 10.1002/oby.21013; 10.1007/s40520-018-0933-x; 10.1093/ije/dyz120; 10.1016/j.jamda.2013.11.008; 10.1053/j.gastro.2007.03.059; 10.1210/jc.2004-0535; 10.1097/MCO.0b013e32831c8c71; 10.1371/journal.pone.0148908; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60735-1; 10.1371/journal.pone.0170878; 10.1186/s40064-015-1357-0; 10.1186/s12877-015-0155-4; 10.3143/geriatrics.49.442; 10.1136/pgmj.2006.048587; 10.1590/1516-3180.2014.1325669; 10.1016/j.cger.2011.03.003; 10.1007/s10433-010-0141-9; 10.1093/gerona/gls166; 10.1186/s12877-015-0134-9; 10.1093/ageing/afx136; 10.1136/heartjnl-2013-304082; 10.1164/rccm.201204-0596PP; 10.1097/MD.0000000000014872; 10.1136/bmj.j5855; 10.1093/gerona/glw226; 10.1016/s0304-3959(98)00229-2; 10.1136/jnnp.2008.158444; 10.1016/j.jad.2010.10.022; 10.1016/j.pain.2013.09.005; 10.1093/ageing/afx188; 10.1136/eb-2013-101379; 10.1136/jech.2008.078428; 10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.11.009; 10.1111/j.1475-5890.2016.12109; 10.1053/euhj.1999.1990; 10.1021/jo901279g; 10.1212/01.WNL.0000069923.64550.9F; 10.1016/j.annepidem.2014.05.002; 10.1212/wnl.53.9.1942; 10.1016/S0022-3999(02)00303-3; 10.14283/jfa.2012.4; 10.1186/s12877-019-1229-5; 10.7717/peerj.4326; 10.1093/geronb/gbz004","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Department of Physiology, Neuroscience and Behavioural Sciences, St. George's University, St. George's, Grenada."

Distribution of stroke risk factors is changing worldwide; evidence on these trends is crucial to the allocation of resources for prevention strategies to tackle major modifiable risk factors with the highest impact on stroke burden. We extracted data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017. We analysed trends in global and SES-specific age-standardised stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost from 1990 to 2017. We also estimated the age-standardised attributable risk of stroke mortality associated with common risk factors in low-, low-middle-, upper-middle-, and high-income countries. Further, we explored the effect of age and sex on associations of risk factors with stroke mortality from 1990 to 2017. Despite a growth in crude number of stroke events from 1990 to 2017, there has been an 11.3% decrease in age-standardised stroke incidence rate worldwide (150.5, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 140.3-161.8 per 100,000 in 2017). This has been accompanied by an overall 3.1% increase in age-standardised stroke prevalence rate (1300.6, UI 1229.0-1374.7 per 100,000 in 2017) and a 33.4% decrease in age-standardised stroke mortality rate (80.5, UI 78.9-82.6 per 100,000 in 2017) over the same time period. The rising trends in age-standardised stroke prevalence have been observed only in middle-income countries, despite declining trends in age-standardised stroke incidence and mortality in all income categories since 2005. Further, there has been almost a 34% reduction in stroke death rate (67.8, UI 64.1-71.1 per 100,000 in 2017) attributable to modifiable risk factors, more prominently in wealthier countries. Almost half of stroke-related deaths are attributable to poor management of modifiable risk factors, and thus potentially preventable. We should appreciate societal barriers in lower-SES groups to design tailored preventive strategies. Despite improvements in general health knowledge, access to healthcare, and preventative strategies, SES is still strongly associated with modifiable risk factors and stroke burden; thus, screening of people from low SES at higher stroke risk is crucial.",2019,10,24,"BMC medicine","10.1186/s12916-019-1397-3","PMC6813111","BMC Med","eng","D000328; D000368; D002675; D006233; D005260; D000071219; D014943; D006801; D015994; D008297; D015995; D019057; D012307; D012923; D020521; D015996","Adult; Aged; Child, Preschool; Disabled Persons; Female; Global Burden of Disease; Global Health; Humans; Incidence; Male; Prevalence; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Risk Factors; Social Class; Stroke; Survival Rate",NA,"10.1016/S1474-4422(17)30299-5; 10.1161/01.STR.0000097610.12803.D7; 10.1186/1475-9276-12-42; 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61953-4; 10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31891-9; 10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32279-7; 10.1016/S1474-4422(18)30499-X; 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2; 10.1093/ije/dyn214; 10.1161/01.STR.0000221702.75002.66; 10.1093/aje/155.6.520; 10.1001/jamaneurol.2016.3482; 10.1007/s11886-009-0080-2; 10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.540781; 10.1016/S1474-4422(08)70193-5; 10.1159/000320855; 10.1136/jech-2017-209728; 10.5694/j.1326-5377.2011.tb03180.x; 10.1111/j.1747-4949.2012.00927.x; 10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.011523; 10.1590/0004-282X20130024; 10.1371/journal.pone.0089271; 10.1016/j.jegh.2012.06.001; 10.1161/STROKEAHA.111.623512; 10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2014.04.003; 10.1159/000374118; 10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.04.009; 10.1136/jnnp.2010.233429; 10.1111/ijs.12343; 10.1186/1471-2458-8-170; 10.1186/1471-2458-6-227; 10.1016/S1474-4422(09)70023-7","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Department of Neurology, Ghaem Hospital, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."

The current study builds on findings showing the effectiveness of depression quality improvement (QI) and delivery of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) skills provided by community health workers in reducing depression. Depression QI approaches across healthcare and social/community services in safety-net settings have shown improvements in mental wellness, mental health quality of life and depression over 12 months. Further, a randomised study showed improved depression among low-income racial/ethnic minorities enrolled in a CBT-informed resiliency class (Building Resilience and Increasing Community Hope (B-RICH)). The current protocol describes a comparativeness effectiveness study to evaluate whether predominantly low-income, SGM racial/ethnic minority adults randomised to a CBT-informed resiliency class have improvements in depressive symptoms over and above community-engaged QI resources and training only. The study approached three clusters of four to five programs serving predominantly SGM and racial/ethnic minority communities in the USA: two clusters in Los Angeles, California, and one in New Orleans, Louisiana. Clusters are comprised of one primary care, one mental health and two to three community agencies (eg, faith-based, social services/support, advocacy). All programs received depression QI training. The current study employed a community-partnered participatory research model to adapt the CBT-informed resiliency class, B-RICH+, to SGM communities. Study participants were screened and recruited in person from participating programs, and will complete baseline, 6- and 12-month survey follow-ups. Participants were depressed adults (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire &#x2265;10; &#x2265;18 years of age) who provided contact information. Enrolled participants were individually randomised to B-RICH+ or depression QI alone. Primary outcomes are depressive symptoms; secondary outcomes are mental health quality of life, mental wellness and physical health quality of life. Data collection for this study is ongoing. The current study was approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board.

Understanding what factors are related to the increased or decreased use of spanking/slapping is necessary to inform prevention. This study used a population-based sample to determine the prevalence of slapping/spanking reported by youth; the relationship between sociodemographic factors and slapping/spanking; and the extent to which parental exposures to victimization and maltreatment in childhood and current parental mental health, substance use and family circumstances, are associated with youth reports of slapping/spanking. Data were from the 2014 Ontario Child Health Study, a provincially representative sample of households with children and youth aged 4-17&#x2009;years. Self-reported lifetime slapping/spanking prevalence was determined using a sub-sample of youth aged 14-17&#x2009;years (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1883). Parents/primary caregivers (i.e., person most knowledgeable (PMK) of the youth) self-reported their own childhood experiences including bullying victimization, slapping/spanking and child maltreatment, and current mental health, substance use and family circumstances including mental health functioning and emotional well-being, alcohol use, smoking, marital conflict and family functioning. Analyses were conducted in 2018. Living in urban compared to rural residence and family poverty were associated with decreased odds of slapping/spanking. PMK childhood experiences of physical and verbal bullying victimization, spanking, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and exposure to physical intimate partner violence were associated with increased odds of youth reported slapping/spanking (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] ranged from 1.33-1.77).

"31628416","Socioeconomic status and inflammation: a meta-analysis.","Keely A Muscatell, Samantha N Brosso, Kathryn L Humphreys","Socioeconomic status (SES), often conceptualized as income, education, or occupation, is associated with risk for disease morbidity and psychopathology. Recent research has focused on the potential biological mechanisms linking lower SES and poor outcomes; much of this work has examined the relationship between SES and markers of systemic inflammation. The strength of the estimated association between SES and inflammatory markers varies widely across individual studies. Thus, we used meta-analytic techniques to quantify the magnitude of this relationship. To accomplish this, PubMed and PsycINFO were searched for papers that reported on SES and two commonly measured systemic inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Peer-reviewed, empirical papers conducted in non-patient populations were included. Data from 43 papers (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;111,156) reporting a total of 63 relevant effect sizes were included in analyses. SES, broadly defined, was significantly associated with both levels of CRP (Z&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.12; 95% CI, 0.09-0.16) and IL-6 (Z&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.15; 95% CI, 0.12-0.18); individuals with lower SES showed higher levels of systemic inflammation. Subanalyses demonstrated that studies operationalizing SES as either levels of income or educational attainment also found significant associations with both CRP and IL-6. Moderator analyses revealed that effect sizes varied based on sample characteristics and analysis approaches. Lower SES is associated with significantly elevated levels of inflammatory markers of disease risk. Thus, pro-inflammatory pathways are likely an important mechanism translating socioeconomic inequalities into mental and physical health disparities.",2020,9,1,"Molecular psychiatry","10.1038/s41380-018-0259-2","PMC6814496","Mol Psychiatry","eng","D002097; D004522; D006801; D007182; D007249; D015850; D012923; D012959","C-Reactive Protein; Educational Status; Humans; Income; Inflammation; Interleukin-6; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors","F32 MH107129","10.1037/0003-066X.49.1.15; 10.1001/jama.295.11.1304; 10.1093/aje/kwf182; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.0346; 10.1038/nrcardio.2009.163; 10.1001/jama.295.7.784; 10.1017/S0033291708003723; 10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.11.035; 10.1161/HS1101.098151; 10.1016/j.jacc.2010.10.043; 10.1001/jama.298.14.1685; 10.1093/jnci/dju294; 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01158.x; 10.1136/hrt.78.3.273; 10.1016/S0889-1591(02)00030-2; 10.1097/01.EDE.0000023965.92535.C0; 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)71146-6; 10.1038/mp.2015.67; 10.1016/j.bbi.2009.04.005; 10.1136/BMJ.315.7109.629; 10.1007/s12160-012-9443-9; 10.1002/wcs.1176; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181907c1b; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.05.014; 10.1136/jech-2016-208646; 10.1093/epirev/mxm007; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06202.x; 10.1080/15700763.2011.577928; 10.1146/annurev.soc.28.110601.141114; 10.1080/08870440310001638098; 10.1016/j.yfrne.2018.03.001; 10.1037/a0027300; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e31829683bd; 10.1371/journal.pone.0045419; 10.1016/j.bbi.2011.05.016; 10.1016/j.bbi.2008.12.009; 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000160; 10.1186/1471-2458-12-211; 10.1037/a0023871; 10.1007/s11524-016-0034-0; 10.1373/clinchem.2008.122093; 10.1093/aje/kwm247; 10.1016/j.amepre.2010.05.014; 10.1037/hea0000392; 10.5888/pcd11.140090; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e31824f5f6d; 10.1093/geronb/gbs048; 10.1037/hea0000130; 10.1007/s12160-008-9056-5; 10.1016/j.schres.2015.08.019; 10.1093/gerona/61.3.284; 10.1093/aje/kwj076; 10.1016/j.amjcard.2005.10.043; 10.1097/01.psy.0000238451.22174.92; 10.1097/01.psy.0000221371.43607.64; 10.1073/pnas.0902971106; 10.1177/0956797610370161; 10.1016/j.ypmed.2007.04.005; 10.1016/j.bbi.2012.10.019; 10.1016/S0027-9684(15)31300-6; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e31817b8ee4; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e31828b871a; 10.1016/j.ssresearch.2016.04.001; 10.1136/archdischild-2016-310837; 10.1016/j.bbi.2010.06.007; 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000078; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.10.019; 10.1037/hea0000240; 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000276; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.03.016; 10.1155/2008/509138","<b>Conflict of interest</b> Dr. Humphreys received financial support from NIH, the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, the Klingenstein Third Generation Foundation, and the Jacobs Foundation.

However, most such disorders remain undiagnosed until adolescence or adulthood. Little is known about the factors that influence mental health in children and adolescents, especially in low and middle-income countries (LMIC), where environmental threats, such as poverty and war, may affect optimal neurodevelopment. Cohort studies provide important information on risks and resilience across the life course by enabling tracking of the effects of early life environment on health during childhood and beyond. Large birth cohort studies, including twin cohorts that can be aetiologically informative, have been conducted within high-income countries but are not generalisable to LMIC. There are limited longitudinal birth cohort studies in LMIC. We sought to enhance the volume of impactful research in Sri Lanka by establishing a Centre of Excellence for cohort studies. The aim is to establish a register of infant, child and adolescent twins, including mothers pregnant with twins, starting in the districts of Colombo (Western Province) and Vavuniya (Northern Province). We will gain consent from twins or parents for future research projects. This register will provide the platform to investigate the aetiology of mental illness and the impact of challenges to early brain development on future mental health. Using this register, we will be able to conduct research that will (1) expand existing research capacity on child and adolescent mental health and twin methods; (2) further consolidate existing partnerships and (3) establish new collaborations. The initiative is underpinned by three pillars: high-quality research, ethics, and patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE).

"31573920","Mobile Phone Access and Preference for Technology-Assisted Aftercare Among Low-Income Caregivers of Teens Enrolled in Outpatient Substance Use Treatment: Questionnaire Study.","Stacy R Ryan-Pettes, Lindsay L Lange, Katherine I Magnuson","Improvements in parenting practices can positively mediate the outcomes of treatment for adolescent substance use disorder. Given the high rates of release among adolescents (ie, 60% within three months and 85% within one year), there is a critical need for interventions focused on helping parents achieve and maintain effective parenting practices posttreatment. Yet, research suggests that engaging parents in aftercare services is difficult, partly due to systemic-structural and personal barriers. One way to increase parent use of aftercare services may be to offer mobile health interventions, given the potential for wide availability and on-demand access. However, it remains unclear whether mobile phone-based aftercare support for caregivers of substance-using teens is feasible or desired. Therefore, formative work in this area is needed. This study aims to determine the feasibility and acceptability of mobile phone-based aftercare support in a population of caregivers with teens in treatment for substance use. Upon enrollment in a treatment program, 103 caregivers completed a mobile phone use survey, providing information about mobile phone ownership, access, and use. Caregivers also provided a response to items assessing desire for aftercare services, in general; desire for mobile phone-based aftercare services specifically; and desire for parenting specific content as part of aftercare services. Research assistants also monitored clinic calls made to caregivers' mobile phones to provide an objective measure of the reliability of phone service. Most participants were mothers (76.7%) and self-identified as Hispanic (73.8%). The average age was 42.60 (SD 9.28) years. A total of 94% of caregivers owned a mobile phone. Most had pay-as-you-go phone service (67%), and objective data suggest this did not impede accessibility. Older caregivers more frequently had a yearly mobile contract. Further, older caregivers and caregivers of adolescent girls had fewer disconnections. Bilingual caregivers used text messaging less often; however, caregivers of adolescent girls used text messaging more often. Although 72% of caregivers reported that aftercare was needed, 91% of caregivers endorsed a desire for mobile phone-based aftercare support in parenting areas that are targets of evidence-based treatments.

"31558103","The E Is in the G: Gene-Environment-Trait Correlations and Findings From Genome-Wide Association Studies.","Reut Avinun","Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have shown that pleiotropy is widespread (i.e., the same genetic variants affect multiple traits) and that complex traits are polygenic (i.e., affected by many genetic variants with very small effect sizes). However, despite the growing number of GWASs, the possible contribution of gene-environment correlations (rGEs) to pleiotropy and polygenicity has been mostly ignored. rGEs can lead to environmentally mediated pleiotropy or <i>gene-environment-trait correlations</i> (rGETs), given that an environment that is affected by one genetically influenced phenotype, can in turn affect a different phenotype. By adding correlations with environmentally mediated genetic variants, rGETs can contribute to polygenicity. Socioeconomic status (SES) and the experience of stressful life events may, for example, be involved in rGETs. Both are genetically influenced and have been associated with a myriad of physical and mental disorders. As a result, GWASs of these disorders may find the genetic correlates of SES and stressful life events. Consequently, some of the genetic correlates of physical and mental disorders may be modified by public policy that affects environments such as SES and stressful life events. Thus, identifying rGETs can shed light on findings from GWASs and have important implications for public health.",2020,1,1,"Perspectives on psychological science : a journal of the Association for Psychological Science","10.1177/1745691619867107","PMC6980468","Perspect Psychol Sci","eng","D059647; D058685; D055106; D006801; D001523; D020412","Gene-Environment Interaction; Genetic Pleiotropy; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Mental Disorders; Multifactorial Inheritance","R01 AG049789","10.1101/536938; 10.1038/s41467-018-05510-z; 10.1037/0012-1649.42.5.771; 10.1037/a0014179",NA,"Department of Psychology &amp; Neuroscience, Duke University."

To identify the challenges, opportunities and strategies for more equitable and sustainable mental health financing in six sub-Saharan African and South Asian countries, namely Ethiopia, India, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda. In the context of a mental health systems research project (Emerald), a multi-methods approach was implemented consisting of three steps: a quantitative and narrative assessment of each country's disease burden profile, health system and macro-fiscal situation; in-depth interviews with expert stakeholders; and a policy analysis of sustainable financing options. Key challenges identified for sustainable mental health financing include the low level of funding accorded to mental health services, widespread inequalities in access and poverty, although opportunities exist in the form of new political interest in mental health and ongoing reforms to national insurance schemes. Inclusion of mental health within planned or nascent national health insurance schemes was identified as a key strategy for moving towards more equitable and sustainable mental health financing in all six countries.

"31530319","The relationship between depressive symptoms and negative symptoms in people with non-affective psychosis: a meta-analysis.","Clementine Jane Edwards, Philippa Garety, Amy Hardy","The negative symptoms of psychosis and depressive symptomatology share several features, e.g. low motivation, apathy and reduced activity. Understanding the associations between these two sets of symptoms will support improved assessment and the development of interventions targeting these difficulties in people with psychosis. This is the first large systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the relationship between these two categories of symptoms, as measured in studies to date. PsycInfo, Embase and Medline were systematically searched to identify eligible studies. Inclusion criteria ensured the studies measured both depression and negative symptoms using validated measures in a sample of over 8000 participants with non-affective psychosis diagnoses. The search led to 2020 records being screened and 56 included in the meta-analysis and review. Both meta-analyses and meta-regressions were conducted to explore the main effect and potential moderating variables. A clear pattern emerges showing that higher ratings of negative symptoms are associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms, with a small effect [standardised effect size = 0.19, p &lt; 0.05). This did not vary greatly with the measures used (SES = 0.19-0.26) and was not moderated by demographic variables or quality ratings. Interestingly, higher depressive symptoms predict a significant relationship with co-occurring negative symptoms. However, higher negative symptoms predict that it is less likely there will be a relationship with co-occurring depressive symptoms. Heterogeneity was high across these analyses. The findings support the adoption of a symptom-specific approach to understanding the interplay between negative and depressive symptoms in psychosis, to improve assessment and intervention.",2019,11,1,"Psychological medicine","10.1017/S0033291719002381",NA,"Psychol Med","eng","D003863; D003866; D006801; D011618; D063189","Depression; Depressive Disorder; Humans; Psychotic Disorders; Symptom Assessment",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Psychology, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, De Crespigny Park, SE5 8AF, UK."

Despite some heterogeneity between MNS disorder groups and countries, households with a member with an MNS disorder had generally lower levels of adult education; lower housing standards, total household income, effective income and non-health consumption; less asset-based wealth; higher healthcare expenditure; and greater use of deleterious financial coping strategies. Households living with a member who has an MNS disorder constitute an economically vulnerable group who are susceptible to chronic poverty and intergenerational poverty transmission.

Our objective was to compare epilepsy prevalence and emergency medical service (EMS) assignments for seizures in areas of different socioeconomic standings in the urban area of Gothenburg. Register-based study in Gothenburg (population 690&#xa0;000), the second largest city in Sweden. Epilepsy cases were identified in the comprehensive national patient register in 2014-2015. EMS assignments were identified in the EMS dispatch system in 2013-2018. Socioeconomic variables were mean income and proportion of welfare recipients. Significant correlations were seen between epilepsy prevalence and the proportion of welfare recipients (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;.49, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.0014) and annual income per capita (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;-.42, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.0071).

Medical records were reviewed of all new patients over the age of 40 who presented to the Stein Eye Institute with binocular diplopia between January 2015 and December 2018. Clinical causes of diplopia were tabulated in patients grouped by age and sex. In patients with SES, we tabulated binocular alignment, types of treatment, and surgical outcomes. There were 945 patients of mean age 66.5 years, of whom 514 (54.4%) were female. The most common cause of diplopia was SES (31.4%).

Mental health service user involvement could be an important strategy for advocacy and improving service delivery, particularly as Uganda redoubles its efforts to integrate mental health into primary health care (PHC). However, little is known on the most effective way to involve service users in mental health system strengthening. This was a qualitative key informant interview study. At national level, 4 interviews were conducted with national level health workers and 3 service user organization representatives. At the district level, 2 interviews were conducted with district level health workers and 5 service user organization representatives. Data were analyzed using content thematic analysis. Overall, there was low mental service user participation in health system strengthening at both national and district levels. Health system strengthening activities included policy development, implementation of programs and research. Informants mentioned several barriers to service user involvement in mental health system strengthening. These were grouped into three categories: institutional, community and individual level factors. Institutional level barriers included: limited funding to form, train and develop mental health service user groups, institutional stigma and patronage by founder members of user organizations. Community level barriers included: abject poverty and community stigma. Individual level barriers included: low levels of awareness and presence of self-stigma. Informants also recommended some strategies to enhance service user involvement. The Uganda Ministry of Health should develop a strategy to improve service user participation in mental health system strengthening. This requires an appreciation of the importance of service users in improving service delivery. To address the barriers to service user involvement identified in this study requires concerted efforts by the Uganda Ministry of Health and the district health services, specifically with regard to attitudes of health workers, dealing with stigma at all levels, raising awareness about the rights of service users to participate in health systems strengthening activities, building capacity and financial empowerment of service user organizations.",2019,1,1,"International journal of mental health systems","10.1186/s13033-019-0316-5","PMC6728966","Int J Ment Health Syst","eng",NA,NA,"205069/Z/16/Z","NA","Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests","Butabika National Referral and Teaching Mental Hospital, Kampala, Uganda."

Inequality in educational outcomes between children from different SES backgrounds exists in all Western countries. It has been proposed that a cause of this inequality lies in the interplay between genetic effects and SES on EA, which might depend on society and the equality of the education system. This study adopted two approaches, a classical twin design and polygenic score (PGS) approach, to address the effect of parental SES on EA in a large sample of 12-year-old Dutch twin pairs (2479 MZ and 4450 DZ twin pairs with PGSs for educational attainment available in 2335 children) from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR). The findings of this study indicated that average EA increased with increasing parental SES. The difference in EA between boys and girls became smaller in the higher SES groups. The classical twin design analyses based on genetic covariance structure modeling pointed to lower genetic, environmental, and thus phenotypic variation in EA at higher SES. Independent from a child's PGS, parental SES predicted EA. However, the strength of the association between PGS and EA did not depend on parental SES. In a within-family design, the twin with a higher PGS scored higher on EA than the co-twin, demonstrating that the effect of the PGS on EA was at least partly independent from parental SES. To conclude, EA depended on SES both directly and indirectly, and SES moderated the additive genetic and environmental components of EA. Adding information from PGS, in addition to parental SES, improved the prediction of children's EA.",2019,1,1,"NPJ science of learning","10.1038/s41539-019-0052-2","PMC6722095","NPJ Sci Learn","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.intell.2006.09.004; 10.1016/j.lindif.2013.01.015; 10.1111/j.1542-4774.2012.01096.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00600.x; 10.1080/13803611.2015.1010545; 10.1073/pnas.1800028115; 10.1017/S0033291706009524; 10.1038/mp.2009.55; 10.3389/fgene.2017.00160; 10.1111/1467-8624.00084; 10.1017/thg.2017.32; 10.1038/s41539-018-0019-8; 10.1177/0956797615612727; 10.1073/pnas.1708491114; 10.1375/136905202762342026; 10.1038/nature08185; 10.1038/mp.2010.65; 10.1038/nature17671; 10.1038/mp.2016.107; 10.1111/j.1475-682X.1970.tb01004.x; 10.1111/j.1533-8525.2005.00014.x; 10.1375/twin.12.3.246; 10.1038/mp.2017.210; 10.1073/pnas.1801238115; 10.1017/thg.2018.11; 10.1126/science.aan6877; 10.1007/s10519-007-9156-1; 10.1017/thg.2012.118; 10.1007/s10519-015-9771-1; 10.2307/590252; 10.1007/s10519-015-9725-7; 10.1038/ejhg.2013.48; 10.1002/gepi.21690; 10.1007/s11336-014-9435-8; 10.1007/BF01065901; 10.1136/jmedgenet-2013-102197; 10.1038/nrg3457; 10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.09.001","Competing interestsThe authors declare no competing interests.","1Department of Biological Psychology, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."

This study examines the long-term effect of childhood conditions on cognition among a nationally representative sample of older adults in a low- and middle-income country. Data were obtained from the 2014 to 2015 Indonesia Family Life Survey Wave 5 (6676 respondents, aged 50 years and older). Cognitive function was assessed based on total score on a series of tests adapted from the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status. Retrospective information was collected on childhood poverty, with questions including whether respondents ever experienced hunger before age 15, whether basic facilities were available, and the number of books in the childhood home. We used linear regression to examine the association between childhood conditions and cognitive function in later life. The findings show that the numbers of facilities and books available in childhood homes are substantially associated with cognition in later life after taking adulthood characteristics into account. Childhood hunger has no significant association with cognitive ability in later life. Belonging to an older birth cohort and living in a rural area were shown to have negative associations with cognitive ability in Indonesia. Our findings suggest that childhood poverty, birth cohort, and living in a rural area may contribute to cognitive aging in Indonesia.

As part of the Ageing, Chronic Disease and Injury study, we aimed to map the incidence rates of primary cancer diagnoses across western Victoria and investigate the association of age, accessibility/remoteness index of Australia (ARIA) and area-level socioeconomic status (SES) with cancer incidence. Data on cancer incidence in the study region were extracted from the Victorian Cancer Registry (VCR) for men and women aged 40+ years during 2010-2013, inclusive. The age-adjusted incidence rates (per 10,000 population/year), as well as specific incidence for breast, prostate, lung, bowel and melanoma cancers, were calculated for the entire region and for the 21 Local Government Areas (LGA) that make up the whole region. The association of aggregated age, ARIA and SES with cancer incidence rates across LGAs was determined using Poisson regression. Overall, 15,120 cancer cases were identified; 8218 (54%) men and 6902 women. For men, the age-standardised rate of cancer incidence for the whole region was 182.1 per 10,000 population/year (95% CI 177.7-186.5) and for women, 162.2 (95% CI: 157.9-166.5). The incidence of cancer (overall) increased with increasing age for men and women. Geographical variations in cancer incidence were also observed across the LGAs, with differences identified between men and women.

To inform early intervention planning, this research therefore aimed to describe the health and social adversities experienced by a cohort of girls and young women in early pregnancy in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Participants were recruited for the BC Healthy Connections Project (BCHCP), a randomized controlled trial examining the effectiveness of Nurse-Family Partnership, a home visitation program, in improving child and maternal outcomes. Baseline data were collected from 739 participants on trial entry. Participants were selected on the basis of preparing to parent for the first time and experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage. Analyses involved descriptive statistics and age-group comparisons. Most participants reported having low income (84%), having limited education (52%) and being single (91%) at trial entry. Beyond these eligibility criteria, other health and social adversities included: housing instability (52%); severe anxiety or depression (47%); other diagnosed mental disorders (22%); prenatal nicotine and cannabis use (27 and 21%); physical health problems (20%); child maltreatment when younger (56%); and intimate partner violence recently (50%). As well, few (29%) had received income assistance entitlements. More than two thirds (70%) were experiencing four or more forms of adversity. Age-group differences were observed for cognitive functioning, being single, low income, limited education, psychological distress and service use (p-value &#x2264;0.05). This cohort was selected on the basis of socioeconomic disadvantage. Yet all participants were experiencing substantial added adversities - at higher rates than other Canadians. Furthermore, despite Canada's public programs, these pregnant girls and young women were not being adequately reached by social services. Our study adds new data to inform early intervention planning, suggesting that unacceptably high levels of socioeconomic disadvantage exist for some young British Columbians.

The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of delivering a psychosocial intervention targeting depression, and to develop the procedures to conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial among older adults registered with primary care clinics in poor neighbourhoods of S&#xe3;o Paulo, Brazil. We conducted a pilot study of a two-arm cluster, non-randomized controlled trial. Two primary care clinics adhering to the Family Health Strategy were allocated to either the intervention or the control arm. In the control arm, patients received enhanced usual care consisting of staff training for improved recognition and management of depression. In the intervention arm, alongside the enhanced usual care, patients received a 17-week psychosocial intervention delivered by health workers assisted with an application installed in a tablet. We randomly selected 579 of 2020 older adults registered in the intervention clinic to participate in the study. Among these individuals, 353 were assessed for depression and 40 (11.0%) scored at least 10 on the PHQ-9 and were therefore invited to participate. The consent rate was 33/40 (82%) with a resulting yield of 33/579 (5.7%). In the control arm, we randomly selected 320 older adults among 1482 registered in the clinic, 223 were assessed for depression and 28 (12.6%) scored 10 or above on the PHQ-9. The consent rate was 25/28 (89%), with a resulting yield of 25/320 (7.8%). Of the 33 who consented in the intervention arm, 19 (59.4%) completed all sessions.

Physical activity is one potential psychosocial strategy with the potential to reduce loneliness in this population. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore associations between physical activity (PA) and loneliness in middle-aged and older people from six LMICs. Data from the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) were analyzed. Self-reported data on loneliness and PA (as assessed by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire) were collected. Participants were dichotomized into those who do and do not meet the international recommendation of 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous PA per week. Associations between loneliness and PA were examined using logistic regressions. Among 34 129 individuals aged 50 years or older, the prevalence of loneliness was higher among those not meeting the PA guidelines in all countries, although this difference was not significant in Mexico and South Africa. After full adjustment, not meeting PA guidelines was positively associated with loneliness in the meta-analysis based on country-wise estimates, with a moderate level of between-country heterogeneity being observed (OR = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.07-1.61; I<sup>2</sup> = 48.7%). At an individual country level, statistical significance was only reached in Ghana (OR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.44-2.49).

This study investigates whether health conditions and lifestyle-related risk factors explain the SES inequalities in dementia risk. 6,346 participants from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing were followed up from 2008/2009 until 2014/2015. We used Cox regression adjusted for age, gender, wealth/education, and clustering at the household level to examine the association between SES markers (wealth, education) and time to dementia in a structural equation model including potential mediation or effect modification by a weighted compound score of twelve modifiable risk and protective factors for dementia ('LIfestyle for BRAin health' (LIBRA) score). During a median follow-up of 6 years, 192 individuals (3.0%) developed dementia. LIBRA scores decreased with increasing wealth and higher educational level. A one-point increase in the LIBRA score was associated with a 13% increase in dementia risk (hazard ratio (HR)&#x200a;=&#x200a;1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.19). Higher wealth was associated with a decreased dementia risk (HR&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.58, 0.39-0.85).

Education was not directly associated with dementia (HR&#x200a;=&#x200a;1.05, 0.69-1.59), but was a distal risk factor for dementia by explaining differences in wealth and LIBRA scores (indirect effect high education: HR&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.92, 0.88-0.95).

"31424096","Adolescent childbirth, miscarriage, and abortion: associations with changes in alcohol, marijuana, and cigarette use.","Irene Tung, Jordan Beardslee, Dustin Pardini, Tammy Chung, Kate Keenan, Alison E Hipwell","Adolescent girls who become pregnant demonstrate greater risk for substance use than same-aged peers. However, it remains unclear how risk relates to normative changes in adolescence. Few studies have examined adolescent substance use changes before, during, and after pregnancy and considered how pregnancy outcomes (childbirth, miscarriage, abortion) differentially influence substance use changes. The present study examined associations between different adolescent pregnancy outcomes and within-person changes in substance use from prepregnancy to postpregnancy. Participants included 2,450 girls (52% Black) oversampled from low-income urban neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, PA. Participants self-reported pregnancy outcomes and substance use frequency (alcohol, cigarette, marijuana) annually from ages 11-20. Fixed effects regressions focused on first births, first miscarriages, and first abortions occurring from ages 12-19 to test the associations between pregnancy outcomes and within-individual changes in substance use from prepregnancy to postpregnancy. By design, models controlled for all potential time-stable confounds,&#xa0;and models included age and subsequent pregnancies as time-varying covariates. Consistent with prior studies, girls who became pregnant (20%) reported greater early risk for substance use problems than never-pregnant adolescents, including earlier age of onset and more regular marijuana and cigarette use. Childbirth predicted a 26%-51% within-individual reduction in alcohol, marijuana, and cigarette use that remained significantly lower than prepregnancy levels after childbirth. Alcohol and marijuana use decreased (32%-47%) after miscarriage. Abortion was not associated with long-term changes in substance use; however, marijuana and cigarette use gradually increased (44%-46%) in the years leading up to the year of and after abortion, respectively, before returning to prepregnancy levels. Findings highlight important differences in adolescent substance use patterns based on pregnancy outcome. For pregnant adolescents with heightened pre-existing risk for substance use, pregnancy may be a window of opportunity for substance use screening and behavioral intervention.",2020,1,1,"Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","10.1111/jcpp.13112","PMC6906255","J Child Psychol Psychiatry","eng","D000028; D000022; D000293; D000294; D000328; D002648; D000073865; D005260; D006801; D036801; D011203; D011247; D011253; D019966; D000066608; D014481; D055815","Abortion, Induced; Abortion, Spontaneous; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Adult; Child; Cigarette Smoking; Female; Humans; Parturition; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy in Adolescence; Substance-Related Disorders; Underage Drinking; United States; Young Adult","T32 AA007453; K01 MH071790; UH3 OD023244; R01 HD067185; R01 MH056630; R01 DA012237","10.1089/jwh.2007.0505; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2013.02.004; 10.2174/157340409788185785; 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.077230; 10.1111/dar.12152; 10.1111/j.1365-3016.2009.01036.x; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.09.014; 10.1177/0004867413484597; 10.1007/s00148-011-0381-9; 10.1016/S1054-139X(96)00052-3; 10.1002/cbm.489; 10.1080/08897077.2016.1268240; 10.1016/1054-139X(91)90007-K; 10.1080/15374416.2010.486320; 10.1007/s00737-009-0063-8; 10.1016/j.whi.2014.11.008; 10.1037/a0017497; 10.1177/002204268401400206; 10.15288/jsad.2018.79.293; 10.1111/acer.12544; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2015.01.039; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.09.007; 10.1037/a0018518; 10.1017/S0954579410000544; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.10.006; 10.1016/j.contraception.2012.03.012; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2016.10.006","Conflict of interest statement: No conflicts declared.","Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."
"31401241","Negative life experiences contribute to racial differences in the neural response to threat.","Nathaniel G Harnett, Muriah D Wheelock, Kimberly H Wood, Adam M Goodman, Sylvie Mrug, Marc N Elliott, Mark A Schuster, Susan Tortolero, David C Knight","Threat-related emotional function is supported by a neural circuit that includes the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and amygdala. The function of this neural circuit is altered by negative life experiences, which can potentially affect threat-related emotional processes. Notably, Black-American individuals disproportionately endure negative life experiences compared to White-American individuals. However, the relationships among negative life experiences, race, and the neural substrates that support threat-related emotional function remains unclear. Therefore, the current study investigated whether the brain function that supports threat-related emotional processes varies with racial differences in negative life experiences. In the present study, adolescent violence exposure, family income, and neighborhood disadvantage were measured prospectively (i.e., at 11-19 years of age) for Black-American and White-American volunteers. Participants then, as young adults (i.e., 18-23 years of age), completed a Pavlovian fear conditioning task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Cued and non-cued threats were presented during the conditioning task and behavioral (threat expectancy) and psychophysiological responses (skin conductance response; SCR) were recorded simultaneously with fMRI. Racial differences were observed in neural (fMRI activity), behavioral (threat expectancy), and psychophysiological (SCR) responses to threat. These threat-elicited responses also varied with negative life experiences (violence exposure, family income, and neighborhood disadvantage). Notably, racial differences in brain activity to threat were smaller after accounting for negative life experiences. The present findings suggest that racial differences in the neural and behavioral response to threat are due, in part, to exposure to negative life experiences and may provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying racial disparities in mental health.",2019,11,15,"NeuroImage","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116086","PMC6819267","Neuroimage","eng","D000293; D001741; D001921; D002648; D003214; D000069581; D005239; D005260; D054624; D006801; D008016; D008279; D008297; D011203; D044465; D055815","Adolescent; Black or African American; Brain; Child; Conditioning, Classical; Exposure to Violence; Fear; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Life Change Events; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Poverty; White People; Young Adult","U19 DP002664; U48 DP000046; U48 DP000057; U19 DP002663; U48 DP000056; R01 MH098348; T32 MH100019; U19 DP002665","10.1016/j.cpr.2009.12.008; 10.1016/j.pain.2014.05.015; 10.1196/annals.1417.016; 10.1038/nn.2242; 10.1111/j.1469-8986.2012.01384.x; 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000369; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.01.047; 10.1073/pnas.0800374105; 10.1037/0735-7044.120.5.1187; 10.1016/j.neuron.2008.06.029; 10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.141409; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.11.042; 10.1016/j.tics.2010.11.004; 10.1038/mp.2015.88; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.11.021; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.03.030; 10.1016/j.bandc.2013.04.005; 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00277; 10.3758/s13415-012-0142-6; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.07.034; 10.1186/2045-5380-2-9; 10.1001/archpsyc.62.6.593; 10.1073/pnas.1308240110; 10.1037/a0024324; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.03.020; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.11.015; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.07.012; 10.3791/3083; 10.1111/psyp.12909; 10.1146/annurev.neuro.24.1.897; 10.1016/j.cub.2011.10.015; 10.1007/s10802-007-9128-1; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.06.026; 10.1111/j.1755-5949.2010.00152.x; 10.1080/00221309.1976.9710867; 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2010.10.015; 10.1038/npp.2014.75; 10.1016/j.acap.2012.04.005; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.08.005; 10.1093/phr/116.5.404; 10.1016/j.amepre.2004.04.007; 10.1037/a0036636; 10.2174/1874440001307010041; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.12.048; 10.1001/archpsyc.62.5.554; 10.2105/AJPH.2012.300931",NA,"Department of Psychology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA."

Animal research demonstrates exposure to stress during gestation has effects on brain structure. In humans, however, little is known about the enduring effects of in utero exposure to maternal stress on brain morphology. We examine whether maternal report of stressful events during pregnancy is associated with brain structure and behavior in adolescents. We compare gray matter morphometry of typically-developing early adolescents (11-14 years of age, mean 12.7) at a single timepoint, based on presence/absence of retrospectively-assessed maternal report of negative major life event stress (MLES) during pregnancy: prenatal stress (PS; n&#x202f;=&#x202f;28), comparison group (CG; n&#x202f;=&#x202f;55). The Drug Use Screening Inventory Revised (DUSI-R) assessed adolescent risk for problematic behaviors. Exclusionary criteria included pre-term birth, low birth weight, and maternal substance use during pregnancy. Groups were equivalent for demographic (age, sex, IQ, SES, race/ethnicity), and birth measures (weight, length). Compared to CG peers, adolescents in the PS group exhibited increased gray matter density in bilateral posterior parietal cortex (PPC): bilateral intraparietal sulcus, left superior parietal lobule and inferior parietal lobule. Additionally, the PS group displayed greater risk for psychiatric symptoms and family system dysfunction, as assessed via DUSI-R subscales. These preliminary findings suggest that prenatal exposure to maternal MLES may exact enduring associations on offspring brain morphology and psychiatric risk, highlighting the importance of capturing these data in prospective longitudinal research studies (beginning at birth) to elucidate these associations.",2019,12,16,"Behavioural brain research","10.1016/j.bbr.2019.112145","PMC10561894","Behav Brain Res","eng","D000293; D000328; D001921; D002648; D005260; D006801; D008279; D008297; D018811; D009035; D010296; D011247; D011297; D011446; D012189; D013315; D019966","Adolescent; Adult; Brain; Child; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Maternal Exposure; Mothers; Parietal Lobe; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; Stress, Psychological; Substance-Related Disorders","5F31AA023462-02; 5P30HD040677-15; R01 AA019983; 1R01AA019983-01; 3R01AA019983-02S1","10.1016/S0736-5748(98)00028-8.; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.11.009; 10.1007/s11096-018-0598-8; 10.1002/dev.10063; 10.1016/S0006-3223(03)00698-X; 10.1016/0165-3806(90)90002-G; 10.1006/HBEH.1994.1030; 10.1097/01.wnr.0000236849.53682.6d; 10.1016/S0361-9230(96)00293-6; 10.1002/jnr.20758; 10.1111/1467-8624.00020.; 10.1002/dev.420260506; 10.1016/0024-3205(88)90561-9; 10.1016/S0149-7634(03)00014-9; 10.1016/0031-9384(91)90538-Y.; 10.1046/j.1460-9568.1999.00705.x; 10.1007/s10803-005-5037-8; 10.1080/10253890500108391; 10.1016/J.EARLHUMDEV.2011.06.007; 10.1192/bjp.172.4.324; 10.1016/J.PSYNEUEN.2011.12.016; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2004.10.010; 10.1038/sj.npp.1301450; 10.1016/J.NEUBIOREV.2017.07.003; 10.3109/15622975.2014.903336; 10.1016/J.BIOPSYCH.2013.06.019; 10.1016/J.PSYNEUEN.2009.07.010; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.06.025; 10.1016/J.BIOPSYCH.2015.12.004; 10.1073/pnas.1201295109; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2014.14030313; 10.1016/J.TICS.2015.07.008; 10.3390/brainsci9030065; 10.1016/J.BRAINRES.2011.05.018; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1798-04.2004; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3302-16.2017; 10.1093/cercor/bhr018; 10.1016/J.NEUROIMAGE.2016.07.044; 10.1016/J.NEUROIMAGE.2010.03.004; 10.1073/pnas.0402680101; 10.1016/J.NEUROIMAGE.2014.10.005; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3550-16.2017; 10.1001/archpsyc.1987.01800190080012; 10.1038/nrn2513; 10.1016/J.TINS.2008.01.004; 10.1016/S0193-953X(01)00003-X; 10.1016/S0149-7634(03)00007-1; 10.1016/J.NEUBIOREV.2016.07.012; 10.1176/jnp.2008.20.3.292; 10.1016/S0149-7634(03)00005-8; 10.1016/J.PNEUROBIO.2016.05.005; 10.1017/S0954579417001730; 10.1017/S095457941800069X; 10.1017/S0954579418000342; 10.1016/J.CLINPH.2009.04.003; 10.3389/fnhum.2016.00296; 10.1176/ajp.156.6.908; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181c484dc; 10.3109/00952999009001570; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2012.08.017.; 10.1111/j.1530-0277.1994.tb01433.x; 10.1016/0306-4603(94)00058-1; 10.1300/J029v10n04_05; 10.1300/J029v10n04_03; 10.1037/h0080632; 10.1300/J029v03n01_03; 10.1007/BF01537962; 10.1016/1054-139X(93)90004-9; 10.1016/J.JCM.2016.02.012; 10.1006/NIMG.2000.0582; 10.1016/J.NEUROIMAGE.2010.08.049; 10.1016/J.SINY.2005.05.003; 10.2307/1602514; 10.1353/dem.2002.0015; 10.1016/J.BBI.2009.02.001; 10.1097/00004583-200106000-00007; 10.1016/J.NEUBIOREV.2005.04.005; 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-050212-185610; 10.1016/J.ALCOHOL.2009.10.003; 10.1038/13158; 10.1073/pnas.201243998; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2006.06.001; 10.1016/J.NEUROIMAGE.2004.01.041; 10.1016/J.NEUROIMAGE.2003.08.003; 10.1016/J.NEUROIMAGE.2005.04.045; 10.1016/0378-3782(77)90015-9; 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14842-8; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.21-22-08819.2001; 10.1002/hbm.23154; 10.1016/J.NEUROIMAGE.2013.05.065; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00727.x; 10.1203/01.pdr.0000191143.75673.52; 10.1016/J.BIOPSYCH.2010.05.028; 10.3389/fpsyg.2010.00223; 10.1017/S0033291713000780; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2007.20; 10.1016/J.PSYCHRES.2015.12.026; 10.1038/13154; 10.1007/s11682-018-0027-6; 10.1016/j.clp.2011.06.007; 10.5580/2732; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.0097; 10.3109/0167482X.2012.673040; 10.1111/j.1399-3038.2012.01346.x; 10.3109/00207459509015297; 10.1073/pnas.1107759108; 10.1002/dev.20316; 10.1016/j.ajog.2008.03.006; 10.1016/J.YHBEH.2008.11.006.; 10.1016/J.CONCOG.2008.11.008; 10.1111/ppe.12051; 10.1007/BF00979226; 10.1002/jts.2490090210; 10.1186/s12884-015-0597-x.; 10.1016/J.SCHRES.2004.04.004; 10.1007/s10654-008-9268-9.; 10.1371/journal.pone.0181794; 10.1016/J.EARLHUMDEV.2006.09.015; 10.1186/1471-2288-12-179; 10.1016/J.JPSYCHORES.2013.07.009; 10.1007/s11920-018-0961-4; 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-050718; 10.1038/s41386-018-0111-z; 10.1093/brain/119.5.1763; 10.1016/J.BIOPSYCH.2013.10.004; 10.1093/ije/dyu225; 10.1017/S0033291714001469; 10.1038/sj.npp.1300528; 10.1007/s00213-010-2009-2.","Declaration of Competing Interest.

The present study aims to assess the rates, characteristics and risk factors of aggressive behavior in first episode psychosis patients (FEP). We conducted a retrospective chart review of 449 FEP patients recruited from an outpatient early psychosis clinic. Aggressive behavior and clinical information were rated based upon information gathered from the chart review of data collected at baseline and after 6&#x202f;months of follow-up. Rates of aggressive behavior were 54.3% in FEP patients. Aggressive behavior was significantly associated with higher rates of history of birth complications, neurodevelopmental delays, learning difficulties, alcohol use disorders, and the clinical domain of poverty symptoms. In addition to aggressive behavior, 16.7% of FEP patients exhibited suicidal ideation or behaviors and 11.4% exhibited non-suicidal self-injurious behavior (NSSIB). In contrast to baseline, aggressive behaviors at 6&#x202f;months follow up were almost entirely absent. Patients at early stages of psychosis have high rates of aggressive and suicidal behavior prior to contact with clinical services. Neurodevelopmental adversities, alcohol use disorders and poverty symptoms are associated to higher risk of aggression in early psychosis. Participation in early psychosis specialty care resulted in a dramatic reduction in aggressive behavior.",2019,10,1,"Schizophrenia research","10.1016/j.schres.2019.07.045","PMC7259809","Schizophr Res","eng","D000293; D000328; D000374; D000437; D015897; D005260; D005500; D006801; D008297; D065886; D011203; D011618; D012189; D012307; D016728; D059020; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Aggression; Alcoholism; Comorbidity; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Poverty; Psychotic Disorders; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Self-Injurious Behavior; Suicidal Ideation; Young Adult","T32 HD091059","NA","Conflict of interest.

The purpose of this study was to test a novel intervention that was personalized and family-based in a Latino population to reduce childhood obesity. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Competency-Based Approaches to Community Health (COACH) was a randomized controlled trial. Latino parent<b>-</b>child pairs were recruited from community settings in Nashville, TN. Child eligibility criteria included age 3-5 years and a BMI &#x2265;50th percentile. The intervention included 15 weekly, 90-minute sessions followed by 3 months of twice-monthly health coaching calls. The control group was a twice-monthly school readiness curriculum for 3 months. Sessions were conducted by a health coach in local community centers, with groups of 8-11 parent<b>-</b>child pairs.

The aim of the study was to explore the socio-economic status of households with a person with severe mental disorder (SMD; psychosis or bipolar disorder) or depression compared to households without an affected person. A population-based, comparative, cross-sectional household survey was conducted in Sodo district, south Ethiopia, between January and November 2015. Two samples were recruited, each with its own comparison group. Sample (1): households of 290 community-ascertained persons with a clinician-confirmed diagnosis of SMD and a comparison group of 289 households without a person with SMD. Sample (2): households of 128 people who attended the primary health care centre and who were identified by primary care staff as having a probable diagnosis of depressive disorder; and comparison households of 129 patients who attended for other reasons and who did not receive a diagnosis of depression. Household socioeconomic status (household income, consumption and asset-based wealth) was assessed using a contextualized version of theWorld Health Organization (WHO) Study on global Ageing and adult health (SAGE) questionnaire. Each disorder group (SMD and depression) was further divided into higher and lower disability groups on the basis of median score on the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule. Households of a person with SMD who had higher disability were more likely to have a poorer living standard (no toilet facility; p&#xa0;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Having a reliable source of regular income was significantly lower in households of a person with SMD (p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.008) or depression (p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.046) with higher disability than the comparison group. Households of persons with SMD with higher disability earned less (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005) and owned significantly fewer assets (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) than households without SMD. Households including persons with depression who had higher disability had lower income (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.042) and reduced consumption (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.048). Households with a member who had either SMD or depression were socioeconomically disadvantaged compared to the general population. Moreover, higher disability was associated with worse socio-economic disadvantage. Prospective studies are needed to determine the direction of association.

Yet, no published work has assessed how these factors affect early brain development in developing countries. This pilot study examined effects of maternal psychopathology and education on early neurocognitive development in a sample of adolescent mothers (N&#xa0;= 50, final n&#xa0;= 31) and their infants living in poverty in S&#xe3;o Paulo, Brazil. Maternal symptoms of anxiety, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and education level were assessed during pregnancy. Infant neurocognitive development was assessed at 6 months of age, with oscillatory power and functional connectivity in the theta (4-6 Hz), alpha (6-9 Hz), and gamma (30-50 Hz) frequencies derived from resting-state electroencephalography; temperament (negative affect, attention, and regulation); and cognitive, language, and motor skills. Cluster-based permutation testing and graph-theoretical methods were used to identify alterations in oscillatory power and connectivity that were associated with maternal psychopathology and education. Correlations between power and connectivity alterations were examined in relation to infants' overt cognitive behavioral abilities. Increased maternal anxiety and lower maternal education were associated with weaker oscillatory connectivity in alpha-range networks. Infants with the weakest connectivity in the alpha network associated with maternal anxiety also showed the lowest cognitive ability. Greater maternal anxiety and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were associated with increased absolute and relative theta power. Our findings highlight the importance of addressing maternal psychopathology and improving education in poor adolescent mothers to prevent negative effects on infant neurodevelopment.",2019,10,1,"Biological psychiatry.

Whether these associations generalize beyond the US prescription environment and to familial mental health and socioeconomic status (SES) has not been examined comprehensively. This study estimated associations of diverse preexisting mental health diagnoses, parental mental health history, and SES in childhood with opioid analgesic prescription patterns nationwide in Sweden. Using register-based data, we identified 5,071,193 (48.4% female) adolescents and adults who were naive to prescription opioid analgesics and followed them from 2007 to 2014. The cumulative incidence of any dispensed opioid analgesic within 3 years was 11.4% (95% CI, 11.3%-11.4%). Individuals with preexisting self-injurious behavior, as well as opioid and other substance use, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, depressive, anxiety, and bipolar disorders had greater opioid therapy initiation rates than did individuals without the respective conditions (hazard ratios from 1.24 [1.20-1.27] for bipolar disorder to 2.12 [2.04-2.21] for opioid use disorder). Among 1,298,083 opioid recipients, the cumulative incidence of long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) was 7.6% (7.6%-7.7%) within 3 years of initiation. All mental health conditions were associated with greater LTOT rates (hazard ratios from 1.66 [1.56-1.77] for bipolar disorder to 3.82 [3.51-4.15] for opioid use disorder) and were similarly associated with concurrent benzodiazepine-opioid therapy. Among 1,482,462 adolescents and young adults, initiation and LTOT rates were greater for those with parental mental health history or lower childhood SES.

We conducted a retrospective observational study using data from the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Registry (GWTG-Stroke) between January 2015 and March 2017. The study included 118,683 ischemic stroke patients age &#x2265;18 who were transported by emergency medical services to one of 1,489 US hospitals. We defined each patient's SES based on zip code median household income. We calculated the driving time between each patient's home zip code and the hospital where he or she was treated using the Google Maps Directions Application Programing Interface. The primary outcomes were tPA administration and onset-to-arrival time (OTA). Outcomes were analyzed using hierarchical multivariable logistic regression models. SES was not associated with OTA (<i>p</i> = 0.31) or tPA administration (<i>p</i> = 0.47), but was associated with the secondary outcomes of onset-to-treatment time (OTT) (<i>p</i> = 0.0160) and in-hospital mortality (<i>p</i> = 0.0037), with higher SES associated with shorter OTT and lower in-hospital mortality. Driving time was associated with tPA administration (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and OTA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), with lower odds of tPA (0.83, 0.79-0.88) and longer OTA (1.30, 1.24-1.35) in patients with the longest vs shortest driving time quartiles.

"31303263","Comparing Within- and Between-Family Polygenic Score Prediction.","Saskia Selzam, Stuart J Ritchie, Jean-Baptiste Pingault, Chandra A Reynolds, Paul F O'Reilly, Robert Plomin","Polygenic scores are a popular tool for prediction of complex traits. However, prediction estimates in samples of unrelated participants can include effects of population stratification, assortative mating, and environmentally mediated parental genetic effects, a form of genotype-environment correlation (rGE). Comparing genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) predictions in unrelated individuals with predictions between siblings in a within-family design is a powerful approach to identify these different sources of prediction. Here, we compared within- to between-family GPS predictions of eight outcomes (anthropometric, cognitive, personality, and health) for eight corresponding GPSs. The outcomes were assessed in up to 2,366 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study from age 12 to age 21. To account for family clustering, we used mixed-effects modeling, simultaneously estimating within- and between-family effects for target- and cross-trait GPS prediction of the outcomes. There were three main findings: (1) DZ twin GPS differences predicted DZ differences in height, BMI, intelligence, educational achievement, and ADHD symptoms; (2) target and cross-trait analyses indicated that GPS prediction estimates for cognitive traits (intelligence and educational achievement) were on average 60% greater between families than within families, but this was not the case for non-cognitive traits; and (3) much of this within- and between-family difference for cognitive traits disappeared after controlling for family socio-economic status (SES), suggesting that SES is a major source of between-family prediction through rGE mechanisms. These results provide insights into the patterns by which rGE contributes to GPS prediction, while ruling out confounding due to population stratification and assortative mating.",2019,8,1,"American journal of human genetics","10.1016/j.ajhg.2019.06.006","PMC6698881","Am J Hum Genet","</AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Reynolds</LastName><ForeName>Chandra A</ForeName><Initials>CA</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, University of California Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>O'Reilly</LastName><ForeName>Paul F</ForeName><Initials>PF</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London SE5 8AF, UK; Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Plomin</LastName><ForeName>Robert</ForeName><Initials>R</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London SE5 8AF, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng","D000293; D000328; D002648; D003071; D003072; D004200; D004522; D005190; D005260; D005796; D020022; D055106; D005838; D006801; D008297; D020412; D065886; D010641; D020641; D012559; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Cognition; Cognition Disorders; Diseases in Twins; Educational Status; Family; Female; Genes; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Male; Multifactorial Inheritance; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Schizophrenia; Young Adult","295366; MR/N015746/1; G0901245; R01 AG046938; G19/2; MR/M021475/1","NA","The authors declare no competing interests.","Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London SE5 8AF, UK."

The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence and intensity of catastrophic out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditure, level of impoverishment and coping strategies used by households of persons with and without depression in a rural Ethiopian district. A comparative cross-sectional survey was conducted, including 128 households of persons with depression and 129 households without. Depression screening was conducted using the Patient Health Questionnaire, nine item version (PHQ-9). People in the depression group were classified into high and low disability groups based on the median value on the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) polytomous summary score. Health expenditure greater than thresholds of 10 and 25% of total household consumption was used for the primary analyses. The poverty headcount, poverty gap and normalized poverty gap were estimated using retrospective recall of total household expenditure pre- and post-OOP payments for health care. Linear probability model using binreg command in STATA with rr option was used to estimate risk ratio for the occurrence of outcomes among households with and without depression based on level of disability. Catastrophic OOP payments at any threshold level for households with depression and high disability were higher than control households. At the 10% threshold level, 24.0% of households of persons with depression and high disability faced catastrophic payments compared with 15.3% for depression and low disability and 12.1% for control households (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.041). Depression and high disability level was an independent predictor of catastrophic OOP payments: RR 2.1; 95% CI:1.1, 4.6. An estimated 5.8% of households of persons with depression and high disability were pushed into poverty because of paying for health care compared with 3.5% for households of persons with depression and low disability and 2.3% for control households (p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.039). Households of people with depression and high disability were more likely to face catastrophic expenditures and impoverishment from OOP payments.

Prior reviews of sexual violence prevalence rates have produced wide-ranging estimates, likely due to wide variation in measurement strategies. This article systematically reviewed research findings (from 2000 to 2017) regarding prevalence rates of sexual perpetration in college men and measurement strategies. Data Sources: PsycINFO and Web of Science databases. Eligibility Criteria: Empirical reports published between 2000 and 2017 that included male participants, available in English, and reported lifetime prevalence findings in Canadian or American college students. Participants: Data from 78 independent samples including 25,524 college men. The average prevalence rate of any sexual perpetration was 29.3% (<i>SD</i> = 16.8), and the average rate of rape was 6.5% (<i>SD</i> = 6.3). Studies that used non-Sexual Experiences Survey (SES)-based questionnaires recorded higher prevalence rates (41.5%) than SES-using studies (26.2%). At least 16 different sexual perpetration questionnaires were identified. Modifying standardized questionnaires was extremely common; this was reported in over half of the studies. Studies using modified standardized questionnaires found higher prevalence rates of sexual perpetration than studies using nonmodified standardized questionnaires. This report focused exclusively on college men in the United States and Canada. On average, 29% of college males report engaging in behaviors defined as sexual perpetration; however, there was a strong influence of measurement strategy on reported rates.",2021,7,1,"Trauma, violence &amp; abuse","10.1177/1524838019860619",NA,"Trauma Violence Abuse","eng","D002170; D006801; D008297; D015995; D012742; D014481; D014495","Canada; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Sex Offenses; United States; Universities","K01 AA026643; L30 AA027043","NA",NA,"Department of Psychological Sciences, Kent State University, Kent, OH, USA."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the research productivity of low-income countries (LICs) and low- to middle-income countries (LMICs) in selected journals representing the worldwide neurosurgical data and their ability to report and communicate globally the existing differences between high-income countries (HICs) and LMICs. We performed a retrospective bibliometric analysis using PubMed and Scopus databases to record all the reports from 2015 to 2017 by investigators affiliated with neurosurgical departments in LICs and LMICs. A total of 8459 reports by investigators self-identified as members of neurosurgery departments worldwide were identified. Of these, 6708 reports were included in accordance with our method in the final analysis. The systematic search resulted in 459 studies reported by LICs and LMICs. Of these, 334 reports were included for the full text evaluation. Of the 6708 reports, 303 (4.52%) had been reported with an LMIC affiliation and only 31 (0.46%) with an LIC. The leading countries were India with 182 (54.5% among LMICs and LICs; 2.71% overall), followed by Egypt at 66 (19.76% among the LMICs and LICs; 0.98% overall), with a large difference compared with other countries such as Uganda at 9 (2.69% among the LMICs and LICs) and Tunisia and Pakistan at 8 each (2.4% among the LMICs and LICs). A few reports studies had been generated by collaboration with HIC neurosurgeons. Our results have shown that research studies from LMICs are underrepresented. Understanding and discussing the reasons for this underrepresentation are necessary to start addressing the disparities in neurosurgical research and care capacity.

We attempted to replicate this association using data from the Duke Neurogenetics Study. Our replication attempt was made in a subsample of 520 non-Hispanic Caucasian volunteers (277 women, mean age 19.78&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.24&#xa0;years). The DA polygenic score was based on the following five loci: rs27072 (SLC6A3/DAT1), rs4532 (DRD1), rs1800497 (DRD2/ANKK1), rs6280 (DRD3), and rs4680 (COMT). Because the discovery sample in the original study consisted mostly of Asian participants, we also conducted a post hoc analysis in a smaller subsample of Asian volunteers (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;316, 179 women, mean age 19.61&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.32&#xa0;years). In the primary sample of non-Hispanic Caucasians, a linear regression analysis controlling for sex, age, socioeconomic status (SES), body mass index, genetic ancestry, and both early and recent life stress, revealed that higher DA polygenic scores were associated with higher self-reported symptoms of depression. This was in contrast to the original association of higher DA polygenic scores and lower depressive symptoms. However, the direction of the association in our Asian subsample was consistent with this original finding. Our results also suggested that compared to the Asian subsample, the non-Hispanic Caucasian subsample was characterized by higher SES, lower early and recent life stress, and lower depressive symptoms. These differences may have contributed to the observed divergence in associations. Collectively, the current findings add to evidence that specific genetic associations may differ between populations and further encourage explicit modeling of race/ethnicity in examining the polygenic nature of depressive symptoms and depression.",2020,3,1,"European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience","10.1007/s00406-019-01040-x",NA,"Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci","eng","D000293; D000328; D044466; D002394; D003863; D050483; D005260; D006801; D008297; D020412; D011954; D017447; D017448; D050637; D044465; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Asian People; Catechol O-Methyltransferase; Depression; Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; Female; Humans; Male; Multifactorial Inheritance; Receptors, Dopamine; Receptors, Dopamine D1; Receptors, Dopamine D2; Receptors, Dopamine D3; White People; Young Adult","S10 OD018164; R01DA031579; R01AG049789; R01DA033369","NA",NA,"Laboratory of NeuroGenetics, Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA."

While prior work has mapped the associations between neighborhood SES and brain structure, little is known about the relationship between SES and intrinsic neural dynamics. Here, we capitalize upon a large cross-sectional community-based sample (Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, ages 8-22&#xa0;years, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1012) to examine associations between age, SES, and functional brain network topology. We characterize this topology using a local measure of network segregation known as the clustering coefficient and find that it accounts for a greater degree of SES-associated variance than mesoscale segregation captured by modularity. High-SES youth displayed stronger positive associations between age and clustering than low-SES youth, and this effect was most pronounced for regions in the limbic, somatomotor, and ventral attention systems. The moderating effect of SES on positive associations between age and clustering was strongest for connections of intermediate length and was consistent with a stronger negative relationship between age and local connectivity in these regions in low-SES youth.

"31206150","Social Inequalities in Harmful Drinking and Alcohol-Related Problems Among Swedish Adolescents.","Siri Thor, Patrik Karlsson, Jonas Landberg","The study aims to examine how socio-economic status (SES) among youth is related to binge-drinking and alcohol-related problems using three SES indicators: (i) SES of origin (parental education level), (ii) SES of the school environment (average parental education level at student's school) and (iii) SES of destination (academic orientation). Cross-sectional data on upper secondary students (n= 4448) in Sweden. Multilevel logistic and negative binomial regression were used to estimate the relationship between each SES indicator and binge-drinking and alcohol-related problems, respectively. Only SES of destination was significantly associated with binge-drinking, with higher odds for students in vocational programmes (OR= 1.42, 95% CI= 1.13-1.80). For the second outcome, SES of destination (rr=1.25; 95%CI=1.08-1.45) and SES of the school environment (rr=1.19, 95% CI=1.02-1.39) indicated more alcohol-related problems in vocational programmes and in schools with lower-educated parents. After adjustment for drinking patterns, the relationship remained for SES of the school environment, but became non-significant for SES of destination. Our results suggest that the SES gradient among youth is stronger for alcohol-related problems than for harmful drinking. By only focusing on SES differences in harmful alcohol use, researchers may underestimate the social inequalities in adverse alcohol-related outcomes among young people.

"31204636","The moderating effects of traumatic stress on vulnerability to emotional distress during pregnancy.","Irene Tung, Kate Keenan, Stephanie D Stepp, Alison E Hipwell","Emotional distress during pregnancy is likely influenced by both maternal history of adversity and concurrent prenatal stressors, but prospective longitudinal studies are lacking. Guided by a life span model of pregnancy health and stress sensitization theories, this study investigated the influence of intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy on the association between childhood adversity and prenatal emotional distress. Participants included an urban, community-based sample of 200 pregnant women (aged 18-24) assessed annually from ages 8 to 17 for a range of adversity domains, including traumatic violence, harsh parenting, caregiver loss, and compromised parenting. Models tested both linear and nonlinear effects of adversity as well as their interactions with IPV on prenatal anxiety and depression symptoms, controlling for potential confounds such as poverty and childhood anxiety and depression. Results showed that the associations between childhood adversity and pregnancy emotional distress were moderated by prenatal IPV, supporting a life span conceptualization of pregnancy health.

This is a secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial among 384 women living in Khayelitsha, a low income setting in South Africa, recruited at their first antenatal visit if they scored 13 or above on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, were at least 18&#x2009;years of age, less than 29&#x2009;weeks pregnant and spoke isiXhosa. Participants were followed up at 8&#x2009;months gestation, 3 and 12&#x2009;months postpartum. Latent trajectories of depressive symptoms were identified using growth mixture modelling, based on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). There were no differences in HDRS scores between the control and intervention arms, so all participants were assessed together. Health, social and economic predictors of trajectories were investigated to identify high-risk groups with greater or more chronic depressive symptoms, using univariate logistic regression. Two trajectories were identified: antenatal only (91.4%), with moderate to severe symptoms at baseline which later subside; and antenatal and postnatal (8.6%), with severe depressive symptoms during pregnancy and later in the postpartum period, which subside temporarily to moderate levels at 3&#x2009;months postpartum. Predictors for the antenatal and postnatal trajectory include severe food insecurity, intimate partner violence, lower social support, greater functional impairment, problematic drinking and suicide risk. A small proportion of women who are at risk for depression antenatally remain at risk throughout the perinatal period, and can be differentiated from those who show a natural remission. Identification and referral strategies should be developed with these findings in mind, especially given the limited mental health resources in low-income settings.",2019,6,14,"BMC pregnancy and childbirth","10.1186/s12884-019-2355-y","PMC6570971","BMC Pregnancy Childbirth","eng","D000328; D003863; D019052; D005260; D006801; D011203; D011247; D011248; D011379; D011569; D018570; D012307; D013019","Adult; Depression; Depression, Postpartum; Female; Humans; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prognosis; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; South Africa","U19 MH095699","NA","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Alan J Flisher Centre for Public Mental Health, Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa."

The authors investigated whether childhood experience of abuse (e.g. physical, emotional and sexual abuse) and neglect (physical and emotional deprivation) was differentially associated with neural reactivity to threat. Participants were drawn from an existing study and allocated to one of four groups based on self-report of childhood maltreatment experience: individuals with childhood abuse experiences (n = 70); individuals with childhood neglect experiences (n = 87); individuals with combined experience of childhood abuse and neglect (n = 50); and non-maltreated individuals (n = 207) propensity score matched (PSM) on gender, age, IQ, psychopathology and SES. Neural reactivity to facial cues signalling threat was compared across groups, allowing the differential effects associated with particular forms of maltreatment experience to be isolated. Brain imaging analyses indicated that while childhood abuse was associated with heightened localised threat reactivity in ventral amygdala, experiences of neglect were associated with heightened reactivity in a distributed cortical fronto-parietal network supporting complex social and cognitive processing as well as in the dorsal amygdala. Unexpectedly, combined experiences of abuse and neglect were associated with hypo-activation in several higher-order cortical regions as well as the amygdala. Different forms of childhood maltreatment exert differential effects in neural threat reactivity: while the effects of abuse are more focal, the effects of neglect and combined experiences of abuse are more distributed. These findings are relevant for understanding the range of psychiatric outcomes following childhood maltreatment and have implications for intervention.",2020,6,1,"Psychological medicine","10.1017/S003329171900134X",NA,"Psychol Med","</AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families, Kantor Centre of Excellence, 4-8 Rodney Street, LondonN1 9JH, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Viding</LastName><ForeName>Essi</ForeName><Initials>E</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London, 26 Bedford Way, WC1H 0AP, London, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Gerin</LastName><ForeName>Mattia Indi</ForeName><Initials>MI</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London, 26 Bedford Way, WC1H 0AP, London, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Pingault</LastName><ForeName>Jean-Baptiste</ForeName><Initials>JB</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London, 26 Bedford Way, WC1H 0AP, London, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Sethi</LastName><ForeName>Arjun</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London, 26 Bedford Way, WC1H 0AP, London, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Knodt</LastName><ForeName>Annchen R</ForeName><Initials>AR</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Laboratory of NeuroGenetics, Duke University, Durham, NC27708, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Radtke</LastName><ForeName>Spenser R</ForeName><Initials>SR</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Laboratory of NeuroGenetics, Duke University, Durham, NC27708, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Brigidi</LastName><ForeName>Bart D</ForeName><Initials>BD</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Laboratory of NeuroGenetics, Duke University, Durham, NC27708, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Hariri</LastName><ForeName>Ahmad R</ForeName><Initials>AR</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Laboratory of NeuroGenetics, Duke University, Durham, NC27708, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>McCrory</LastName><ForeName>Eamon</ForeName><Initials>E</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London, 26 Bedford Way, WC1H 0AP, London, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families, Kantor Centre of Excellence, 4-8 Rodney Street, LondonN1 9JH, UK.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng","D000293; D054523; D000679; D002649; D003463; D000066499; D005260; D006801; D008279; D008297; D057216; D013315; D055815","Adolescent; Adult Survivors of Child Abuse; Amygdala; Child Abuse; Cues; Facial Recognition; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Propensity Score; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult","S10 OD018164; R01 DA033369; R01 DA031579; R01 AG049789","NA",NA,"Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London, 26 Bedford Way, WC1H 0AP, London, UK."

This study aimed to estimate the incidence and intensity of catastrophic out-of-pocket (OOP) payments and coping strategies implemented by households with and without a person with SMD in a rural district of Ethiopia. A comparative cross-sectional community household survey was carried out from January to November 2015 as part of the Emerald programme (emerging mental health systems in low- and middle-income countries). A sample of 290 households including a person with SMD and 289 comparison households without a person with SMD participated in the study. An adapted and abbreviated version of the World Health Organization SAGE (Study on global Ageing and adult health) survey instrument was used. Households were considered to have incurred catastrophic health expenditure if their annual OOP health expenditures exceeded 40% of their annual non-food expenditure. Multiple logistic regression was used to explore factors associated with catastrophic expenditure and types of coping strategies employed. The incidence of catastrophic OOP payments in the preceding 12&#xa0;months was 32.2% for households of a person with SMD and 18.2% for comparison households (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006). In households containing a person with SMD, there was a significant increase in the odds of hardship financial coping strategies (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001): reducing medical visits, cutting down food consumption, and withdrawing children from school. Households of a person with SMD were also less satisfied with their financial status and perceived their household income to be insufficient to meet their livelihood needs (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Catastrophic OOP health expenditures in households of a person with SMD are high and associated with hardship financial coping strategies which may lead to poorer health outcomes, entrenchment of poverty and intergenerational disadvantage. Policy interventions aimed at financial risk pooling mechanisms are crucial to reduce the intensity and impact of OOP payments among vulnerable households living with SMD and support the goal of universal health coverage.",2019,1,1,"International journal of mental health systems","10.1186/s13033-019-0294-7","PMC6544918","Int J Ment Health Syst","eng",NA,NA,"001; MR/M025470/1","10.1093/heapol/czl004; 10.1186/s12939-017-0657-0; 10.1371/journal.pone.0056873; 10.4269/ajtmh.2004.71.147; 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13861-5; 10.1016/S0305-750X(02)00217-6; 10.1016/j.worlddev.2005.08.003; 10.1046/j.1365-3156.2003.01194.x; 10.1016/S0140-6736(01)05975-X; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.07.001; 10.1002/hec.1338; 10.2471/BLT.07.049403; 10.1257/jep.9.3.103; 10.1016/0277-9536(95)00375-4; 10.1377/hlthaff.28.4.1056; 10.1016/j.healthpol.2005.09.008; 10.1016/j.jhealeco.2006.07.001; 10.1371/journal.pone.0047423; 10.2471/BLT.06.033720; 10.1086/423255; 10.1093/jae/eji022; 10.1186/s12916-015-0309-4; 10.1371/journal.pone.0088437; 10.1192/bjp.bp.114.153676; 10.1177/002076402128783244; 10.1002/mpr.1382; 10.1186/1471-244X-14-194; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2011.02836.x; 10.1002/hec.776; 10.1186/s12955-017-0647-3; 10.1016/S2214-109X(17)30429-1; 10.1177/1077558709345499; 10.1034/j.1399-5618.2002.01148.x; 10.1186/s12889-015-2099-1; 10.1097/MD.0000000000001410; 10.1186/s12939-017-0526-x; 10.1136/jech-2014-204960; 10.1016/j.healthpol.2004.01.003; 10.1186/2049-9957-2-21; 10.1016/j.healthpol.2004.06.006; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2007.01825.x; 10.1136/bmjgh-2016-000166; 10.1016/j.ygyno.2006.12.010; 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018916; 10.1017/s2045796017000701; 10.1111/tmi.12546; 10.1186/s12913-015-0833-0; 10.1111/j.1552-3934.2010.02052.x; 10.1370/afm.1444; 10.1111/j.1470-6431.2005.00449.x; 10.1162/rest.89.3.534; 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006355","Competing interestsThis study is part of a Ph.D. research and the source of the funding is partially from Addis Ababa University.

A multi-methods approach was developed and applied, consisting of three steps: a situational analysis of Nigeria's health system, macro-fiscal economic profile, and socio-political status, including a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis of the Nigerian socio-economic, general and mental health context; key informant interviews with 12 expert stakeholders drawn from state and non-state actors in the health and financial sectors; and a policy analysis of sustainable financing options. Key challenges identified were: poor funding; reduced access to care, resulting in a huge treatment gap; and out of pocket payment for services-leading to impoverishment. Comprehensive coverage of mental health conditions within the ongoing health insurance reforms was identified as a key strategy for moving towards sustainable mental health financing in Nigeria. Other identified strategies include enhanced integration of mental health into primary care; incorporation of mental health into other strategic and currently funded programmes; adoption of performance-based financing measures; and renewed engagement with stakeholders, including external donor institutions. A suite of feasible and actionable measures can be implemented to increase mental health service financing, reduce health-related financial burden on households, increase help-seeking and access to quality mental health care and, ultimately, reduce the large treatment and financing gap for mental disorders in Nigeria.",2019,1,1,"International journal of mental health systems","10.1186/s13033-019-0293-8","PMC6543636","Int J Ment Health Syst","eng",NA,NA,"001","10.1001/jama.291.21.2581; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.04.027; 10.1093/heapol/czl003; 10.1093/heapol/czl004; 10.2105/AJPH.89.9.1315; 10.1007/s00127-012-0587-5; 10.1186/s12916-015-0309-4; 10.1017/S2045796016000408; 10.1192/bjp.188.5.465; 10.1186/s12913-015-0911-3","Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.","1Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."
"31162456","When Irrational Biases Are Smart: A Fuzzy-Trace Theory of Complex Decision Making.","Valerie Reyna","I take a decision-making approach to consider ways of addressing the ""unresolved and dramatic problems in the world"". Traditional approaches to good decision-making are reviewed. These approaches reduce complex decisions to tradeoffs between magnitudes of probabilities, and outcomes in which the quantity and precision of information are key to making good decisions. I discuss a contrasting framework, called ""fuzzy-trace theory"", which emphasizes understanding the simple gist of options and applying core social and moral values. Importantly, the tendency to rely on meaningful but simple gist increases from childhood to adulthood (or, in adulthood, as people gain experience in a domain), so that specific irrational biases grow with knowledge and experience. As predicted theoretically, these violations of rationality in the traditional sense are associated empirically with healthier and more adaptive outcomes. Thus, interventions that help decision makers understand the essential gist of their options and how it connects to core values are practical approaches to reducing ""unresolved and dramatic problems in the world"" one decision at a time.",2018,6,8,"Journal of Intelligence","10.3390/jintelligence6020029","PMC6480760","J Intell","eng",NA,NA,"R21NR016905; SES-1536238; NYC-321407","10.1038/scientificamericanmind1109-34; 10.3390/jintelligence6010004; 10.1111/j.1756-8765.2010.01107.x; 10.1016/j.jarmac.2015.12.003; 10.1037/dec0000083; 10.1177/1529100618760521; 10.1177/0272989X14553472; 10.1001/jama.2018.0899; 10.1016/j.pbb.2017.09.009; 10.1007/s40429-018-0193-z; 10.1080/00029890.1960.11989521; 10.2307/1907921; 10.1086/296365; 10.1037/0022-3514.94.4.672; 10.1016/j.dr.2011.07.004; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.02009.x; 10.1016/j.dcn.2017.07.007; 10.1080/20445911.2016.1256294; 10.1111/j.1529-1006.2006.00026.x; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02104.x; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1994.tb00625.x; 10.1007/s10803-010-0993-z; 10.1037/xlm0000296; 10.1002/bdm.752; 10.1037/hea0000384; 10.1037/a0038088; 10.1037/a0036717; 10.1017/bpp.2016.15; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01720.x; 10.1002/1099-1360(200001/05)9:1/3&lt;76::AID-MCDA268&gt;3.0.CO;2-5; 10.1002/bdm.2059; 10.1007/s11606-017-4099-6; 10.1177/0272989X08327066; 10.1002/acr.21657; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02372.x; 10.1016/j.cogdev.2015.08.001; 10.1037/a0023943; 10.1037/law0000156; 10.1177/0956797613497022; 10.1007/s10802-005-9003-x; 10.1016/j.dr.2013.12.002; 10.1016/j.rasd.2017.11.001; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2895-08.2008; 10.1080/17470218.2017.1344259","The author declares no conflicts of interest.","Department of Human Development, Human Neuroscience Institute, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14850, USA."

A total of 384 adult pregnant women were recruited from two antenatal clinics in an informal settlement near Cape Town, South Africa, and followed up at eight months gestation, and at 3- and 12-month postpartum. The MINI 6.0 Suicidality module and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) were used to measure suicidal risk and depression, respectively. Generalised Estimating Equations were used to assess the association between change in depressive symptoms from one assessment to the next (predictor) and change in suicide score or change in suicidal risk (score&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;9) (outcomes). HDRS scores were positively correlated with suicide score (95% CI 0.35, 0.78; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and with odds of being at moderate risk for suicide, after controlling for risk of suicide at the previous assessment (adjusted odds ratio&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.15; 95% CI 1.09, 1.22; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Age was a significant effect modifier: change in HDRS scores was not associated with change in suicide scores among participants aged 35-45&#xa0;years. Secondary analyses indicated that a decrease in HDRS score was associated with a decrease in suicide scores, but an increase in HDRS score was not associated with change in suicide score.

"31100699","The roles of non-cognitive and cognitive skills in the life course development of adult health inequalities.","Jennifer L Carter, Marcus Richards, Matthew Hotopf, Stephani L Hatch","Previous research has suggested that greater cognitive skill is protective against the development of socioeconomic health inequalities across the life course, but the relative role of non-cognitive skills has been less investigated in this context. Using the prospective UK 1958 National Child Development Study (N&#x202f;=&#x202f;18,558), higher factor scores for adolescent non-cognitive skills (NCS; i.e. a combination of work habits and pro-social behaviours) and mean cognitive skill (CS) at age 16 were examined with a path analysis model in relation to socioeconomic status (SES) across the life course (at ages 16, 33 and 50) and poor self-reported health at age 50. Adjusting for adolescent NCS explained over a third of the association between education and health, but the path between social class at age 50 and health was unaffected. Adjustment for CS explained larger proportions of the paths to adult health inequalities; and paths between CS and SES across the life course were stronger than the same paths with NCS. However, NCS was still independently associated with paths to later health inequalities in fully adjusted models, and both types of skill had equivalent inverse direct effects with poor health (OR: 0.82 [95% CI 0.73,0.93] vs 0.83 [0.72,0.96], respectively). Since NCS retained independent associations with SES and health across the life course, they could be a target for policies aimed at ameliorating the production of health inequalities for a wide range of children, regardless of their cognitive skill.",2019,7,1,"Social science &amp; medicine (1982)","10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.04.041","PMC6783301","Soc Sci Med","eng","D000293; D000328; D003071; D005260; D054624; D006801; D008018; D016014; D016015; D008137; D008297; D008875; D011446; D012923; D006113","Adolescent; Adult; Cognition; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Life Cycle Stages; Linear Models; Logistic Models; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Social Class; United Kingdom","MC_U137686857; MAUBRC-2012-1; MC_UU_12026/3; MC_UU_00019/4; MC_UU_00019/3","NA","<b>Declaration of interest</b>.

"31096943","Multimorbidity and care dependence in older adults: a longitudinal analysis of findings from the 10/66 study.","Jianan Bao, Kia-Chong Chua, Matthew Prina, Martin Prince","In an ageing world facing an epidemic of chronic diseases, there is great interest in the burden of multimorbidity on individuals and caregivers, yet no studies have examined the longitudinal association between multimorbidity and care dependence in low and middle income countries. Mental and cognitive disorders are associated with dependence but little is known about their role in the pathway to dependence in the context of multimorbidity. This study aims to determine (1) the association of multimorbidity with the onset of care dependence in older adults, accounting for mortality and controlling for sociodemographic factors, and (2) the independent effects of physical multimorbidity, mental and cognitive disorders. A population-based cohort study of people aged 65&#x2009;years and older in six countries in Latin America, and China. Data on chronic conditions and sociodemographic factors were collected at baseline. Multimorbidity was ascertained as a count of up to 15 mental, cognitive and physical health conditions. Dependence was ascertained through informant interviews at baseline and follow-up. We used competing risk regression to assess the association between multimorbidity and the onset of care dependence, acknowledging the possibility of dependence-free death. We also assessed the independent effects of physical multimorbidity and depression, anxiety and dementia individually. 12,965 participants, with no needs for care at baseline, were followed up for a median of 3.0-4.9&#x2009;years. Each unit increase in multimorbidity count increased the cumulative risk of dependence by 20% in the fully adjusted model. Age was the only variable to confound this relationship. Physical multimorbidity was associated with only a modest increased risk of care dependence. Dementia, depression and anxiety were independently associated with incident care dependence at every level of physical multimorbidity, and depression and anxiety attenuated the effect of physical multimorbidity. Multimorbidity consistently predicts care dependence with little variation between countries. Physical multimorbidity imparts a lower risk than multimorbidity with mental and cognitive disorders included. Mental and cognitive disorders independently increase the risk of care dependence. Comprehensive and holistic assessment of disorders of body, brain and mind can help to identify older people at high risk of care dependence.",2019,5,16,"BMC public health","10.1186/s12889-019-6961-4","PMC6524243","BMC Public Health","eng","D000368; D000369; D001007; D017028; D002681; D002908; D003072; D015331; D003704; D003863; D003906; D005260; D006801; D007182; D007843; D008137; D008297; D000076322; D011203; D012044","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety; Caregivers; China; Chronic Disease; Cognition Disorders; Cohort Studies; Dementia; Depression; Developing Countries; Female; Humans; Income; Latin America; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Multimorbidity; Poverty; Regression Analysis","IIRG-04-1286; GR080002; GR066133","10.1016/j.arr.2011.03.003; 10.1186/s12916-015-0402-8; 10.7326/0003-4819-139-5_Part_2-200309021-00015; 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61347-7; 10.1186/s12875-015-0345-3; 10.1186/1471-2318-10-53; 10.1371/journal.pone.0195567; 10.1136/bmjspcare-2013-000639; 10.1186/1471-2458-8-285; 10.1111/ggi.12480; 10.1111/jgs.14868; 10.1186/s12916-015-0378-4; 10.1186/s12877-015-0130-0; 10.1186/1471-2318-14-67; 10.1093/gerona/glv128; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60240-2; 10.1371/journal.pone.0015941; 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61002-8; 10.1192/bjp.185.5.429; 10.1017/S0033291711000444; 10.1001/jama.294.22.2879; 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.083915; 10.1002/1099-1166(200006)15:6&lt;521::AID-GPS182&gt;3.0.CO;2-F; 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.02767.x; 10.1371/journal.pone.0127199; 10.1186/1472-6963-11-153; 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61611-6; 10.1371/journal.pone.0177044; 10.1186/s12875-015-0344-4; 10.1371/journal.pone.0142123; 10.1111/jgs.14718; 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30403-8; 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30402-6; 10.1371/journal.pone.0138521; 10.1093/gerona/63.3.298; 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61596-8","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Health Service and Population Research, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."

However, few studies have followed the offspring to retirement age, and relatedly, knowledge about the link between poor family relationships and premature death is scarce. The aim of this study was to examine the association between poor family relationships in adolescence and the risk of premature death, even when considering other adverse childhood conditions. Prospective data from the Stockholm Birth Cohort study were used, with 2636 individuals born in 1953 who were followed up until age 65. Information on family relations was based on interviews with the participants' mothers in 1968. Information on mortality was retrieved from administrative register data from 1969-2018. Cox proportional hazards regressions showed that poor family relationships in adolescence were associated with an increased risk of premature death, even when adjusting for childhood conditions in terms of household social class, household economic poverty, contact with the child services, parental alcohol abuse, and parental mental illness (Hazard Ratio (HR), 2.08, 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.40-3.09).

"31091366","Children's reasoning about continuous causal processes: The role of verbal and non-verbal ability.","Selma D&#xfc;ndar-Coecke, Andrew Tolmie, Anne Schlottmann","Causes produce effects via underlying mechanisms that must be inferred from observable and unobservable structures. Preschoolers show sensitivity to mechanisms in machine-like systems with perceptually distinct causes and effects, but little is known about how children extend causal reasoning to the natural continuous processes studied in elementary school science, or how other abilities impact on this. We investigated the development of children's ability to predict, observe, and explain three causal processes, relevant to physics, biology, and chemistry, taking into account their verbal and non-verbal ability. Children aged 5-11&#xa0;years (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;107) from London and Oxford, with wide ethnic/linguistic variation, drawn from the middle/upper socioeconomic status (SES) range. Children were tested individually on causal tasks focused on sinking, absorption, and dissolving, using a novel approach in which they observed contrasting instances of each, to promote attention to mechanism. Further tasks assessed verbal (expressive vocabulary) and non-verbal (block design) ability. Reports improved with age, though with differences between tasks. Even young participants gave good descriptions of what they observed. Causal explanations were more strongly related to observation than to prediction from prior knowledge, but developed more slowly. Non-verbal but not generic verbal ability predicted performance. Reasoning about continuous processes is within the capacity of children from school entry, even using verbal reports, though they find it easier to address more rapid processes. Mechanism inference is uncommon, with non-verbal ability an important influence on progress.

Two mental health surveys using identical methods and ICD-10 were conducted in 1994 and 2015 (population &#x2265;15 years old, n = 152 776) in the same six townships of Xinjin County, Chengdu, China. Compared with 1994, individuals with SMI in 2015 had significantly higher rates of poor family economic status, fewer family caregivers, longer duration of illness, later age at first onset and poor mental status. Participants in 2015 had significantly higher rates of never being treated, taking antipsychotic drugs and ever being admitted to hospital, and lower rates of using traditional Chinese medicine or being treated by traditional/spiritual healers. The factors strongly associated with never being treated included worse mental status (symptoms/social functioning), older age, having no family caregivers and poor family economic status. Socioeconomic development influences the treatment status of people with SMI in contemporary rural China. Relative poverty, having no family caregivers and older age are important factors associated with a worse treatment status. Culture-specific, community-based interventions and targeted poverty-alleviation programmes should be developed to improve the early identification, treatment and recovery of individuals with SMI in rural China.Declaration of interestNone.",2019,3,1,"BJPsych open","10.1192/bjo.2019.13","PMC6469230","BJPsych Open","eng",NA,NA,"MR/R023697/1","NA",NA,"Professor,Department of Psychiatry,West China Hospital, Sichuan University,China."
"31056844","Brain structure mediates the association between socioeconomic status and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.","Laura Machlin, Katie A McLaughlin, Margaret A Sheridan","Low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with greater risk for symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). One mechanism through which SES may confer risk for ADHD is by influencing brain structure. Alterations to cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volume have been associated with low SES and with the presence of ADHD across multiple studies. The current study examined whether cortical thickness, surface area or subcortical volume mediate the associations between SES and ADHD in youth 3-21&#xa0;years old (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;874) from the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition and Genetics Study. Freesurfer was used to estimate cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volume from structural magnetic resonance imaging. Parents reported on demographics, family SES, ADHD diagnoses and the presence of child attention problems. Statistical mediation was assessed using a bootstrap resampling procedure. Controlling for parental ADHD, child age, gender, birth weight and scanner, children in low SES families were more likely to be in the ADHD group. Consistent with previous reports in this sample, low SES was associated with reduced surface area across the frontal lobe and reduced subcortical volume in the amygdala, cerebellum, hippocampus and basal ganglia. Of these regions, a significant indirect effect of SES on ADHD status through subcortical volume was observed for the left cerebellum (95% confidence interval: 0.004, 0.022), the right cerebellum (95% confidence interval: 0.006, 0.025), and the right caudate (95% confidence interval: 0.002, 0.022). Environmentally mediated changes in the cerebellum and the caudate may be neurodevelopmental mechanisms explaining elevated risk of ADHD in children in low SES families.",2020,1,1,"Developmental science","10.1111/desc.12844","PMC6829027","Dev Sci","eng","D000293; D000679; D001289; D001921; D001931; D002648; D002675; D005260; D005625; D006801; D008279; D008297; D012923; D055815","Adolescent; Amygdala; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Brain; Brain Mapping; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Frontal Lobe; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Social Class; Young Adult","R01 MH106482","10.1037/neu0000001; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.04.026; 10.1016/j.jaac.2009.11.008; 10.1212/WNL.50.4.1087; 10.1038/npp.2015.252; 10.1016/j.jaac.2011.02.014; 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01799.x; 10.3389/fnins.2014.00276; 10.1016/j.bandc.2017.03.007; 10.3109/15622970209150624; 10.1016/j.neulet.2005.07.020; 10.1001/jama.288.14.1740; 10.1016/j.tics.2011.11.007; 10.1007/s12311-013-0497-4; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.04.035; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.01.021; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.06.010; 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2006.01.014; 10.1002/mrdd.10079; 10.1097/00004583-200403000-00016; 10.1111/1467-7687.00235; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.07.037; 10.1001/archpediatrics.2011.565; 10.1073/pnas.200033797; 10.1016/j.conb.2014.11.007; 10.1016/j.nbd.2012.03.012; 10.1001/archpedi.161.9.857; 10.1002/hbm.20403; 10.1016/S0028-3932(03)00090-3; 10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.003; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.1475; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.02.051; 10.1371/journal.pone.0018712; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.04.020; 10.1037/0894-4105.17.3.496; 10.1097/YCO.0000000000000178; 10.1016/S2215-0366(17)30049-4; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.09091379; 10.1371/journal.pone.0042486; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.04.057; 10.1016/j.cpr.2006.01.005; 10.1542/peds.2013-3433; 10.1111/desc.12096; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.3139; 10.1038/nrn2639; 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01598.x; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.10.012; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.08.016; 10.1080/15374416.2017.1326122; 10.1016/S0006-3223(02)01412-9; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2011.11020281; 10.1097/CHI.0b013e3181b395c0; 10.1017/S0954579405050376; 10.1037/a0018010; 10.1038/nn.3983; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2012.01147.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00600.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2005.00394.x; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1242-09.2009; 10.1016/j.jpeds.2008.06.002; 10.1176/appi.ajp.164.6.942; 10.3758/BRM.40.3.879; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08030426; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2004.10.007; 10.1017/S1355617710001335; 10.1037//1082-989X.7.2.147; 10.1016/j.jaac.2015.05.014; 10.1001/archpsyc.63.5.540; 10.1016/j.tics.2014.09.001; 10.1016/j.cobeha.2016.05.013; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00818.x; 10.1542/peds.2014-3482; 10.1002/brb3.531; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.06.011; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.03.072; 10.1017/S0305000912000177; 10.1177/0883073816678550",NA,"Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina."

The environmental factors, when represented by socio-economic status (SES) of the family, have been demonstrated to be related to the reading skills of a child. The neural correlates of the relation between SES and reading have been less thoroughly investigated. The present study expands current research by exploring the relation between SES, quantified by paternal educational level, reading of the offspring and the structure of white matter pathways in the left hemisphere as derived from DTI-based tractography analyses. Therefore, three dorsal white matter pathways, i.e. the long, anterior and posterior segments of the arcuate fasciculus (AF), and three ventral white matter pathways, i.e. the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and the uncinate fasciculus (UF), were manually dissected in the left hemisphere of 34 adolescents with a wide range of reading skills. The results demonstrated a relation between word reading, SES quantified by paternal educational level, and fractional anisotropy (FA) within the left dorsal AF segment and the left ventral UF. Thus, the present study proposes a relationship between paternal educational level and a specific white matter pathway that is important for reading, aiming to guide future research that can determine processes underlying this relationship.",2019,1,1,"PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0215560","PMC6497374","PLoS One","</AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Research School of Behavioural and Cognitive Neurosciences (BCN), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Maurits</LastName><ForeName>Natasha M</ForeName><Initials>NM</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Research School of Behavioural and Cognitive Neurosciences (BCN), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Maassen</LastName><ForeName>Ben A M</ForeName><Initials>BAM</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Center for Language and Cognition Groningen (CLCG), Faculty of Arts, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Research School of Behavioural and Cognitive Neurosciences (BCN), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng","D000293; D004410; D004522; D005260; D006801; D007091; D007807; D008279; D008297; D011932; D012307; D012923; D066127","Adolescent; Dyslexia; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Language Tests; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Reading; Risk Factors; Social Class; White Matter",NA,"10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.003; 10.1007/s10802-014-9858-9; 10.1002/rrq.160; 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2003.12.012; 10.1016/j.annepidem.2004.10.007; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00807.x; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00746.x; 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233; 10.1037/a0027238; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00600.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00542.x; 10.1097/01.wnr.0000223387.51704.89; 10.1016/j.cognition.2006.04.008; 10.1002/wcs.1383; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60198-6; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2012.04.002; 10.1002/hbm.22127; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.02.040; 10.1371/journal.pone.0012073; 10.1002/hbm.22749; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.05.008; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.06.037; 10.1038/ejhg.2011.160; 10.1016/j.tics.2006.04.003; 10.1002/hbm.24407; 10.1016/j.conb.2012.12.005; 10.1093/cercor/bhw095; 10.1016/j.dcn.2017.08.003; 10.1093/brain/awr363; 10.1371/journal.pone.0042486; 10.1111/desc.12428; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.01.021; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2004.03.011; 10.1093/scan/nsm013; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.10.015; 10.1016/j.conb.2007.03.006; 10.1002/dys.1463; 10.1348/026151010X485223; 10.1007/978-1-61737-992-5_6; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.018; 10.1016/j.cortex.2008.05.004; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.02.049; 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00346; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4383-12.2013; 10.1002/hbm.22848; 10.1007/s00429-016-1302-1; 10.1093/cercor/bhs383; 10.1016/j.dcn.2015.05.006; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.04.080; 10.1007/s00429-013-0666-8; 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.03.009; 10.1016/j.bandl.2018.05.007; 10.1073/pnas.1206792109; 10.1002/mrm.21965; 10.1097/WCO.0b013e328355d544; 10.3389/fnsys.2010.00150; 10.1089/brain.2013.0203; 10.1016/J.CUB.2017.10.034; 10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01147","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Center for Language and Cognition Groningen (CLCG), Faculty of Arts, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands."

Data on prehospital care were obtained from a local stroke register. Socioeconomic status was classified according to the average level of income and education within each patient's neighbourhood (postcode area). The median system delay from calling the emergency medical communication centre (EMCC) to start of brain computed tomography on hospital arrival was 3&#x2009;h 47&#x2009;min (95% confidence interval (CI) 3&#x2009;h 30&#x2009;min to 4&#x2009;h 05&#x2009;min) for patients within the lowest SES tertile and 3&#x2009;h 17&#x2009;min (95% CI 3&#x2009;h 00&#x2009;min to 3&#x2009;h 37&#x2009;min) for the highest tertile (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Patients with a lower SES were less likely to receive the highest priority in the ambulance (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) and had lower rates of prehospital recognition of stroke/TIA (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) than those with a high SES.

While the behavioral outcomes of growing up in such settings are well-known, the neural mechanisms underpinning poor outcomes have not been well elucidated, particularly in the context of low- and middle-income countries. In this study, we measure brain metabolic responses to social and nonsocial stimuli in a cohort of 6- and 36-month-old Bangladeshi children. Study participants in both cohorts lived in an urban slum and were exposed to a broad range of adversity early in life including extreme poverty, malnutrition, recurrent infections, and low maternal education. We observed brain regions that responded selectively to social stimuli in both ages indicating that these specialized brain responses are online from an early age. We additionally show that the magnitude of the socially selective response is related to maternal education, maternal stress, and the caregiving environment. Ultimately our results suggest that a variety of psychosocial hazards have a measurable relationship with the developing social brain.",2019,9,1,"Developmental science","10.1111/desc.12839","PMC6737924","Dev Sci","eng","D001459; D001921; D001931; D002675; D003071; D015331; D005260; D006801; D007223; D008297; D008606; D011203; D019265","Bangladesh; Brain; Brain Mapping; Child, Preschool; Cognition; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Mental Processes; Poverty; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared","G0400120; R03 HD091464; R01 AI043596; R01 HD018942; G0300025; G0701458","10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.05.012; 10.1192/bjp.bp.113.129486; 10.1016/j.tics.2015.07.002; 10.1117/1.nph.5.1.015004; 10.1214/aos/1013699998; 10.1111/ejn.13751; 10.1007/s10898-006-9035-y; 10.2307/2136404; 10.1093/cercor/bhv111; 10.3390/brainsci5010032; 10.1117/1.NPh.5.1.011006; 10.1088/0031-9155/40/2/007; 10.1063/1.2038567; 10.1364/BOE.1.000165; 10.1159/000438749; 10.1073/pnas.1121241109; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2010.01032.x; 10.1080/02646830701644896; 10.1037/bul0000002; 10.1111/desc.12246; 10.3329/jhpn.v28i1.4520; 10.1542/peds.2014-0694; 10.1364/ao.48.00d280; 10.1016/S2352-4642(17)30024-X; 10.1002/da.22147; 10.1353/cpr.2013.0046; 10.4269/ajtmh.14-0518; 10.1016/j.dcn.2016.11.005; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.07.008; 10.1098/rspb.2012.3026; 10.1162/jocn.2010.21598; 10.1080/17470919.2011.614696; 10.1111/ejn.13757; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2009.01312.x; 10.1038/srep04740; 10.1016/S0272-7358(98)00100-7; 10.1016/j.brainres.2014.10.051; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002034; 10.1016/j.dcn.2019.100638; 10.1088/0967-3334/33/2/259; 10.1111/jcpp.12000; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2012.01856.x; 10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.09.036; 10.1016/j.jecp.2011.12.002; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.01.018; 10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2014.11.005; 10.1111/jcpp.12413; 10.1017/s0033291714002955; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.01.021; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.04.055; 10.1002/wcs.12; 10.1002/dev.20579; 10.3368/jhr.50.2.446; 10.1111/mcn.12584; 10.1111/1467-8624.00570; 10.1093/cid/ciy310","The authors declare no conflicts of interest.","Labs of Cognitive Neuroscience, Division of Developmental Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."

However, poverty does not alter brain development directly, but acts through associated biological or psychosocial risk factors (e.g. malnutrition, family conflict). Yet few studies have investigated risk factors in the context of infant neurodevelopment, and none have done so in low-resource settings such as Bangladesh, where children are exposed to multiple, severe biological and psychosocial hazards. In this feasibility and pilot study, usable resting-state fMRI data were acquired in infants from extremely poor (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;16) and (relatively) more affluent (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;16) families in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) was estimated using bilateral seeds in the amygdala, where iFC has shown susceptibility to early life stress, and in sensory areas, which have exhibited less susceptibility to early life hazards. Biological and psychosocial risk factors were examined for associations with iFC. Three resting-state networks were identified in within-group brain maps: medial temporal/striatal, visual, and auditory networks. Infants from extremely poor families compared with those from more affluent families exhibited greater (i.e. less negative) iFC in precuneus for amygdala seeds; however, no group differences in iFC were observed for sensory area seeds. Height-for-age, a proxy for malnutrition/infection, was not associated with amygdala/precuneus iFC, whereas prenatal family conflict was positively correlated. Findings suggest that it is feasible to conduct infant fMRI studies in low-resource settings.

Given that these behaviors have been linked to adverse health outcomes among adolescents, this presents a new but rapidly growing challenge to human health in these under-resourced nations. However, very little is known about the associations between SB and fast food or soft drink consumption among adolescents in LMICs. Thus, data from the Global school-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) were cross-sectionally analyzed in 133,555 adolescents aged 12-15&#x2009;years from 44 LMICs [mean (SD) age 13.8 (1.0) years; 49% females]. The data were collected in the form of self-report questionnaires. Associations were assessed with multivariable logistic regression analysis and meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of fast food consumption (at least once in previous 7&#x2009;days) and carbonated soft drink consumption (at least once per day during past 30&#x2009;days) were 49.3 and 43.8%, respectively. The overall pooled estimates based on a meta-analysis with random effects for the association of &#x2265;3&#x2009;h/day of SB with fast food consumption and soft drink consumption using country-wise estimates were OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.35 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.27-1.43, I<sup>2</sup>&#xa0;=&#x2009;62.1%).) and OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.26 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.19-1.34; I<sup>2</sup>&#xa0;=&#x2009;54.3%), respectively.

Food insecurity is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon that is not appropriately captured by conventional proxy indicators currently used to assess the problem in developing countries. Ethiopia like many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, continues to experience high levels of drought driven food insecurity despite decades of implementing poverty alleviation and prevention programmes. These persistent droughts, combined with the devastating impact of climate change continue to threaten the livelihoods of thousands of men, women and children, who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. The overall objective of this study was to assess and analyze the drought driven food insecurity situation, malnutrition and derive policy implications in the Afar National Regional State of Ethiopia. Mixed methods designs which include both qualitative and quantitative were used. The subjects of the study were men and women dwellers, government officials and other stakeholders in Afar Regional State of Ethiopia. Four Hundred Twenty Two (422) eligible households were enrolled consecutively from randomly selected two Districts in Afar National Regional State of Ethiopia which were selected by stratified Randomized method. The Districts were randomly allocated into 3 Keble's from Amibara and 2 Keble's from Awash Fentale. Two FGD (total of 10 FGDs participants that mean each Districts = 5 FGD) and 10 KIIs from Amibara and Awash Fentale were conducted. Standard questionnaires were used for data collection after validating the instruments. The data was analyzed by using SPSS version 23. Associated factors and multiple logistic regressions were employed. The study significance was conducted by using &#x3b1; 5% level. In this research (58.1%) of the participants agreed that lower crop yield occurred due to heavy rains/floods were not shocks among households. While (41.9%) were shocks on households who travel further loyal for grazing was the highest level of shocks among all those listed.

Thus, the goal of this study was to investigate the association between consumption of carbonated soft drinks and suicide attempts among adolescents from 6 high-income, 22 middle-income and 4 low-income countries. Cross-sectional data from the Global school-based student health survey (GSHS) were analyzed. Data on past 12-month suicide attempts and past 30-day carbonated soft drink consumption (number of times per day) were collected. Multivariable logistic regression and meta-analysis were conducted to assess associations. There were 105,061 adolescents (49.0% females) aged 12-15 years included in the analysis. The overall prevalence of suicide attempts and consumption of carbonated soft drinks &#x2265;3 times/day were 10.2% and 10.7%, respectively. After adjustment for potential confounders (i.e., sex, age, food insecurity, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, obesity, fruit and vegetable consumption, fast food consumption, country), compared to those who did not consume carbonated soft drinks, those who consumed 3 and&#xa0;&#x2265;&#xa0;4 times/day were 1.36 (95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.07-1.72) and 1.43 (95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.14-1.80) times more likely to have reported an attempted suicide in the past 12 months, respectively.

"30985013","Capuchin monkeys (Sapajus [Cebus] apella) play Nash equilibria in dynamic games, but their decisions are likely not influenced by oxytocin.","Mackenzie F Smith, Kelly L Leverett, Bart J Wilson, Sarah F Brosnan","Comparative approaches to experimental economics have shed light on the evolution of social decision-making across a range of primate species, including humans. Here we replicate our previous work looking at six pairs of capuchin monkeys' (Sapajus [Cebus] apella) responses to scenarios requiring both coordination (Assurance Game) and anti-coordination (Hawk-Dove Game). This then provides a foundation for assessing their responses to two additional games, one with a scenario of beneficial cooperation with a temptation to defect (Prisoner's Dilemma) and one with an environment requiring changing strategies within short temporal proximity (Alternating Economic Game). We additionally explored the effects of exogenous oxytocin on decision-making. Oxytocin did not affect decisions in any of our games. Results from the first two games largely replicated our previous findings. Responses to the Prisoner's Dilemma were more varied than was seen in previous games, with pairs respectively cooperating, defecting, and failing to establish stable strategies. Such variability indicates that this game may be a good assay for individual differences in social decision-making. Finally, capuchins were able to flexibly switch between their previously established strategies within each of the different games, even when the games were presented within the same session, requiring strategy adjustments within short temporal proximity. These results build on earlier findings showing that capuchins can alter decision-making strategies as the context demands, which is likely essential for decision-making in naturally occurring contexts.",2019,4,1,"American journal of primatology","10.1002/ajp.22973",NA,"Am J Primatol","Language Research Center, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Leverett</LastName><ForeName>Kelly L</ForeName><Initials>KL</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Language Research Center, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Wilson</LastName><ForeName>Bart J</ForeName><Initials>BJ</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Economic Science Institute, Chapman University, Orange, California.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Smith Institute for Political Economy and Philosophy, Chapman University, Orange, California.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Brosnan</LastName><ForeName>Sarah F</ForeName><Initials>SF</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Psychology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Language Research Center, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Neuroscience Institute and Center for Behavioral Neuroscience, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Center for Behavioral Neuroscience, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng","D000818; D001522; D003657; D005260; D008297; D010121; D000068956; D012201; D000080522; D012919","Animals; Behavior, Animal; Decision Making; Female; Male; Oxytocin; Prisoner Dilemma; Reward; Sapajus apella; Social Behavior","SES 1123897","NA",NA,"Department of Psychology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia."

Data come from the 2014 Ontario Child Health Study-a provincially representative survey of 6537 families with 10,802 four- to 17-year-olds. Multivariate multilevel modelling was used to test if neighbourhood poverty and antisocial behaviour interact with household poverty to modify associations with children's externalizing and internalizing problems based on parent assessments of children (4- to 17-year-olds) and self-assessments of youth (12- to 17-year-olds). Based on parent assessments, neighbourhood poverty, and antisocial behaviour modified associations between household poverty and children's mental health problems. Among children living in households below the poverty line, levels of mental health problems were 1) lower when living in neighbourhoods with higher concentrations of poverty and 2) higher when living in neighbourhoods with more antisocial behaviour. These associations were stronger for externalizing versus internalizing problems when conditional on antisocial behaviour and generalized only to youth-assessed externalizing problems. The lower levels of externalizing problems reported among children living in poor households in low-income neighbourhoods identify potential challenges with integrating poorer households into more affluent neighbourhoods. More important, children living in poor households located in neighbourhoods exhibiting more antisocial behaviour are at dramatically higher risk for mental health problems. Reducing levels of neighbourhood antisocial behaviour could have large mental health benefits, particularly among poor children.

The 1983 ( n = 2836) and 2014 ( n = 5785) Ontario Child Health Studies are provincially representative cross-sectional surveys with identical self-report checklist measures of conduct disorder, hyperactivity, and emotional disorder, as well as perceived need for professional help, assessed by integrating parent and teacher responses (ages 4 to 11) and parent and youth responses (ages 12 to 16). The overall prevalence of perceived need for professional help increased from 6.8% to 18.9% among 4- to 16-year-olds. An increase in any disorder among children (15.4% to 19.6%) was attributable to increases in hyperactivity among males (8.9% to 15.7%). Although the prevalence of any disorder did not change among youth, conduct disorder decreased (7.2% to 2.5%) while emotional disorder increased (9.2% to 13.2%). The prevalence of any disorder increased more in rural and small to medium urban areas versus large urban areas. The prevalence of any disorder decreased for children and youth in immigrant but not nonimmigrant families. Although there have been decreases in the prevalence of conduct disorder, increases in other mental disorders and perceived need for professional help underscore the continued need for effective prevention and intervention programs.

Understanding what promotes resilient outcomes is essential for the development of evidence informed intervention strategies. We conducted a systematic review to identify how child resilience is measured and what factors are associated with resilient outcomes. Systematic search conducted in CINAHL, MEDLINE and PsychInfo from January 2004 to October 2018 using the keywords 'resilien* and child* in the title or abstract. Eligible studies: (1) described children aged 5-12 years; (2) identified exposure to social adversity; (3) identified resilience; and (4) investigated factors associated with resilience. (1) approaches to identifying resilience and (2) factors associated with resilient outcomes. From 1979 studies retrieved, 30 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were moderate to high quality, with low cultural competency. Social adversity exposures included poverty, parent loss, maltreatment and war. Only two studies used a measure of child resilience; neither was psychometrically validated. Remaining studies classified children as resilient if they showed positive outcomes (eg, mental health or academic achievement) despite adversity. A range of child, family, school and community factors were associated with resilient outcomes, with individual factors most commonly investigated. The best available evidence was for cognitive skills, emotion regulation, relationships with caregivers and academic engagement. While there is huge variation in the type and severity of adversity that children experience, there is some evidence that specific individual, relational and school factors are associated with resilient outcomes across a range of contexts. Such factors provide an important starting point for effective public health interventions to promote resilience and to prevent or ameliorate the immediate and long-term impacts of social adversity on children.",2019,4,11,"BMJ open","10.1136/bmjopen-2018-024870","PMC6500354","BMJ Open","eng","D000069586; D006302; D006801; D008603; D055500; D012307; D064890; D012931","Adult Survivors of Child Adverse Events; Health Services Research; Humans; Mental Health; Resilience, Psychological; Risk Factors; Social Determinants of Health; Social Environment",NA,"10.1007/s00737-016-0659-8; 10.1503/cmaj.131792; 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69523-8; 10.1111/birt.12123; 10.1186/s12884-016-0867-2; 10.5694/mja12.11716; 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)74234-3; 10.1192/apt.10.3.216; 10.1111/j.1365-2214.2010.01150.x; 10.1016/j.cpr.2004.02.002; 10.1037/0022-006X.71.2.339; 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2008.01752.x; 10.1192/bjp.180.6.502; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2014.03.008; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2008.12.009; 10.1016/S2468-2667(17)30094-4; 10.1007/s10896-012-9474-9; 10.1016/S2468-2667(17)30118-4; 10.1207/s15374424jccp2304_6; 10.1001/jama.290.15.2063; 10.1023/B:PREV.0000045355.53137.45; 10.1017/S0954579411000198; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2012.02608.x; 10.1111/1467-8624.00164; 10.1177/070674371105600504; 10.1017/S095457941200003X; 10.1111/j.1939-0025.2010.01060.x; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02216.x; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2017.05.014; 10.1002/car.2258; 10.1016/j.jsp.2012.04.004; 10.1136/jech-2015-206980; 10.1186/1752-1505-8-13; 10.1016/j.jaac.2017.07.780; 10.1542/peds.2009-1100D; 10.1111/cdev.12736; 10.1016/S2468-2667(17)30139-1; 10.1111/cdoe.12058; 10.1111/j.1475-6773.2012.01410.x; 10.1111/bjdp.12028; 10.1371/journal.pone.0065041; 10.1023/A:1023056425648; 10.1016/j.pedn.2004.02.004; 10.1196/annals.1376.041; 10.1111/jcpp.12622; 10.1111/ajop.12027; 10.1017/S0954579407000399; 10.1037/0012-1649.41.2.338; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2009.01.002; 10.1207/s15374424jccp3304_3; 10.1007/s10802-013-9848-3; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2006.03.011; 10.1086/499748; 10.1093/swr/32.1.6; 10.3109/01460862.2012.678261; 10.1007/s10826-017-0904-4; 10.1111/j.1468-2397.2009.00654.x; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2011.05.009; 10.2989/16085906.2015.1052822; 10.1111/mono.12017; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2013.07.005; 10.1017/S0954579413000151; 10.1177/1524838009358892; 10.1186/1477-7525-9-8; 10.1186/s13643-017-0644-y; 10.1186/1471-2458-14-201; 10.1007/s00787-018-1115-2; 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017858; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.07.013; 10.1016/j.acap.2015.12.005","Competing interests: None declared.","Intergenerational Health, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."

Hence, malnutrition has been persisted at alarming raters in the country. Moreover, it is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Afar National Regional State of Ethiopia. Specifically, in Amibara and Awash Fentale districts. The anthropometric data were presented on height, weight, MUAC, weight/height/Age and Body Mass Index (BMI) of under-five children. A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted from March 01, 2017 to June 15, 2018. The data was collected by using anthropometric measurement. A multi stage random sampling procedure was applied in order to recruit the required sample size. The data collections were conducted at two selected districts in Afar region by trained interviewers and health care providers. The data were analyzed by using SPSS Version 23. Bivariate analysis between dependent and independent variables was employed. Multivariate analysis was also done to control for possible confounding variable by selecting variable which show statistically significant association (P&lt; 0.05). Out of 410 under five children's anthropometric finding, the majorities (62.7%) of those registered under five children were male and (33.3%) were female. The majority (46.8%) of under five children were less than or equal to 50&#xa0;cm by their height. Most (54.1%) of under five children were less than or equal to 12.5&#xa0;cm by their MUAC. It indicated that they were diagnosed with severe malnutrition based on anthropometric measurements. Meanwhile, majority (64%) of under five children were less than 60% their weight/age. Regression analysis result indicated that all of the variables were not significant predictors of BMI for under five children (P&gt; 0.05). Based on ANOVA result, there was significant difference between sex and other predictors (P= 0.031). This finding implies that improvement in food aid and poverty alleviation programs are very important. Based on the finding, it is important to provide high quality and quantity of food. Moreover, less access to assets and health services commonly contributed for malnutrition. Highlighting under five children's malnutrition will help to develop and design future policies and programs in Ethiopia.",2019,1,1,"Human antibodies","10.3233/HAB-190371",NA,"Hum Antibodies","eng","D000367; D000886; D001827; D015992; D001835; D002675; D003430; D005002; D005260; D006130; D006801; D007223; D007231; D008297; D044342; D015995; D012737; D013851","Age Factors; Anthropometry; Body Height; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethiopia; Female; Growth Disorders; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Malnutrition; Prevalence; Sex Factors; Thinness",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Health in Emergencies and Disasters, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."
"30954786","Association between socioeconomic status, belonging to an ethnic minority and obstructive sleep apnea: a systematic review of the literature.","Ottavia Guglielmi, Paola Lanteri, Sergio Garbarino","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder associated with obesity, hypertension and metabolic syndrome. People with low socioeconomic status (SES) who are socially disadvantaged (eg, people belonging to an ethnic minority) have worse health outcomes. Thus, consequently, social inequality may potentially be a risk factor for OSA. This systematic review aims to summarize previous studies from the literature which investigate the association between SES, race/ethnicity and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA statement. A literature search in Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted. Articles published in English, Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese, without publication date limits, and that aimed to analyze the association between OSA diagnosis and social disadvantage, were selected. In sum, 17 articles met the inclusion criteria. One was a longitudinal study, and the remainder were cross-sectional research. Low SES was indicated as a risk factor for the presence of OSA in most of the articles. Concerning racial/ethnic groups, a clear association with OSA does not emerge, since, in a few articles, the relation disappeared after controlling for variables such as obesity, comorbidities, and SES; suggesting that there may be differences only in OSA severity and sleep apnea phenotypes.

"30954479","Variations in patterns of involuntary hospitalisation and in legal frameworks: an international comparative study.","Luke Sheridan Rains, Tatiana Zenina, Marisa Casanova Dias, Rebecca Jones, Stephen Jeffreys, Stella Branthonne-Foster, Brynmor Lloyd-Evans, Sonia Johnson","Rising annual incidence of involuntary hospitalisation have been reported in England and some other higher-income countries, but the reasons for this increase are unclear. We aimed to describe the extent of variations in involuntary annual hospitalisation rates between countries, to compare trends over time, and to explore whether variations in legislation, demographics, economics, and health-care provision might be associated with variations in involuntary hospitalisation rates. We compared annual incidence of involuntary hospitalisation between 2008 and 2017 (where available) for 22 countries across Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. We also obtained data on national legislation, demographic and economic factors (gross domestic product [GDP] per capita, prevalence of inequality and poverty, and the percentage of populations who are foreign born, members of ethnic minorities, or living in urban settings), and service characteristics (health-care spending and provision of psychiatric beds and mental health staff). Annual incidence data were obtained from government sources or published peer-reviewed literature. The median rate of involuntary hospitalisation was 106&#xb7;4 (IQR 58&#xb7;5 to 150&#xb7;9) per 100&#x2008;000 people, with Austria having the highest (282 per 100&#x2008;000 individuals) and Italy the lowest (14&#xb7;5 per 100&#x2008;000 individuals) most recently available rates. We observed no relationship between annual involuntary hospitalisation rates and any characteristics of the legal framework. Higher national rates of involuntary hospitalisation were associated with a larger number of beds (&#x3b2; coefficient 0&#xb7;65, 95% CI 0&#xb7;10 to 1&#xb7;20, p=0&#xb7;021), higher GDP per capita purchasing power parity (&#x3b2; coefficient 1&#xb7;84, 0&#xb7;30 to 3&#xb7;38, p=0&#xb7;019), health-care spending per capita (&#x3b2; coefficient 15&#xb7;92, 3&#xb7;34 to 28&#xb7;49, p=0&#xb7;013), the proportion of foreign-born individuals in the population (&#x3b2; coefficient 7&#xb7;32, 0&#xb7;44 to 14&#xb7;19, p=0&#xb7;037), and lower absolute poverty (&#x3b2; coefficient -11&#xb7;5, -22&#xb7;6 to -0&#xb7;3, p=0&#xb7;044). There was no evidence of an association between annual involuntary hospitalisation incidence and any other demographic, economic, or health-care indicator. Variations between countries were large and for the most part unexplained. We found a higher annual incidence of involuntary hospitalisation to be associated with a lower rate of absolute poverty, with higher GDP and health-care spending per capita, a higher proportion of foreign-born individuals in a population, and larger numbers of inpatient beds, but limitations in ecological research must be noted, and the associations were weak. Other country-level demographic, economic, and health-care delivery indicators and characteristics of the legislative system appeared to be unrelated to annual involuntary hospitalisation rates. Understanding why involuntary hospitalisation rates vary so much could be advanced through a more fine-grained analysis of the relationships between involuntary hospitalisation and social context, clinical practice, and how legislation is implemented in practice.

There is a paucity of research into acceptability of PADs in Indian mental health care, likely due to a lack of awareness. There are no educational measures about PADs provided for in this Act. Facilitators and facilitation methods have not been elaborated upon as well. The aim of this study is (a) to develop/evaluate the effectiveness of a structured Education-cum-Assessment Tool (EAT) in providing information regarding PADs and (b) to evaluate modes of facilitation required by patients to complete PADs. A tool was developed as per provisions regarding PADs in the Mental Health Care Bill of 2013. This tool was administered to patients ( n&#x2009;=&#x2009;100), purposively sampled from the adult psychiatry review out-patient department (OPD). Patients were evaluated on retention of information, completion of PADs, modes of facilitation and time taken to write one. Mean years of education was 8.28 (&#xb1;5.74) years and mean duration of illness was 8.30 (&#xb1;7.04) years. In all, 65% had Below-Poverty Line (BPL) status. All participants completed valid PADs in an average of 15&#x2009;minutes. About 93% required facilitation via assistance in writing and reminding. The mean EAT scores implied above 70% retention but did not relate to types of facilitation. EAT scores can be used as an approximate measure of the patient's ability to understand and retain information which is a part of decisional capacity. Types of facilitation can help in understanding patient's ability to communicate their choices.

The constellation of complex, co-occurring biological, environmental, social, economic and psychological risk factors are in turn transmitted to her child, conferring vulnerability for adverse development. This study examines the association between maternal intra- and extra-familial ACEs, maternal education and the mental health of her child, mediated by maternal mental health. Mother-child dyads (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;121) in Machakos, Kenya were examined cross-sectionally using self-report measures of ACEs, maternal mental health and child internalizing and externalizing mental health problems. The four models proposed to examine the relationship between intra- and extra-familial maternal ACEs and child internalizing and externalizing problems demonstrated indirect pathways through maternal mental health. These effects were found to be conditional on levels of maternal education, which served as a protective factor at lower levels of maternal ACEs. These models demonstrate how the impact of ACEs persists across the lifespan resulting in a negative impact on maternal mental health and conferring further risk to subsequent generations. Elucidating the association between ACEs and subsequent intergenerational sequelae, especially in LMIC where risk is heightened, may improve targeted caregiver mental health programs for prevention and intervention.",2019,9,1,"Developmental science","10.1111/desc.12833",NA,"Dev Sci","eng","D000328; D000076783; D002648; D003430; D005260; D006801; D007630; D008297; D001523; D008603; D009035; D011203; D012307; D013315","Adult; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Kenya; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Mothers; Poverty; Risk Factors; Stress, Psychological",NA,"NA",NA,"Neuroscience Graduate Program, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada."

Primary outcomes were stigmatising attitudes and discriminatory behaviours. Data collection included two strategies. First, previous systematic reviews were searched for studies that met the inclusion criteria of the current review. Second, a new search was done, covering the time since the previous reviews, i.e. January 2013 to May 2017. Five search concepts were combined in order to capture relevant literature: stigma, mental health, intervention, professional students in medicine and nursing, and LMICs. A qualitative analysis of all included full texts was done with the software MAXQDA. Full texts were analysed with regard to the content of interventions, didactic methods, mental disorders, cultural adaptation, type of outcome measure and primary outcomes. Furthermore, a methodological quality assessment was undertaken. A total of nine studies from six countries (Brazil, China, Malaysia, Nigeria, Somaliland and Turkey) were included. All studies reported significant results in at least one outcome measure. However, from the available literature, it is difficult to draw conclusions on the most effective interventions. No meta-analysis could be calculated due to the large heterogeneity of intervention content, evaluation design and outcome measures. Studies with contact interventions (either face-to-face or video) demonstrated attitudinal change. There was a clear lack of studies focusing on discriminatory behaviours. Accordingly, training of specific communication and clinical skills was lacking in most studies, with the exception of one study that showed a positive effect of training interview skills on attitudes. Methods for cultural adaptation of interventions were rarely documented. The methodological quality of most studies was relatively low, with the exception of two studies. There is an increase in studies on anti-stigma interventions among professional students in LMICs. Some of these studies used contact interventions and showed positive effects.

A total of 33,421 participants aged&#xa0;&#x2265;&#xa0;50 years were included. A set of diagnostic questions from the World Mental Health Survey was used within SAGE to define depression. The crude population prevalence of depression was 7.4% [95%CI: 6.5%-8.3%] ranging from 1.5% in China to 15.2% in India. It was higher in females 8.6% [7.6%-9.6%] compared to males 6.1% [5.0%-7.2%].

In addition, they use what I term 'plasticity talk', a form of anti-determinist discourse, to put forth what they believe is a hopeful conception of body and brain as fundamentally malleable. They draw attention to their explicit intentions to use scientific inquiry to mitigate inequality and further social justice - in fact, they believe their studies are powerful evidence that add to the literature on the social determinants of health. Though they may be interested in improving lives, they argue that their aims and means have little in common with programs trying to 'improve' the genetic stock of the population.

The Knee Self Efficacy Scale (K-SES) available in Swedish and English, was developed to measure self-efficacy in present (K-SES<sub>present</sub>) and future (K-SES<sub>future</sub>) functioning. The objective of this study was to determine measurement properties of the K-SES in Dutch patients. The K-SES was translated and structural validity, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and measurement error were assessed in three patient samples: one group completed the questionnaire and additional measures pre-surgery (<i>N</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;200), and one group post-surgery (<i>N</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;58).

"30893361","Relationship among school socioeconomic status, teacher-student relationship, and middle school students' academic achievement in China: Using the multilevel mediation model.","Xin Xuan, Ye Xue, Cai Zhang, Yuhan Luo, Wen Jiang, Mengdi Qi, Yun Wang","School socioeconomic status (SES) is studied primarily as a variable to explain academic achievement; however, few previous studies have investigated how SES can influence individual student's academic achievement. The present study used a national representative sample of 10,784 grade 7 to 9 students (53.2% boys and 46.8% girls) in mainland China to examine the links between school SES and students' math and Chinese achievements, including the math and Chinese teacher-student relationships as mediating factors. The parents provided family socioeconomic information and the students reported on their teacher-student relationships. Achievements in math and Chinese were assessed using standardized tests. Multilevel mediation analyses revealed that school SES was positively related to students' math and Chinese achievements. Moreover, the link between school SES and students' math achievement was partially mediated by students' perception of the math teacher-student relationship. The Chinese teacher-student relationship had no mediating effect. This study indicated that school SES can influence individual student's academic achievement via their perception of teacher-student relationship. The poverty and lack of resources is obvious, yet low SES schools could make efforts in improving teacher-student relationship's quality to promote students' academic performance. Meanwhile, low SES schools should receive more attention from policymakers to improve teaching quality and school climate. Furthermore, the study findings could be used for future research on the gap between low and high SES schools.",2019,1,1,"PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0213783","PMC6426256","PLoS One","eng","D000076363; D000293; D002681; D005260; D006801; D007398; D008962; D012923","Academic Success; Adolescent; China; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Models, Theoretical; Social Class",NA,"10.1111/desc.12246; 10.1126/science.1165821; 10.1080/14616734.2012.672260; 10.1037/a0027916; 10.1016/j.jsp.2010.05.001; 10.1093/heapol/czl029; 10.1037/a0018053; 10.1111/josh.12364; 10.1037/a0026339; 10.1177/000312240907400502","ShuangLiu International Airport is the employer of Weng Jiang (author).

"30890043","Tedium vitae in stroke survivors: a comparative cross-sectional study.","Akin Ojagbemi, Toyin Bello","Suicide is best studied by deconstructing the psychological experiences preceding suicidal death. We assessed the characteristics of tedium vitae (feeling tired of life) after first ever stroke in Nigerian survivors. Using the Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry, tedium vitae was assessed in 130 stroke survivors attending rehabilitation in a large Nigerian university hospital. Global cognitive and executive dysfunctions were evaluated, respectively, using the Mini Mental State Examination and the modi&#xfb01;ed Indiana University Token test. All participants had their index stroke 3 to 24 months before recruitment into the study. We also examined a comparative group of 130 age, gender, and education matched apparently normal persons who were unrelated to the stroke survivors. Associations were explored using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Tedium vitae was experienced by 16 (12.3%) stroke survivors compared with 5 (3.9%) in the comparative group (O. R = 3.5, 95% C. I = 1.3-9.9, p = 0.018). Among stroke survivors, those who were retired were more likely to experience tedium vitae (56.2%, p = 0.045). In analyses adjusting for the effect of systemic hypertension, cognitive dysfunction, retirement and marital separation, there was a 3.5-fold increase in the odds of experiencing tedium vitae after surviving a stroke (O. R = 3.5, 95% C. I = 1.1-11.6, p = 0.042). Tedium vitae is a common suicidal experience after stroke and may be among the earliest perceptible pointer to impending poststroke suicide.

"30888262","Gender-specific predictors of methadone treatment outcomes among African Americans at an urban clinic.","Jamey J Lister, Suzanne Brown, Mark K Greenwald, David M Ledgerwood","<i>Background:</i> African American patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) have demonstrated poorer methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) outcomes compared with white patients. This issue is further complicated in urban settings, where African Americans experience high rates of poverty and publicly funded treatment. Despite interrelated factors that disadvantage African Americans, the literature focusing on this population is scant. To address this shortcoming, we conducted the first investigation of gender differences and gender-specific MMT outcome predictors among African Americans (or any racial minority population). This study provides gender-specific findings to improve African American MMT outcomes. <i>Methods:</i> We studied 211 African American patients (male: <i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;137, 64.9%) at an urban, university-affiliated MMT clinic. We used existing intake data to assess baseline demographic, substance use, mental health, and interpersonal factors. Primary outcomes were 3-month drug<sup>+</sup> (positive) urine drug screen (UDS) results and treatment retention. <i>Results:</i> Women were more likely (than men) to endorse histories of interpersonal violence, substance abuse in their social network, and mental health problems. Men reported a greater likelihood (than women) for early opioid-use onset and a lack of prior MMT. There were no gender differences in 3-month drug<sup>+</sup> UDS or treatment retention. In multivariable analyses among women, no baseline factors predicted 3-month opioid<sup>+</sup> UDS and physical abuse history predicted a higher proportion of 3-month cocaine<sup>+</sup> UDS. Among men, primary injection opioid use and older age best predicted a higher proportion of 3-month cocaine<sup>+</sup> UDS and parent substance abuse predicted shorter retention. In both gender-stratified analyses, higher proportions of 3-month opioid<sup>+</sup> UDS and cocaine<sup>+</sup> UDS predicted shorter retention. <i>Conclusions:</i> This study offers an analysis of gender differences in risk factors, MMT outcomes, and gender-specific predictors among African American patients.

Epidemiological studies indicate that these alcohol consumption measures are differentially associated with (mental) health outcomes and socioeconomic status (SES). The current study aims to elucidate to what extent genetic risk factors are shared between frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption, and how these alcohol consumption measures are genetically associated with four broad phenotypic categories: (i) SES; (ii) substance use disorders; (iii) other psychiatric disorders; and (iv) psychological/personality traits. Genome-Wide Association analyses were conducted to test genetic associations with alcohol consumption frequency (N = 438 308) and alcohol consumption quantity (N = 307 098 regular alcohol drinkers) within UK Biobank. For the other phenotypes, we used genome-wide association studies summary statistics. Genetic correlations (rg) between the alcohol measures and other phenotypes were estimated using LD score regression. We found a substantial genetic correlation between the frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption (rg = 0.52). Nevertheless, both measures consistently showed opposite genetic correlations with SES traits, and many substance use, psychiatric, and psychological/personality traits. High alcohol consumption frequency was genetically associated with high SES and low risk of substance use disorders and other psychiatric disorders, whereas the opposite applies for high alcohol consumption quantity. Although the frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption show substantial genetic overlap, they consistently show opposite patterns of genetic associations with SES-related phenotypes. Future studies should carefully consider the potential influence of SES on the shared genetic etiology between alcohol and adverse (mental) health outcomes.",2020,2,1,"Psychological medicine","10.1017/S0033291719000357","PMC7083578","Psychol Med","eng","D000328; D000368; D000428; D000437; D018070; D005260; D055106; D006801; D008297; D008603; D008875; D012923; D019966; D006113","Adult; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholism; Biological Specimen Banks; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Social Class; Substance-Related Disorders; United Kingdom","U01 MH109532; U10 AA008401","NA",NA,"Department of Psychiatry, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam Neuroscience, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."

Despite recent advances on characterizing brain structural variance associated with SES during development, how it influences brain's functional organization remains elusive. Associations between SES, an fMRI feature of regional spontaneous activity (fractional amplitude of low frequencies fluctuation, fALFF), and behavioral/emotional problems were investigated in a school-based sample of 655 Brazilian children. A voxel-by-voxel approach was applied in order to map brain regions where fALFF was correlated with SES. Based on compelling previous evidence, we hypothesized that fALFF should be associated with SES in areas involved in language processing or cognitive control. Further, we tested if the spontaneous activity in these mapped areas would also correlated with general, internalizing and externalizing problems. SES of children was found to be positively correlated with spontaneous activity in right superior temporal gyrus. In the exploratory analysis, the fALFF of this area was negatively correlated with the expression of internalizing problems. Extending previous behavioral and structural neuroimaging findings, we report an association between SES and the spontaneous activity of a brain area enrolled in the extended language network.

We developed an interactive health check questionnaire facilitated by trained lay advisors. It entails 29 questions about background, lifestyle and health with tailored behaviour change advice. Personalised results are printed using a traffic light (red/amber/green) system, highlighting areas where action should be taken. This is an individually randomised control trial to test effectiveness of the health check on symptom recognition. A total 246 participants aged 40+ years will be recruited from community and healthcare settings in socioeconomically deprived areas of Yorkshire and South Wales. Participants will be randomised to receive the health check or standard care (1:1 ratio). Outcome measures include: adapted Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer (primary outcome), brief State Trait Anxiety Inventory, intentions and motivation to adopt recommended health behaviours (early symptom presentation, cancer screening and lifestyle behaviours), adapted Client Service Receipt Inventory, brief medical history/screening and demographic questionnaire at: baseline; 2-weeks; and 6-months post-randomisation. A purposive sample of intervention sessions will be audio-recorded (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;24) and half will additionally be observed (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;12). Semi-structured interviews will take place at 2-weeks (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;30) and 6-months (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;15-20) post-randomisation. The primary analysis will compare cancer symptom recognition scores between arms at 2-weeks. Secondary analysis will assess cancer beliefs, barriers/time to presentation, screening and lifestyle behaviours, anxiety and costs. A process evaluation will assess intervention fidelity, dose and contamination. The London-Surrey NHS Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 17/LO/1507) approved this trial. This is a trial of a theoretically underpinned complex intervention which has undergone phase 1 and 2 development work. The findings will evaluate evidence about the effect of the health check on symptom awareness. Although there are few exclusion criteria there are limitations regarding the population we are able to reach, who may have even higher risks of late diagnosis and poor cancer prognosis. However, the health check has the potential to improve cancer symptom awareness and encourage early help-seeking behaviour in deprived populations, thereby reducing inequalities in longer term cancer outcomes.

Three waves of data provided by 6,343 participants (49% men) were analyzed from a representative community-based sample from Canberra, Australia (2003-2015). The outcome was a composite measure reflecting fluid cognitive abilities. Financial hardship was assessed by markers of scarcity (being unable to heat the home, missing meals, and going without other basic needs) and behavioral responses to hardship (pawning items and seeking help from community welfare organizations). Multivariable-adjusted fixed-effect regression models for panel data with robust standard errors tested time-dependent associations between measures of financial hardship and fluid cognitive abilities. Declines in cognitive performance coincided with the experience of scarcity (&#x3b2; = -0.07; standard error, 0.018). There was no association between behavioral responses to hardship and cognitive performance, and there was no difference in the associations across age cohorts or by sex.

Analyses also accounted for the influence of caregiver depression, family relationship quality, and sociodemographic factors (race, income) on the relationship between behaviors and intervention engagement. Analyses were based on 118 children participating in the Coping Power intervention. Composite variables were created to represent externalizing behaviors and intervention engagement constructs. Associations between these composite variables were examined over 24 treatment sessions. Findings indicated a regressive relationship among externalizing behaviors, i.e., baseline externalizing behaviors were positively associated with immediate follow-up behaviors. There were also dynamic relationships observed among engagement constructs. Notably, engagement with in-session activities during sessions 1-8 was positively associated with out-of-session activity engagement during the same treatment time period. Engagement with out-of-session activities during sessions 1-8 was positively associated with in-session activity engagement during sessions 9-16, indicating a complete mediation between early and middle in-session engagement through the mechanism of early out-of-session engagement. A crosslag relationship was observed: middle in-session engagement was negatively associated with externalizing behaviors at immediate follow-up. Finally, an interaction of race by income on immediate follow-up externalizing behaviors was observed, such that Black children's externalizing behaviors remain static regardless of income level while White children's behaviors decreased with higher income.

Pooling data across 4 cohort studies, 814 cognitively normal participants (mean baseline age = 59.6 years) were classified into 8 ATN groups using baseline CSF levels of &#x3b2;-amyloid 1-42 as a measure of amyloid (A), phosphorylated tau 181 as a measure of tau (T), and total tau as a measure of neurodegeneration (N). Cognitive performance was measured using a previously validated global factor score and with the Mini-Mental State Examination. We compared the cognitive trajectories across groups using growth curve models (mean follow-up time = 7 years). Using different model formulations and cut points for determining biomarker abnormality, only the group with abnormal levels of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration (A+T+N+) showed consistently greater cognitive decline than the group with normal levels of all biomarkers (A-T-N-). Replicating prior findings using the 2011 National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association/suspected non-Alzheimer disease pathophysiology schema, only individuals with abnormal levels of both amyloid and phosphorylated tau 181 or total tau (stage 2) showed greater cognitive decline than those with normal biomarker levels (stage 0).

Predictors of trajectories and the association of trajectories with child outcomes were assessed. This is a secondary analysis of data collected among women living in Cape Town settlements (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;446). Participants were eligible if pregnant and 18&#xa0;years or older, and included in the analysis if allocated to the control arm (routine perinatal care). Participants were excluded in case of non-singleton birth and baby death. Follow-up assessments were at 2&#xa0;weeks, 6-, 18-, and 36-month postpartum. Trajectories of depressive symptoms were based on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores until 18-month postpartum, using latent class growth analysis. Child physical, cognitive, socio-emotional, and behavioural outcomes were assessed at 18 and/or 36&#xa0;months. Univariate and multivariate regressions were used to identify predictors of trajectories and differences in child outcomes. Four trajectories were identified: chronic low (71.1%), late postpartum (10.1%), early postpartum (14.4%), and chronic high (4.5%). Low social support, unwanted pregnancy, and risky drinking were associated with the chronic high trajectory; unemployment and HIV-positive status with the early postpartum trajectory; and intimate partner violence with the late postpartum trajectory. Weight-to-length and weight-for-age z-scores at 18&#xa0;months, and weight-for-age z-scores, length-for-age z-scores, emotional symptom, and peer problem scores at 36&#xa0;months differed across trajectories.

Poverty is robustly linked to adolescents' mental health problems; however, less is known about how perceptions of their social status and exposure to local area income inequality relate to mental health. Participants consisted of a population-representative sample of over 2,100 adolescents (ages 10-16), 395 of whom completed a 14-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study. Participants' subjective social status (SSS) was assessed at the start of the EMA, and mental health symptoms were measured both at baseline for the entire sample and daily in the EMA sample. Adolescents' SSS tracked family, school, and neighborhood economic indicators (|r| ranging from .12 to .30), and associations did not differ by age, race, or gender. SSS was independently associated with mental health, with stronger associations among older (ages 14-16) versus younger (ages 10-13) adolescents. Adolescents with lower SSS reported higher psychological distress and inattention problems, as well as more conduct problems, in daily life. Those living in areas with higher income inequality reported significantly lower subjective social status, but this association was explained by family and neighborhood income. Findings illustrate that adolescents' SSS is correlated with both internalizing and externalizing mental health problems, and that by age 14 it becomes a unique predictor of mental health problems.

Health administrative and MS clinical data were linked for 2 cohorts of patients with MS in British Columbia (Canada) and South East Wales (UK). SES was measured at MS symptom onset (&#xb1;3 years) based on neighborhood-level average income. The association between SES at MS onset and sustained and confirmed Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 6.0 and 4.0 and onset of secondary progression of MS (SPMS) were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. EDSS scores were also examined via linear regression, using generalized estimating equations (GEE) with an exchangeable working correlation. Models were adjusted for onset age, sex, initial disease course, and disease-modifying drug exposure. Random effect models (meta-analysis) were used to combine results from the 2 cohorts. A total of 3,113 patients with MS were included (2,069 from Canada; 1,044 from Wales). A higher SES was associated with a lower hazard of reaching EDSS 6.0 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89-0.91), EDSS 4.0 (aHR 0.93, 0.88-0.98), and SPMS (aHR 0.94, 0.88-0.99). The direction of findings was similar when all EDSS scores were included (GEE: &#x3b2; = -0.13, -0.18 to -0.08).

Antisocial behaviour is a heterogeneous concept which includes diverse behaviours such as physical fighting, vandalism, lying, disobedience and irritability. It remains unclear whether the mechanisms underlying social inequalities are similar across these different subtypes of antisocial behaviour. This study aimed to simultaneously test a range of individual, family and neighbourhood factors as mediators of the relationship between income and subtypes of antisocial behaviour. Data on a UK representative sample of 7977 children and adolescents, aged 5-16, was analysed in a series of nested structural equation models. A range of antisocial outcomes, including irritability, aggression, and callous-unemotional traits, were measured. Income quintiles were used to indicate family socioeconomic status. A range of potentially mediating or confounding variables, such as family functioning and parental mental health, were also measured. Analyses revealed that unhealthy family functioning, neighbourhood disadvantage, stressful life events and children's literacy difficulties were mediating variables contributing to the indirect effect of income on a range of antisocial behaviours. As expected family functioning accounted for a substantial proportion of the association between SES and antisocial behaviour, we also found evidence that child cognitive functioning might perform an important role.

Yet the pathways by which these factors influence disability remain unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate a model examining socioeconomic status (SES), perceived stress, and depressive symptoms as determinants of lupus-related disability.<b>Methods:</b> The sample included 134 patients receiving treatment at an academic hospital. Structural equation modeling examined the direct and indirect effects of SES (income, education, and subjective social status), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), and depressive symptoms (Hospital Depression Anxiety Scale depression subscale) on disability (Lupus Patient-Reported Outcome measure Physical Health and Pain-Vitality subscales).<b>Results:</b> Structural equation modeling confirmed that the model fit the data well. The SES exerted a direct negative effect on perceived stress (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.40, <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). In turn, perceived stress predicted higher levels of depression (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.72, <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), which ultimately contributed to greater disability (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.53, <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The influence of SES on disability was indirect (mediated by perceived stress and depression).<b>Conclusions:</b> Findings support the socioeconomic gradient in disability as mediated by perceived stress and depression, such that lower SES contributed to lupus-related disability via perceived stress and depressive symptoms.Implications for RehabilitationLow socioeconomic status, perceived stress, and depression are prognostic factors for the disability in systemic lupus erythematosus.Study findings indicate that perceived stress and depression fully mediate (account for) the negative impact of low socioeconomic status on lupus-related disability.Screening for and addressing psychological distress may enhance management of disability in lupus patients.This research demonstrates the value of a conceptual framework for identifying potentially modifiable risk factors for disability in lupus and other chronic disabling diseases.",2020,5,1,"Disability and rehabilitation","10.1080/09638288.2018.1522550",NA,"Disabil Rehabil","eng","D000328; D003863; D006233; D004522; D005260; D006801; D007182; D008180; D008297; D008875; D000079225; D012923; D013315","Adult; Depression; Disabled Persons; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Income; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Middle Aged; Psychological Distress; Social Class; Stress, Psychological",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."

We conducted a systematic review to identify prospective, controlled studies of mental health treatments in LMIC. We defined 'mental health treatment' as an intervention for individuals experiencing mental ill health (including substance misuse) including a substantial psychosocial or pharmacological component. Studies had to measure a mental health and IPV outcome. We searched across multi-disciplinary databases using a structured search strategy. Screening of title/abstracts and full-text eligibility assessments were conducted by two researchers independently, data were extracted using a piloted spreadsheet, and a narrative synthesis was generated. We identified seven studies reported in 11 papers conducted in five middle-income countries. With the exception of blinding, studies overall showed acceptable levels of risk of bias. Four of the seven studies focused on dedicated mental health treatments in various populations, including: common mental disorders in earthquake survivors; depression in primary care; alcohol misuse in men; and alcohol misuse in female adult sex workers. The dedicated mental health treatments targeting depression or alcohol misuse consistently reduced levels of these outcomes. The two studies targeting depression also reduced short-term IPV, but no IPV benefits were identified in the two alcohol-focused studies. The other three studies evaluated integrated interventions, in which a focus on substance misuse was part of efforts to reduce HIV/AIDS and violence against particularly vulnerable women. In contrast to the dedicated mental health interventions, the integrated interventions did not consistently reduce mental ill health or alcohol misuse compared to control conditions. Too few studies have been conducted to judge whether mental health treatments may provide a beneficial strategy to prevent or reduce IPV in LMIC. Key future research questions include: whether promising initial evidence on the effects of depression interventions on reducing IPV hold more broadly, the required intensity of mental health components in integrated interventions, and the identification of mechanisms of IPV that are amenable to mental health intervention.",2019,2,14,"BMC women's health","10.1186/s12905-019-0728-z","PMC6376658","BMC Womens Health","eng","D000293; D000328; D000368; D000369; D019548; D005260; D006801; D000066511; D008297; D001523; D008875; D011203; D011446; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Crime Victims; Female; Humans; Intimate Partner Violence; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Poverty; Prospective Studies; Young Adult","MR/S001255/1; R01 MH100470","NA","ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Not applicable.

Previous research reveals overlaps in the volumetric alterations observed in both adversity-exposed individuals and in psychosis-spectrum populations, highlighting the possibility that deviations in corticolimbic gray matter development may be one mechanism linking adversity and psychosis. Given that childhood adversity encompasses a wide range of adverse experiences, there is also a critical need to examine whether these different types of experiences have unique effects on corticolimbic regions. This study examined the association between childhood adversity and cortical, hippocampal, and amygdalar volume in a large sample of youth at clinical-high risk (CHR) for psychosis. We utilized a novel differentiated adversity approach that distinguishes exposures along dimensions of threat (e.g., abuse) and deprivation (e.g., poverty, neglect) to test for differential associations. Participants were drawn from the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study (NAPLS) and completed an MRI scan and a retrospective assessment of childhood adversity at baseline. We found that deprivation exposure, but not threat, was uniquely associated with smaller cortical volume and smaller right hippocampal volume in CHR youth. These associations were masked in a generalized risk model that utilized a total adversity score. The findings suggest that deprivation exposures during childhood contribute to the subtle volumetric reductions observed in clinical high-risk samples and highlight the importance of disentangling different dimensions of adversity.",2019,11,1,"Schizophrenia research","10.1016/j.schres.2019.01.048",NA,"Schizophr Res","eng","D000293; D000076783; D002540; D002648; D002649; D005260; D006624; D006801; D008032; D008137; D008279; D008297; D011203; D011618; D012306; D055815","Adolescent; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Cerebral Cortex; Child; Child Abuse; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Limbic System; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Poverty; Psychotic Disorders; Risk; Young Adult","U01 MH081928; U01 MH081902; U01 MH081984; U01 MH082022; U01 MH081988; U01 MH081944; U01 MH081857; U01 MH076989; U01 MH082004","NA",NA,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Emory School of Medicine, 12 Executive Park, Atlanta, GA 30329, United States; Department of Psychology, Emory University, 36 Eagle Row, Atlanta, GA 30322, United States."

The current study conducted on all 270 breast cancer patients that were admitted to one of the hospitals of Arak University Medical Sciences (Arak, Iran from April to July 2018) by census (using non-random sampling (accessible sampling). SES was calculated by asset-based questionnaire and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to estimate the families' SES. Concentration Index (C) and Curve (CC) was used to measure SES inequality in SRH. The data were analysed with Stata software. The number of persons with good SRH by the level of SES was 165 (61.1%) and with poor SRH was 105 (38.9%). The number of persons with good SRH in comparison to same-aged people by level of SES was 135 (50%) and with poor SRH was 135 (50%). Concentration index of SRH in all level of SES was 0.061 (SE = 0.03). Also, Concentration index for SRH in comparison to same-aged people at different levels of SES was -0.044 (SE = 0.03).

In addition, no reliable methods to identify patients who will&#xa0;benefit from treatment is available. In this study, we show that citalopram, a commonly used SSRI, produces a dose-dependent amplification of the influence of the environment on mood, making the severity of symptoms dependent on the level of socioeconomic status (SES). As a consequence, based on SES, we were able to predict which patients would show remission following 12 weeks of treatment in the high, but not the low dose group. Our findings support a novel mechanism of action for SSRIs, which calls for a permissive rather than an instructive role of these drugs, and indicate that treatment outcome can be predicted based on SES and dose. Finally, our findings suggest that the patient's social and economic conditions should be considered in setting up personalized strategies aimed at enhancing SSRI efficacy.",2019,12,1,"The pharmacogenomics journal","10.1038/s41397-019-0080-6",NA,"Pharmacogenomics J","eng","D000293; D000328; D000339; D000368; D000928; D015283; D003865; D005260; D006801; D008297; D008875; D011379; D017367; D012923; D016896; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Aged; Antidepressive Agents; Citalopram; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; Social Class; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",NA,"10.1176/appi.ajp.163.1.28; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.09111680; 10.1155/2013/984845; 10.1001/archpsyc.58.4.395; 10.1038/478015a; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2010.08.011; 10.1038/mp.2017.68; 10.1038/mp.2015.142; 10.1371/journal.pone.0062226; 10.1038/tp.2017.35; 10.1038/mp.2010.122; 10.1038/35072566; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2014.09.008; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.08.022; 10.1017/S0033291703001107; 10.1007/s11920-007-0061-3; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08101.x; 10.1007/s00127-008-0436-8; 10.1097/01.psy.0000170338.75346.d0; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.0025; 10.1017/S003329171300192X; 10.1186/1471-244X-8-4; 10.1002/jclp.20213; 10.1111/j.1750-8606.2009.00110.x; 10.1016/S0165-1781(01)00270-0; 10.1016/S0165-0327(98)00026-3; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2007.10.009; 10.4088/JCP.v61n0602; 10.1002/wps.20089; 10.1001/archinte.166.21.2314; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.11111616",NA,"Center for Behavioral Sciences and Mental Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanit&#xe0;, Rome, Italy."

We included population-based incidence studies that reported an age-adjusted RR with 95% confidence interval (CI) published 1 January 1977-12 October 2017 and used a random-effects model. We retrieved studies performed in Europe (n = 43), Israel (n = 3), Canada (n = 2) and Australia (n = 1). The meta-analysis yielded a RR, adjusted for age and sex, of 2.13 (95% CI 1.99-2.27) for NAPD and 2.94 (95% CI 2.28-3.79) for APD. The RRs diminished, but persisted after adjustment for SES. With reference to NAPD: a personal or parental history of migration to Europe from countries outside Europe was associated with a higher RR (RR = 2.94, 95% CI 2.63-3.29) than migration within Europe (RR = 1.88, 95% 1.62-2.18). The corresponding RR was lower in Israel (RR = 1.22; 0.99-1.50) and Canada (RR = 1.21; 0.85-1.74). The RR was highest among individuals with a black skin colour (RR = 4.19, 95% CI 3.42-5.14). The evidence of a difference in risk between first and second generation was insufficient.

Review of the health records of 2947 patients who received inpatient care for ADS between 2015 and 2017. Out of 2947, 31 (1%) were diagnosed with pellagra. Nearly two-thirds (64.5%) of those with pellagra were from a low-income group. Of the clinical-triad of pellagra, all patients had dermatitis, more than half (58%) had delirium, a minority (19%) had diarrhoea. Nearly two-thirds (61%) had presented in a complicated-withdrawal state. Associated conditions included peripheral neuropathy (32%); Wernicke's encephalopathy (26%); seizures (16%).Seventeen (54%) had BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m2. Treatment was a high dose of parenteral vitamins including niacin (mean dose: 1500 mg/day) for an average of 7.5 days followed by oral multivitamin supplements. All had complete resolution of pellagrous symptoms by the end of the three weeks of inpatient care. Pellagra is an acute medical condition, frequently encountered in the context of alcohol dependence and poverty. It often presents with other disabling and life-threatening comorbidities like delirium tremens and Wernicke's encephalopathy. The classical triad of pellagra is only seen in a minority of cases.

Therefore, our goal was to analyze the association between physical injury and depression using nationally representative data from six LMICs. Cross-sectional data from the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) survey (2007-2010) were analyzed (N&#x202f;=&#x202f;42,489). Questions based on the World Mental Health Survey version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview were used for the endorsement of past 12-month DSM-IV depression. Any injury in our analysis referred to having experienced traffic injury or other injury in the past 12 months. Multivariable logistic regression analysis and meta-analyses were used to assess associations. Overall, the prevalence of depression was higher among those who had any injury compared to those without injuries (9.0% vs. 3.7%). Compared to having no injury, any injury without disability was associated with a 1.72 (95%CI=1.18-2.50) times higher odds for depression, while the odds for injury with disability was much higher (OR&#xa0;=3.81; 95%CI=2.16-6.73).

In a study cohort of 1,216 normal young adults, we failed to find significant main effects of family SES on MD; however, previously observed main effects of family SES on regional gray matter volume and fractional anisotropy (FA) were partly replicated. We found a significant effect of the interaction between sex and family income on MD in the thalamus as well as significant effects of the interaction between sex and parents' educational qualification (year's of education) on MD and FA in the body of the corpus callosum as well as white matter areas between the anterior cingulate cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex. These results suggest the sex-specific associations of family SES with neural and/or cognitive mechanisms particularly in neural tissues in brain areas that play key roles in basic information processing and higher-order cognitive processes in a way females with greater family SES level show imaging outcome measures that have been associated with more neural tissues (such as greater FA and lower MD) and males showed opposite.",2018,1,1,"Frontiers in human neuroscience","10.3389/fnhum.2018.00543","PMC6345688","Front Hum Neurosci","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.01.003; 10.1038/nrn1201; 10.1007/BF00240516; 10.1126/science.1115455; 10.1002/nbm.782; 10.3102/10769986025001060; 10.1037/0022-0663.87.3.476; 10.1136/jech.57.1.40; 10.1037/0278-6133.27.2.268; 10.1073/pnas.0608961104; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4628-05.2006; 10.1017/S1092852900013754; 10.1111/1467-8624.00469; 10.1111/j.0956-7976.2005.01575.x; 10.1073/pnas.0811910106; 10.1093/scan/nsn003; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.1475; 10.1353/dem.2007.0004; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.00997.x; 10.1016/0001-8791(89)90012-2; 10.1371/journal.pone.0018712; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.06.061; 10.1038/mp.2009.55; 10.1038/pr.2015.202; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e31825e32e8; 10.1002/hbm.20874; 10.1162/jocn.2009.21101; 10.1002/hbm.22934; 10.1038/nn.2303; 10.1111/desc.12096; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.3139; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.09.032; 10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00169-1; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2007.02.006; 10.1038/nn.3983; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2012.01147.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00600.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00542.x; 10.1136/jech.2006.052811; 10.1016/0006-8993(71)90153-3; 10.1371/journal.pone.0162511; 10.1046/j.1469-7580.2000.19730335.x; 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.01.025; 10.1101/lm.1914110; 10.1371/journal.pone.0140655; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.21-16-06292.2001; 10.3102/00346543075003417; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.03.061; 10.1080/14622200802323274; 10.1177/1073858415610294; 10.1038/mp.2015.193; 10.1038/srep29912; 10.1007/s00429-016-1262-5; 10.1093/cercor/bhr371; 10.1007/s00429-014-0845-2; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.037; 10.1002/hbm.22294; 10.1007/s00429-012-0485-3; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.02.078; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.04.004; 10.1093/cercor/bhy189; 10.1038/s41598-018-21985-8; 10.1007/s11682-018-0025-8; 10.1002/hbm.22027; 10.1006/nimg.2001.0978; 10.1111/psyp.12547; 10.3758/s13415-015-0371-6; 10.1038/nn921",NA,"Division of Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan."

Here, we report the validation of a Syndrome Evaluation System (SES) developed for simultaneous detection of multiple AES pathogens using a well characterized set of Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. The validation of the SES was carried out in two phases. In the first phase, the SES was validated using 51 CSF samples obtained from autopsy proven cases and 50 samples obtained from apparently healthy individuals undergoing spinal anesthesia for minor surgeries served as ""controls."" The SES detected etilogical agent in 48/51 (94.11 %) samples obtained from autopsy proven AES cases while all the 50 CSF samples obtained from ""controls"" were negative. In the second phase, the SES was validated using well characterized CSF samples obtained from AES patients fulfilling the WHO case definition of AES (Group I; <i>n</i> = 207) and samples that were collected from patients with non-infectious neurological disorder (Group II; <i>n</i> = 90). All the samples were tested using multiple conventional/serological assays and categorized into various groups. Amongst the AES cases fulfilling WHO case definition, the SES detected AES pathogens in 160/207 (77.29%) cases while conventional serological/molecular assays were able to detect AES pathogens only in 77/207 (37.1%) of cases. Further, in 12/83 CSF samples that were positive by SES and negative by conventional serological/molecular tests, the results were additionally confirmed by sequencing the PCR products to rule out non-specific amplification in the SES. In patients with non-infectious neurological disorders the SES detected latent viruses 12/90 CSF samples.

These differences are often attributed to GA or familial socio-economic status (SES). However, additional factors are increasingly recognized as likely contributors. Parental stress after a child's premature birth can present as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and can in turn reinforce difficulties in parent-child interaction pattern. Following a longitudinal design, we studied the interplay between a premature child's perinatal history and maternal PTSD symptoms on intelligence abilities assessed at 11 years of age. Thirty-three very preterm and 21 full-term mother-children dyads partook in the study. Children's perinatal risk was evaluated at hospital discharge, maternal PTSD symptoms were assessed when the children were 18 months old, and children's IQ was measured at 11 years old. IQ was significantly lower for preterm than full-term children, without reliable influences from perinatal risk scores. However, lower maternal PTSD symptoms predicted higher IQ in preterm children.

To date, most studies examining the impact of these risk factors on the development and functioning of the intestinal microbiota have primarily been conducted in high-income countries. However, arguably, children in low- and middle-income countries may be at increased risk given cumulative biological and psychosocial adversities during their development. Accumulating evidence in low- and middle-income countries has linked dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota to child health outcomes such as stunting, malnutrition, and diarrheal diseases characterized by reduced microbial diversity and elevated pathogenic bacteria, which has implications for psychosocial outcomes. This review summarizes empirical findings that highlight the association between risk factors prevalent in low- and middle-income countries and the intestinal microbiota of children. Additionally, we briefly survey the current evidence regarding the effect of nutritional interventions on the microbial composition of children in low- and middle-income countries.

A meta-analysis of 680 studies involving 793 independent samples and more than 370,000 participants found that Gf was moderately related to reading, r = .38, 95% CI [.36, .39], and mathematics, r = .41, 95% CI [.39, 44]. Synthesis on the longitudinal correlations showed that Gf and reading/mathematics predicted each other in the development even after controlling for initial performance. Moderation analyses revealed the following findings: (a) Gf showed stronger relations to mathematics than to reading, (b) within reading or mathematics, Gf showed stronger relations to complex skills than to foundational skills, (c) the relations between Gf and reading/mathematics increased with age, and (d) family social economic status (SES) mostly affected the relations between Gf and reading/mathematics in the early development stage. These findings, taken together, are partially in line with the investment theory but are more in line with the intrinsic cognitive load theory, mutualism theory, and the gene-SES interaction hypothesis of cognition and learning. More importantly, these findings imply an integration model of these theories from an educational and developmental perspective: Children may rely on Gf to learn reading and mathematics early on, when high family SES can boost the effects of Gf on reading/mathematics performance. As children receive more formal schooling and gain more learning experiences, their reading and mathematics improvement may promote their Gf development. During development, the negative effects of low family SES on the relations between Gf and reading/mathematics may be offset by education/learning experiences.

This cohort study used data from 1082 mother-child pairs in the University of Tennessee Health Science Center-Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development and Learning and Early Childhood project to examine the association between networks of different levels of complexity (triad, family, and neighborhood) and child cognitive performance after adjustment for the mother's IQ, birth weight, and age, and the father's educational level. The final model was adjusted for the household poverty level. Data were collected from December 2006 through January 2014 and analyzed from October through November 2018. The child-mother relationship, child-mother-father triad, family setting, child's dwelling network, mother's social support network, and neighborhood networks. Measure of cognitive development of the child using Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) at 2 years of age. Of 1082 participants, 544 (50.3%) were males and 703 (65.1%) were African American; the mean (SD) age was 2.08 (0.12) years. Large family size had a negative association with early cognitive development, with a mean 2.21-point decrease in BSID coefficient score (95% CI, 0.40 to 4.02; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01). Mother's social support network size was positively associated early cognitive development, with a mean 0.40-point increase in BSID coefficient score (95% CI, 0.001 to 0.80; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.05). Knowing many neighbors was not statistically significantly associated with early cognitive development, with a mean 1.39-point increase in BSID coefficient score (95% CI, -0.04 to 2.83; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.06). The findings suggest that maternal social relationships are associated with cognitive development in children and that social relationships beyond the mother-child-father triad are significantly associated with children's cognitive development.

A community-based epilepsy awareness program was carried out by our group in the rural areas of the Chaco region, Plurinational state of Bolivia, to improve the knowledge about epilepsy, with a first part directed toward general practitioners and a second part toward nurses and community health workers (CHWs) of the rural communities with a positive outcome. The objective of the study was to assess the level of knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward epilepsy, the stigma related to epilepsy and the quality of life in people with epilepsy (PWE) before and after the interventional campaign directed toward representative members of the rural communities in the Chaco region in Bolivia. The study was conducted in three areas of Bolivia. Key subjects from each community were randomly selected. Before and after the courses they answered a questionnaire to assess their knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and practices about epilepsy, a validated Stigma Scale of Epilepsy (SSE) and Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-10 (QOLIE-10). Two hundred sixteen subjects were involved in the program. Only 133 (61.6%) subjects completed the questionnaires a month after the educational program. A significant improvement was recorded in knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward epilepsy, and a significant reduction was found in the mean SSE total score (38.3&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;14.7 vs. 28.5&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;12.3; p&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;0.01), reflecting a reduction of stigma levels.

This study examines the associations between current and lifetime markers of SES and BMI categories (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese) and central adiposity in Ghanaian adults. Data from 4,464 adults (2,610 women) who participated in the World Health Organization's Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) Wave 2 were examined. Multilevel multinomial and binomial logistic regression models were used to examine associations. SES markers included parental education, individual education, intergenerational educational mobility and household wealth. Intergenerational educational mobility was classified: stable-low (low parental and low individual education), stable-high (high parental and high individual education), upwardly (low parental and high individual education), or downwardly mobile (high parental and low individual education). The prevalence of obesity (12.9%) exceeded the prevalence of underweight (7.2%) in the population. High parental and individual education were significantly associated with higher odds of obesity and central adiposity in women. Compared to the stable low pattern, stable high (obesity: OR = 3.15; 95% CI: 1.96, 5.05; central adiposity: OR = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.03, 2.98) and upwardly (obesity: OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 11.13, 2.60; central adiposity: OR = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.37) mobile education patterns were associated with higher odds of obesity and central adiposity in women, while stable high pattern was associated with higher odds of overweight (OR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.11, 3.19) in men. Additionally, high compared to the lowest household wealth was associated with high odds of obesity and central adiposity in both sexes.

In this longitudinal study we tested 186 patients with TBI and 54 healthy controls from the Vietnam Head Injury Study. Childhood SES was determined for each participant based on parental educational attainment and occupational prestige. General intelligence was initially assessed pre-injury upon induction into the military, and again 15, 35 and 40+ years post-injury. We examined whether childhood SES, total brain volume loss and lesion laterality can predict post-injury intelligence scores and the rate of change in those scores between study phases. For both participants with and without TBI, childhood SES accounted for a significant portion of the variance in intelligence scores pre-injury and in all three post-injury evaluations, however, it was not associated with the rate of cognitive change. Lastly, childhood SES predicted cognitive outcome among patients with left hemisphere damage better than it did for right hemisphere damage patients. These findings provide the first evidence indicating the persistent effects of childhood SES on intelligence scores later in adulthood following a TBI.

We examined whether these exposures were linked to symptoms of emotional and behavioral problems in offspring at 2&#xa0;years of age, or if associations were due to confounding variables. Methods Data from 815 mother-child pairs enrolled at the Edmonton site of the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development cohort were used to examine associations between gestational metabolic complications and scores on the externalizing and internalizing scales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL-1&#xbd; to 5) at age two. Associations between maternal metabolic complications and offspring psychopathology were assessed before and after adjustment for gestational diet, socioeconomic status (SES), postpartum depression (PPD), prenatal smoking and breastfeeding. Results Pre-pregnancy body mass index and GDM, but not gestational weight gain, predicted more offspring externalizing and internalizing problems. However, after adjustment for confounding variables, these associations were no longer statistically significant. Post-hoc analyses revealed that gestational diet accounted for unique variance in both externalizing (semi-partial r<sub>diet</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.20, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and internalizing (semi-partial r<sub>diet</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.16, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01) problems.

Seventy-two consecutive outpatients with schizophrenia (DSM-5) were randomly assigned for 6&#xa0;months to: (1) PP1M (50-150&#xa0;mg equivalent) or (2) paliperidone ER (6-12&#xa0;mg/day). Participants were assessed at baseline and after 6&#xa0;months with the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM); the Subjective Well-being under Neuroleptics Scale (SWN-K); the Service Engagement Scale (SES); the Clinical Global Impression-Schizophrenia (CGI-SCH); and the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) score. ANOVA repeated measures was performed. Intention-to-treat analysis with last observation carried forward was conducted. We found a significant within-subjects effect (trial duration) for all rating scale except for cognitive symptoms and the TSQM domain ""side effects"". A significant effect between subjects (treatment modality) was found for the CGI negative symptoms, the TSQM domains ""overall satisfaction"" and ""convenience,"" and the SES. There were seven drop-outs (9.7%): twi due to hyperprolactinemia and five for lack of compliance. Significant differences between the two formulations were found. PP1M was superior to paliperidone ER on global treatment satisfaction and convenience, on service engagement, and in reducing negative symptoms. The trial was registered in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) with the code: ACTRN12618001113246.",2019,2,1,"Clinical drug investigation","10.1007/s40261-018-0734-1",NA,"Clin Drug Investig","eng","D000284; D000328; D000553; D014150; D003692; D005260; D006801; D008297; D008875; D000068882; D017060; D012559","Administration, Oral; Adult; Ambulatory Care; Antipsychotic Agents; Delayed-Action Preparations; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Paliperidone Palmitate; Patient Satisfaction; Schizophrenia",NA,"10.1093/schbul/sbs135; 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2013.01.012; 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2014.11.006; 10.1097/YCO.0b013e32832c920b; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2016.05.008; 10.2165/00023210-200418130-00004; 10.2165/00023210-200620040-00003; 10.1159/000232973; 10.1186/1471-244X-6-45; 10.1001/archpsyc.63.10.1079; 10.1093/schbul/sbn067; 10.2147/ndt.s130483; 10.4088/JCP.v65n0709; 10.1007/s40263-016-0350-7; 10.1097/YIC.0000000000000093; 10.1007/s00213-016-4445-0; 10.1016/j.schres.2016.03.020; 10.1176/ps.2006.57.4.521; 10.1007/s10597-014-9740-9; 10.1007/s10597-015-9935-8; 10.1007/s00406-016-0710-9; 10.1016/j.schres.2009.10.026; 10.1177/0269881110372817; 10.1097/YIC.0000000000000092; 10.1080/14740338.2017.1288716; 10.2147/NDT.S161186; 10.1097/YIC.0000000000000195; 10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596; 10.1097/YIC.0b013e32833db3d8; 10.1186/1477-7525-2-12; 10.1080/09638230020023570-2; 10.1034/j.1600-0447.107.s416.5.x; 10.4088/JCP.v66n1113; 10.1097/YIC.0000000000000141; 10.1016/j.schres.2017.04.004; 10.1016/S0920-9964(14)70362-7; 10.2147/NDT.S112542; 10.1186/s12888-016-0883-9; 10.1097/00004850-200101001-00002; 10.1007/s40263-013-0070-1; 10.1016/j.schres.2015.08.015; 10.3109/15622975.2012.739708; 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.077289; 10.1093/schbul/21.3.419; 10.1046/j.1440-1800.2001.00099.x; 10.1016/j.schres.2010.11.020; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2011.10081224; 10.1097/YIC.0b013e32835d30ae; 10.3109/15622975.2014.902990; 10.1111/eip.12278; 10.1080/14656566.2016.1174692; 10.1177/2045125316673012; 10.1016/j.psychres.2008.10.009; 10.1097/JGP.0b013e31815a3e7a",NA,"Department of Neuroscience, ""Rita Levi Montalcini"", University of Turin, Turin, Italy."
"30534102","Associations Between Pet Ownership and Attitudes Toward Pets With Youth Socioemotional Outcomes.","Kristen C Jacobson, Laura Chang","Evidence regarding the effects of pet ownership and related variables on youth socioemotional development is mixed. Inconsistencies across studies may be due to a variety of factors, including the use of different outcomes measured across studies, small potential effect sizes, and use of selected samples. In addition, studies have not systematically controlled for demographic characteristics that may bias results, nor have studies systematically examined whether effects are consistent across different subgroups. The present study examined the impact of pet ownership and attitudes toward pets on four measures of youth socioemotional outcomes: delinquency, depressed mood, empathy, and prosocial behavior. Linear mixed-effect regression analyses were conducted on 342 youth (48.0% male) aged 9-19 (<i>M</i> = 14.05, <i>SD</i> = 1.77) from a racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse sample. The majority (59.1%) of youth currently lived with a dog or cat and all participants completed the Pet Attitude Scale-Modified. Pet owners reported lower delinquency and higher empathy than non-owners; however, group differences became non-significant once demographic factors were controlled for. Attitudes toward pets was significantly associated with all four outcomes. More positive attitudes was modestly associated with lower delinquency (&#x3b2; = -0.22, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and higher empathy (&#x3b2; = 0.31, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with smaller effects for depressed mood (&#x3b2; = -0.12, <i>p</i> = 0.04) and prosocial behavior (&#x3b2; = 0.12, <i>p</i> = 0.02). For delinquency, empathy, and prosocial behavior, effects were only slightly attenuated and remained statistically significant after controlling for gender, age, race/ethnicity, family socioeconomic status, and pet ownership, although the effect for depressed mood became non-significant after inclusion of these demographic factors. While there was some variability in effect sizes across different subgroups, none of the interactions between attitudes toward pets and gender, race/ethnicity, age, family SES, or pet ownership was statistically significant, indicating that the effects may transcend individual differences in demographic characteristics. Overall, the study adds to a growing body of work supporting a positive relationship between emotional bonds with pets and youth socioemotional outcomes and offers potential explanations for inconsistencies across previous studies.",2018,1,1,"Frontiers in psychology","10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02304","PMC6275470","Front Psychol","eng",NA,NA,"DP2 OD003021; R03 HD066598","10.2752/175303710X12627079939341; 10.1016/j.pedn.2010.11.009; 10.2752/089279301786999391; 10.1163/156853003321618873; 10.1016/j.appdev.2017.01.003; 10.1007/s10802-013-9754-8; 10.2752/175303714X13837396326251; 10.4135/9781452232959.n6; 10.2307/1131625; 10.2752/089279303786992026; 10.2752/089279306785593801; 10.1037/0012-1649.32.2.195; 10.2752/175303710X12750451258931; 10.1037/14856-000; 10.2752/089279393787002303; 10.5888/pcd12.150204; 10.2752/089279390787057829; 10.2752/089279302786992775; 10.2752/175303712X13479798785814; 10.1177/019394502320555377; 10.2752/089279392787011395; 10.2466/pr0.1989.65.3.903; 10.1111/j.1099-0860.1996.tb00595.x; 10.2752/089279303786992170; 10.2174/1876391X00901010051; 10.1111/j.1440-1754.2010.01830.x; 10.1348/000712600161673; 10.1177/0002764203255210; 10.1177/1403494809344358; 10.1136/vr.b4712; 10.2752/089279307X224773; 10.1007/s10803-012-1707-5; 10.2752/175303713X13697429463835; 10.2752/089279392787011340; 10.1016/0168-1591(95)01007-6; 10.3390/ijerph14030234; 10.1177/014662167700100306; 10.1007/s10578-014-0463-5; 10.1371/journal.pone.0179494; 10.2460/javma.236.5.529; 10.2466/pr0.1981.49.2.651; 10.1007/BF03394747; 10.2752/089279399787000129; 10.1186/1746-6148-9-102; 10.3390/ijerph7103704; 10.1186/1746-6148-3-5; 10.1163/156853007X187117",NA,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States."

Thus we assessed the association between diabetes and cataract in 6 LMICs. Cross-sectional, community-based data from the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) was analyzed (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;42,469 aged &#x2265;18&#x202f;years). Five years information on self-reported diagnosis of cataract was collected. Three definitions for cataract were used: (a) Self-reported diagnosis and/or past 12-month symptoms; (b) Solely self-reported diagnosis; and (c) Surgical treatment for cataract in the past five years. Diabetes was based on self-reported diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to assess the associations. Overall, the prevalence of diabetes was 3.1% (95%CI&#x202f;=&#x202f;2.7-3.5%) and that of cataract based on the three different definitions was: (a) 13.3% (95%CI&#x202f;=&#x202f;12.4-14.3%); (b) 4.4% (95%CI&#x202f;=&#x202f;3.9-4.8%), (c) 1.7% (95%CI&#x202f;=&#x202f;1.5-2.0%).

These associations were particularly pronounced among those aged &lt;50&#x202f;years. A strong association between diabetes and cataract was observed in LMICs.

The role of discrimination experiences in health service use.","Billy Gazard, Zoe Chui, Lisa Harber-Aschan, Shirlee MacCrimmon, Ioannis Bakolis, Katharine Rimes, Matthew Hotopf, Stephani L Hatch","Discrimination is a well-established stressor that is substantially associated with poor health and a known contributor to health inequalities. However, the role of discrimination in health service use is less explored. This study will take an intersectional approach to investigate differences in health service use and examine the role of discrimination experiences. Data on health service use were assessed in a diverse inner London sample of 1052 participants in the South East London Community Health (SELCoH) Study. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to define classes of intersectional social status using multiple indicators of socioeconomic status (SES), ethnicity and migration status. Adjusted associations between intersectional social status and discrimination experiences with health service use indicators are presented. Using latent class analysis allowed us to identify an intersectional social status characterized by multiple disadvantage that was associated with decreased secondary physical health service use and a class characterized by both privilege and disadvantage that was associated with increased health service use for mental disorder after controlling for age, gender and health status. Anticipated discrimination was also associated with increased service use for mental disorder in adjusted models. There was no evidence to suggest that discrimination experiences were acting as a barrier to health service use. This study highlights the complex ways in which discrimination experiences may increase the need for health services whilst also highlighting differences in health service use at the intersection of ethnicity, migration status and SES. Findings from this study illustrate the importance of measuring multiple levels of discrimination and taking an intersectional approach for health service use research.",2018,12,7,"BMC public health","10.1186/s12889-018-6267-y","PMC6286602","BMC Public Health","eng","D000293; D000328; D004641; D005006; D005260; D006297; D006801; D008131; D008297; D008875; D010342; D012923; D063508; D013315; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Emigration and Immigration; Ethnicity; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; London; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Social Class; Social Discrimination; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult","203380/Z/16/Z; RES-177-25-0015","10.1037/a0035754; 10.1037/a0016059; 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032814-112728; 10.2105/AJPH.2016.303121; 10.1016/S0277-9536(01)00193-9; 10.1136/jech.2006.058404; 10.1016/j.healthplace.2005.08.016; 10.2105/AJPH.2012.300773; 10.1007/s11606-013-2441-1; 10.2105/AJPH.2011.300620; 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61817-6; 10.1037/a0020102; 10.1186/1471-2288-6-35; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.07.016; 10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00415-9; 10.1186/1472-6963-11-288; 10.1186/1471-2458-11-861; 10.3390/ijerph120910687; 10.1007/s00038-012-0429-y; 10.1080/13557858.2012.654770; 10.1017/S0033291700030415; 10.1097/00006842-200203000-00008; 10.2105/AJPH.93.2.262; 10.2105/AJPH.2012.300666; 10.1111/josi.12058; 10.1007/s10865-013-9496-7; 10.1192/bjp.182.2.105; 10.1177/0022146514521215; 10.1001/archpsyc.62.6.603; 10.1007/s00127-012-0565-y","ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: The authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008.

"30501640","Epidemiology of onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy in the Mbam and Sanaga river valleys of Cameroon: impact of more than 13&#xa0;years of ivermectin.","Joseph Nelson Siewe Fodjo, Godwin Tatah, Earnest Njih Tabah, Leonard Ngarka, Leonard Njamnshi Nfor, Samuel Eric Chokote, Michel K Mengnjo, Fid&#xe8;le Dema, Aur&#xe9;lien Tele Sitouok,  ..., Alfred K Njamnshi","A high epilepsy prevalence has been reported in several onchocerciasis-endemic villages along the Mbam and Sanaga river valleys in Cameroon, including Bilomo and Kelleng. We sought to determine the prevalence of epilepsy in these two villages following more than 13&#xa0;years of community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI). Door-to-door surveys were performed on the entire resident population in the villages in August 2017 and January 2018. Epilepsy was diagnosed using a 2-step approach: administration of a standardized 5-item questionnaire followed by confirmation by a neurologist. Previously published diagnostic criteria for onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy (OAE) were used. Ov16 serology was done for children aged 7-10&#xa0;years to assess onchocerciasis transmission. Findings were compared with previous data from these two villages. A total of 1525 individuals (1321 in Bilomo and 204 in Kelleng) in 233 households were surveyed in both villages. The crude prevalence of epilepsy was 4.6% in Bilomo (2017) and 7.8% in Kelleng (2018), including 12 (15.6% of cases) persons with epilepsy (PWE) with nodding seizures. The age and sex-standardized prevalence in Kelleng decreased from 13.5% in 2004 to 9.3% in 2018 (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The median age of PWE shifted from 17 (IQR: 12-22) years to 24 (IQR: 20-30) years in Bilomo (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001); and slightly from 24 (IQR: 14-34) years to 28 (IQR: 21.25-36.75) years in Kelleng (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.112). Furthermore, 47.6% of all tested children between 7 and 10&#xa0;years had Ov16 antibodies. There is a decrease in epilepsy prevalence after 13&#xa0;years and more of CDTI in both villages.

"33707809","Autonomic nervous system functioning assessed during the Still-Face Paradigm: A meta-analysis and systematic review of methods, approach and findings.","Karen Jones-Mason, Abbey Alkon, Michael Coccia, Nicole R Bush","Animal and human research suggests that the development of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is particularly sensitive to early parenting experiences. The Still-Face Paradigm (SFP), one of the most widely used measures to assess infant reactivity and emotional competence, evokes infant self-regulatory responses to parental interaction and disengagement. This systematic review of 33 peer-reviewed studies identifies patterns of parasympathetic (PNS) and sympathetic (SNS) nervous system activity demonstrated by infants under one year of age during the SFP and describes findings within the context of sample demographic characteristics, study methodologies, and analyses conducted. A meta-analysis of a subset of 14 studies with sufficient available respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) data examined whether the SFP reliably elicited PNS withdrawal (RSA decrease) during parental disengagement or PNS recovery (RSA increase) during reunion, and whether results differed by socioeconomic status (SES). Across SES, the meta-analysis confirmed that RSA decreased during the still-face episode and increased during reunion. When studies were stratified by SES, low-SES or high-risk groups also showed RSA decreases during the still face episode but failed to show an increase in RSA during reunion. Few studies have examined SNS activity during the SFP to date, preventing conclusions in that domain. The review also identified multiple qualifications to patterns of SFP ANS findings, including those that differed by ethnicity, infant sex, parental sensitivity, and genetics. Strengths and weaknesses in the extant research that may explain some of the variation in findings across the literature are also discussed, and suggestions for strengthening future research are provided.",2018,12,1,"Developmental review : DR","10.1016/j.dr.2018.06.002","PMC7945875","Dev Rev","eng",NA,NA,"R01 HL116511","10.1097/DBP.0b013e3182331fa6; 10.1371/journal.pone.0086283; 10.1002/dev.10082; 10.1002/dev.20129; 10.1007/s00406-005-0624-4; 10.1080/15374410701662840; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2005.08.008; 10.1080/14616734.2016.1167095; 10.1007/s00127-014-0954-5; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02327.x; 10.1113/jphysiol.2011.222422; 10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2014.04.007; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181ad1c8b; 10.1016/j.jecp.2014.02.007; 10.1037/a0027829; 10.1017/S0954579417001237; 10.1016/j.jecp.2011.03.004; 10.1002/dev.21508; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2006.09.005; 10.1038/mp.2010.53; 10.1016/j.infbeh.2010.01.001; 10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00130; 10.1177/0956797612457381; 10.1016/j.chc.2014.01.002; 10.1097/CHI.0b013e31802b91ea; 10.1037/a0026518; 10.1002/dev.20036; 10.1017/S0954579411000034; 10.1017/S0954579410000611; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00890.x; 10.1080/01443610220130526; 10.1002/da.10071; 10.1002/dev.20366; 10.1111/j.1469-8986.2006.00490.x; 10.1093/jpepsy/jsp113; 10.1002/dev.20397; 10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2010.07.004; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2013.04.011; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2005.11.014; 10.1016/j.infbeh.2013.02.003; 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2006.00251.x; 10.1196/annals.1376.038; 10.1080/10503300802609672; 10.1002/dev.21221; 10.1037/a0032671; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2010.01.004; 10.1002/brb3.480; 10.1037/a0037509; 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00213; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2011.11.009; 10.1177/1077559510387662; 10.1016/j.infbeh.2014.04.005; 10.1016/j.infbeh.2012.11.009; 10.1073/pnas.1423363112; 10.1016/j.infbeh.2013.06.004; 10.1016/j.dr.2009.02.001; 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2009.06.005; 10.2217/epi-2016-0010; 10.1002/dev.21251; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02171.x; 10.1017/S095457940999023X; 10.1037/0012-1649.40.6.1068; 10.1037/0012-1649.37.5.706; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01255.x; 10.1037/a0012665; 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.01137.x; 10.1017/S0954579409990290; 10.1186/s13229-015-0007-2; 10.1002/dev.21448; 10.1080/14616734.2014.967786; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2006.06.009; 10.1017/S0954579415000760; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01194.x; 10.1016/j.jecp.2015.07.003; 10.1016/j.dr.2016.07.001; 10.1017/S0954579414000480; 10.1111/cdev.12641; 10.1002/dev.21403; 10.1371/journal.pone.0052729; 10.1111/jcpp.12226; 10.1371/journal.pone.0045446; 10.1001/jama.2009.754; 10.1080/14616730500365928; 10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.07.003; 10.1017/S0954579416000456; 10.1017/S0954579414000194; 10.1037/a0021631; 10.1037/0012-1649.41.5.711; 10.1371/journal.pone.0030413; 10.1111/psyp.12300; 10.1007/s10802-015-0039-2; 10.1177/0956797613518352; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.06.011",NA,"Department of Psychiatry, Center for Health and Community, Weill Neurosciences Institute, University of California, San Francisco."

Stress disproportionately affects females, who are at increased risk for stress-related pathologies associated with cognitive impairment. Mechanisms underlying stress-associated cognitive impairment and enhanced risk of females remain unknown. Here, ELS is associated with impaired rule-reversal (RR) learning in females, but not males. Impaired performance was associated with decreased expression and density of interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV+) in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), but not other interneuron subtypes. Optogenetic silencing of PV+ interneuron activity in OFC of control mice phenocopied RR learning deficits observed in ELS females. Localization of reversal learning deficits to PV+ interneurons in OFC was confirmed by optogenetic studies in which neurons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were silenced and associated with select deficits in rule-shift learning. Sex-, cell-, and region-specific effects show altered PV+ interneuron development can be a driver of sex differences in cognitive dysfunction.",2018,11,27,"Cell reports","10.1016/j.celrep.2018.11.010","PMC6310486","Cell Rep","eng","D000818; D002452; D005260; D007395; D008297; D008810; D010320; D017397; D012333; D012193; D012727; D013315","Animals; Cell Count; Female; Interneurons; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Parvalbumins; Prefrontal Cortex; RNA, Messenger; Reversal Learning; Sex Characteristics; Stress, Psychological","F31 MH111131; P20 GM103645; R01 MH115049; F99 NS105219; T32 NS062443; R01 MH115914; K00 MH124183","10.1038/s41386-018-0195-5","DECLARATION OF INTERESTS.

We identified and collated all the papers related to the 10/66 Dementia Research Group, including papers from groups who adopted the 10/66 methodology, that have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Over 200 papers including data from Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean were identified by this review. Many of the findings revolved around the epidemiology of dementia, mental health and non-communicable diseases, including the cross-cultural development and validation of measurement tools of cognition and functioning, need for care, care arrangements and mental health. Social ageing, care dependence and caregiver interventions were also topics that the group had published on. A body of evidence has been generated that has challenged the view, prevalent when the group started, that dementia is comparatively rare in LMICs. The experience of the 10/66 DRG has shown that descriptive epidemiological research can be important and impactful, where few data exist.

We undertook a systematic search of studies and review 21 papers that examined both SES and brain development or functioning as measured during adolescence or young adulthood in nonclinical populations (13-25 years old). Few studies focused on architecture and such findings were varied. The majority of studies focused on functioning with two themes emerging. First, studies demonstrate different activation in regions of interest to cognitive and behavioral tasks relative to SES. Second, when similar neurological activation is evident, they can be related to different behavioral observations relative to SES. There is also evidence of different neurological functioning associated with SES with regard to different conceptualizations and coding of SES. Further, some of the reviewed studies identified potential mediators to the relationship, such as parenting practices, stress, and IQ. Overall, the findings suggest it is important to consider SES and neighborhood context within neuroscience research and practice.",2019,10,1,"Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence","10.1080/09297049.2018.1549209",NA,"Child Neuropsychol","eng","D000293; D041923; D000328; D001921; D005260; D006801; D008297; D012923; D055815","Adolescent; Adolescent Development; Adult; Brain; Female; Humans; Male; Social Class; Young Adult",NA,"NA",NA,"c School of Journalism and Mass Communication , University of Wisconsin , Madison , WI , USA."

This study utilized a Bayesian spatiotemporal approach to examine risk factors for substantiated child abuse and neglect over a 9-year period across zip codes in Davidson County, TN. Risk of child sexual and physical abuse decreased from 2008 to 2016. In contrast, risk of child neglect increased from 2011 to 2014, followed by a rapid decrease in risk. Whereas higher percentages of families living in poverty were associated with higher risk of all maltreatment subtypes, higher unemployment rates were uniquely associated with risk of child neglect.

The objective of this longitudinal study was to examine the direct and indirect paths through which cSES influences late midlife cognitive outcomes. Participants were 1,009 male twins in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA). At mean ages 20 and 62, participants completed a standardized test for general cognitive ability (GCA). The age 62 cognitive assessment also included in-person tests of processing speed, episodic memory, abstract reasoning, working memory, verbal fluency, visual-spatial ability, and executive functions. At mean age 56, participants were interviewed regarding their own and their parents' education and occupation, and completed questionnaires about cognitive leisure activities and sociodemographic information. Multiple mediation analyses were conducted to examine the direct path effects and indirect path effects of cSES through age 20 GCA, adult SES, and cognitive leisure activities on seven cognitive outcomes at age 62, adjusting for age, ethnicity, and non-independence of observations. Total (direct plus indirect) effects were significant for all measures with the exception of executive functions. Men from lower cSES backgrounds had poorer cognitive functioning in late midlife. The direct effect of cSES was partially mediated for abstract reasoning, and was fully mediated for the remaining six cognitive outcomes.

Considering the changes over the past 20 years little is known about the current epidemiological characteristics of epilepsy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The current study was focused to find the impact of various contributing factors on the clinical response to anti-epileptic drugs in the KP population, Pakistan. A total of 315 participants aged 19.1 &#xb1; 8.6 years were examined. Mean age of the patients was 18 &#xb1; 8.1 year. Epilepsy was high in male patients (64.39%) and urban areas (60.1%). Mostly, 88.6% of patients were belonging to low socioeconomic status background. 42.4% patients have positive family history for epilepsy and 42.8% patients had consanguineous marriages. Middle SES class patients (OR, 2.22 [CI, 0.54-9.1]) were slightly associated with controlled response to CBZ and VPA therapy. Absence seizure (OR, 1.16 [CI, 0.59-2.3]), and Complex partial seizure (OR, 1.29 [CI, 0.58-6.3]) showed good response to CBZ therapy while, Myoclonic seizure (OR, 2.23 [CI, 0.05-8.8]) was responsive to VPA therapy. However, non-compliance (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> 0.82, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001) and nature of seizures (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> 0.83, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001) were associated with the high risk for poor response to both CBZ and VPA therapy.

Nevertheless, very few studies have assessed this association in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In this cross-sectional survey, we investigated the association of cannabis use and suicidal attempts in adolescents from 21 LMICs, adjusting for potential confounders. Data from the Global school-based Student Health Survey was analyzed in 86,254 adolescents from 21 countries [mean (SD) age&#x2009;=&#x2009;13.7 (0.9) years; 49.0% girls]. Suicide attempts during past year and cannabis during past month and lifetime were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted. The overall prevalence of past 30-day cannabis use was 2.8% and the age-sex adjusted prevalence varied from 0.5% (Laos) to 37.6% (Samoa), while the overall prevalence of lifetime cannabis use was 3.9% (range 0.5%-44.9%). The overall prevalence of suicide attempts during the past year was 10.5%. Following multivariable adjustment to potential confounding variables, past 30-day cannabis use was significantly associated with suicide attempts (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.03; 95% CI: 1.42-2.91).

The objective of the present study was to assess whether there were differences in mental health and parenting stress among mothers whose diabetic child was managed in a patient-centred medical home or not. Two hundred fifty-three mothers of children with diabetes (mean age = 12.50 years; SD = 3.90) from the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health were included in this study. Hierarchical multiple regression was conducted to determine the amount of variance that having a patient-centred medical home contributed to maternal emotional/mental health and parenting stress. After controlling for child sex, age, race/ethnicity and family poverty level, patient-centred medical home status was associated with better mental health for mothers and less parenting stress. Effective care coordination was the only subcomponent of the patient-centred medical home that significantly contributed to the variance in mother's mental/emotional health and parenting stress.

Most rural Nigerian dwellers with CLBP consult unconventional practitioners due to difficulty in accessing conventional health care. This interaction may influence back pain beliefs and behaviours, and health outcomes including disability. In line with the recent Lancet Low Back Pain series call to address widespread misconceptions in the population and among health practitioners about low back pain, this study explored the beliefs and management strategies of unconventional practitioners consulted by people living with CLBP in rural Nigeria. Qualitative semi-structured face-to-face individual interviews. Thematic analysis of transcripts was performed using the Framework approach. Nine unconventional practitioners consented to participate in this study. Patent medicine sellers and herbalists had biomedical beliefs about CLBP and encouraged passivity and drug dependence in patients. Pastors adopted spiritual or biopsychosocial-spiritual management models and either encouraged spiritual CLBP causal beliefs and spiritual healing expectations; or patients' resilience and acceptance, respectively. Unconventional practitioners' CLBP beliefs and management strategies aligned with the beliefs and coping strategies of patients who consulted them.

We here conducted a nonsystematic review of the neuroimaging literature studying the effects of poverty, urbanicity, and community violence, highlighting the opportunities of studying non-Western developing societies such as those in Latin America. Social and environmental factors in these communities are widespread and have a large magnitude, as well as an unequal distribution, providing a good opportunity for their characterization. Studying the effect of poverty in these settings could help to explore the brain effect of economic improvements, disentangle the effect of absolute and relative poverty, and characterize the modulating impact of poverty on the underlying biology of mental health disorders. Exploring urbanicity effects in highly unequal cities could help identify the specific factors that modulate this effect as well as examine a possible dose-response effect by studying megacities. Studying brain changes in those living among violence, which is particularly high in places such as Latin America, could help to characterize the interplay between brain predisposition and exposure to violence. Furthermore, exploring the brain in an adverse environment should shed light on the mechanisms underlying resilience.

This epidemiological analysis identifies risk factors for the incidence of CIPN. This retrospective analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data examined predictors of incident CIPN claims among 11,149 women aged 66 years or older with American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) stage II to IV breast cancer (and no secondary cancer diagnosis or preexisting neuropathy) who received chemotherapy. Overall, new CIPN claims occurred for 8.3% of patients within 1 year of starting chemotherapy. Risk emerged approximately 3 months after the start of chemotherapy and increased throughout 1 year. Paclitaxel as part of first-line therapy increased CIPN risk 2.7-fold in comparison with nonneurotoxic agents (15.9% vs 5.0%), with lower incidence rates for carboplatin and paclitaxel (11.9%), carboplatin and docetaxel (9.3%), carboplatin alone (7.7%), and docetaxel alone (6.6%). The CIPN incidence rate was higher for women who at the time of their breast cancer diagnosis were relatively young (within this Medicare sample), were at AJCC stage II or III, were married or had an equivalent status, and had fewer comorbidities, but it did not differ by race/ethnicity or poverty level. These Medicare claims database findings indicate that women aged 66 years or older with breast cancer are susceptible to CIPN from taxane and/or platinum compounds, with risk emerging approximately 3 months into treatment. Prospective studies of symptom emergence and clinical response (eg, stopping chemotherapy and adjunctive treatments) are indicated to determine how best to inform patients of this risk and to manage CIPN in this population.",2019,1,15,"Cancer","10.1002/cncr.31798","PMC6329662","Cancer","eng","D000368; D000369; D000971; D001943; D016190; D015331; D000077143; D005260; D006801; D015994; D006278; D017239; D010523; D012189; D018426; D014481","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Breast Neoplasms; Carboplatin; Cohort Studies; Docetaxel; Female; Humans; Incidence; Medicare; Paclitaxel; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Retrospective Studies; SEER Program; United States","HHSN261201300011C; HHSN261201300011I; P30 CA022453","NA","CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES.

In the mid-1990s, PSID data supported a series of studies that link early childhood income to early adult attainments, particularly to completed schooling. At the same time, discoveries in neurobiology and epidemiology were beginning to provide details on the processes producing the observed correlations. These discoveries led to a more recent set of PSID-based studies that focus not only on labor market and behavioral outcomes, but also on links between income in the earliest stages of life (including the prenatal period) and adult health.

In Study 1 (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;1,182), we examined the profiles of CSB among adolescents using latent profile analysis. Results revealed the following three clusters: abstainers, sexual fantasizers, and individuals with CSB. In Study 2 (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;618), we replicated this classification and examined differences between the clusters in Big Five personality traits, locus of control, attachment orientations, loneliness, age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), residence quality, use of pornography, and sex-related online activities. Adolescents classified into different clusters significantly differed in personality traits, loneliness, age, SES, use of pornography, and sex-related online activities. Specifically, individuals with CSB had external locus of control, anxious attachment, greater loneliness, higher frequency of pornography use, and more sex-related online activities than the other groups.

Exposure to stress and trauma can result in neurocognitive deficits via activation of neurological and other biological mechanisms. PLWH (n = 122) and persons without HIV (n = 95), 35-65 years of age, completed four questionnaires that were used to generate a trauma, economic hardship (food insecurity and low socioeconomic status), and stress composite variable (TES). Participants also completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and standardized self-reports of activities of daily living (ADLs). We examined the independent and interactive effects of TES and HIV status on neurocognitive performance and ADL declines. PLWH had more traumatic events, more food insecurity, lower socioeconomic status, and higher perceived stress compared with HIV- individuals (all ps &lt; .0001). Among PLWH, a higher composite TES score was associated with worse executive functioning (p = .02), worse learning (p = .02), worse working memory (p = .02), and more ADL declines (p &lt; .0001), even after controlling for relevant demographic, psychiatric, substance use, and HIV disease covariates. On their own, individual TES components did not predict these outcomes. Conversely, no significant relationships were observed between TES and cognitive domains nor ADL declines among HIV- individuals. A composite score of trauma, economic hardship, and stress was significantly associated with worse neurocognitive performance and functional declines among PLWH. These adverse experiences may contribute to neurocognitive and daily functioning difficulties commonly observed among PLWH. Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate the relationships between economic/psychosocial adversities and cognitive/functional outcomes over time, and examine potential mediators, such as inflammatory biomarkers.

Since C-fiber activation by a high-frequency subcutaneous electrical stimulation (SES) protocol causes spinal release of BDNF and induces spinal cord LTP, we propose that application of such protocol would be a sufficient condition for generating long-lasting BDNF-mediated central sensitization. Results showed that application of burst-like SES to rat toes produced (i) rapid induction of hyperalgesia that lasted for more than 3 weeks, (ii) early increase of C-reflex activity followed by increased wind-up scores lasting for more than 1 week, and (iii) early increase followed by late decrease in BDNF protein levels and phosphorylated TrkB that lasted for more than 1 week. These changes were prevented by the TrkB antagonist cyclotraxin-B administered shortly before SES, while hyperalgesia was reversed by cyclotraxin-B administered 3 days after SES. Results suggest that mechanisms underlying central sensitization first involve BDNF release of probably neuronal origin, followed by brief increased expression of likely glial BDNF and pTrkB that could switch early phase sensitization into late one.",2018,1,1,"Frontiers in pharmacology","10.3389/fphar.2018.01143","PMC6191473","Front Pharmacol","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.brainresbull.2012.09.016; 10.1038/330649a0; 10.1113/jphysiol.1973.sp010273; 10.1371/journal.pone.0155001; 10.1371/journal.pone.0009777; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.19-18-07983.1999; 10.1016/j.brainresbull.2011.08.008; 10.1016/j.jpain.2012.03.008; 10.1186/ar2756; 10.1038/nature04223; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2014.06.030; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.22-17-07737.2002; 10.1016/j.nbd.2014.10.025; 10.1038/mt.2011.42; 10.1016/j.neuron.2015.04.007; 10.1152/jn.1994.72.1.194; 10.1038/srep33694; 10.1155/2013/429815; 10.1111/j.1469-7793.1997.031bi.x; 10.1002/glia.20786; 10.1016/j.jpain.2005.06.004; 10.1016/j.pain.2009.03.022; 10.1152/jn.1994.71.1.216; 10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80378-5; 10.1016/S0304-3959(96)03222-8; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1222-03.2004; 10.1016/j.jpain.2009.06.012; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.21-12-04469.2001; 10.1007/s11064-017-2274-0; 10.1177/1744806916641679; 10.1186/s12974-015-0371-z; 10.1073/pnas.96.16.9385; 10.1002/ejp.1075; 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2015.07.026; 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2008.04.004; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.23-03-01026.2003; 10.1038/nrn2738; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.03.045; 10.1016/j.pain.2012.02.006; 10.1111/jnc.13676; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.13-12-05228.1993; 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2005.04392.x; 10.1152/physrev.00025.2008; 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2004.03656.x; 10.1155/2013/753656; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5714-08.2009; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3360-15.2016; 10.1016/j.bbi.2009.12.007; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.06-05-01433.1986; 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.12.139; 10.1159/000363036; 10.1016/j.bbi.2006.11.003",NA,"Laboratory of Neurobiology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Chemistry and Biology, University of Santiago de Chile, Santiago, Chile."
"30344492","Childhood Brain Development, the Educational Achievement Gap, and Cognitive Enhancement.","Fabrice Jotterand","Research on the effects of adversity on the brain of children initially encountered strong skepticism mainly due to the fear of stigmatization and the potential pathologizing of poverty as a disease. Despite initial resistance, an increasing body of work demonstrates a correlation between low socioeconomic status and brain development. This article will focus specifically on the impact of poverty (material, economic, and social) on childhood brain development and educational achievement. Some suggest that the use of cognitive enhancers in healthy students is perfectly acceptable and should be promoted to counterbalance the failure of traditional means to improve educational achievements. In this article, I critically assess the claim that a broad use of cognitive enhancers should be promoted and offer an alternative approach. The first section evaluates the neuroscientific facts and evidence of the impact of poverty on brain development and outlines some of the criticisms raised against the ""neuroscience of poverty."" The second section focuses on the proposal made by Ray (2016) that promotes the use of cognitive enhancers as a means to address poor educational attainment. I criticize the basis of her argument and propose a different approach I call the clinical ideal. Subsequently, I provide some ethical pointers to allow an ethical and prudent use of cognitive enhancers in the educational setting. The main point of the article is not to reject prima facie the use of cognitive enhancers in socially disadvantaged students but rather provide a more nuanced approach.",2018,1,1,"Frontiers in pharmacology","10.3389/fphar.2018.01142","PMC6182057","Front Pharmacol","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.7551/mitpress/9780262026635.001.0001; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.15081014; 10.1016/j.acap.2016.01.010; 10.1093/ije/dyr147; 10.3389/fnins.2014.00276; 10.1007/978-1-4020-8852-0_3; 10.1016/j.neuron.2017.08.034; 10.1038/nrn2897; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.1475; 10.1371/journal.pone.0018712; 10.1007/s12671-017-0716-z; 10.1371/journal.pone.0042486; 10.1016/B978-0-12-410529-4.00011-5; 10.1073/pnas.1522683112; 10.1111/desc.12096; 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00061; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.3139; 10.1093/ije/dyr215; 10.1038/nn.3983; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2005.00394.x; 10.1080/15265161.2016.1170231; 10.1111/desc.12686; 10.1080/21507740903508591; 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00579.x; 10.1037/a0028015; 10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00208",NA,"Center for Bioethics and Medical Humanities, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States."

Research into cognitive change after anaesthesia and surgery accelerated in the 1980s when multiple studies utilised detailed neuropsychological testing for assessment of cognitive change after cardiac surgery. This body of work consistently documented decline in cognitive function in elderly patients after anaesthesia and surgery, and cognitive changes have been identified up to 7.5 yr afterwards. Importantly, other studies have identified that the incidence of cognitive change is similar after non-cardiac surgery. Other than the inclusion of non-surgical control groups to calculate postoperative cognitive dysfunction, research into these cognitive changes in the perioperative period has been undertaken in isolation from cognitive studies in the general population. The aim of this work is to develop similar terminology to that used in cognitive classifications of the general population for use in investigations of cognitive changes after anaesthesia and surgery. A multispecialty working group followed a modified Delphi procedure with no prespecified number of rounds comprised of three face-to-face meetings followed by online editing of draft versions. Two major classification guidelines [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) and National Institute for Aging and the Alzheimer Association (NIA-AA)] are used outside of anaesthesia and surgery, and may be useful for inclusion of biomarkers in research. For clinical purposes, it is recommended to use the DSM-5 nomenclature. The working group recommends that 'perioperative neurocognitive disorders' be used as an overarching term for cognitive impairment identified in the preoperative or postoperative period. This includes cognitive decline diagnosed before operation (described as neurocognitive disorder); any form of acute event (postoperative delirium) and cognitive decline diagnosed up to 30 days after the procedure (delayed neurocognitive recovery) and up to 12 months (postoperative neurocognitive disorder).",2018,11,1,"British journal of anaesthesia","10.1016/j.bja.2017.11.087","PMC7069032","Br J Anaesth","eng","D000758; D003072; D039721; D000071257; D006801; D015994; D009483; D011183; D064266; D012107; D009626","Anesthesia; Cognition Disorders; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Emergence Delirium; Humans; Incidence; Neuropsychological Tests; Postoperative Complications; Preexisting Condition Coverage; Research Design; Terminology as Topic","K76 AG057022","NA","The authors L.E., R.G.E., D.S.K., D.A.S., B.S., E.S.O., D.A., A.B., D.B., S.G.D., D.v.D., M.F.E., D.G., K.H., S.I., E.M., P.M., B.A.O., T.O., C.P., P.S., K.S., F.E.S., J.S., N.T., P.T., R.W., and Z.X. declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

Adult outpatient services in 36 primary healthcare facilities in Sodo District, Ethiopia (9 facilities); Sehore District, India (3); Chitwan District, Nepal (8); Dr Kenneth Kaunda District, South Africa (3); and Kamuli District, Uganda (13). Between 760 and 1893 adults were screened in each district. Across five districts, between 4.2% and 20.1% screened positive for depression and between 1.2% and 16.4% screened positive for AUD. 96% of screen-positive participants provided details about their clinical consultations that day. Detection of depression, treatment initiation for depression, detection of AUD and treatment initiation for AUD. Among depression screen-positive participants, clinical detection of depression ranged from 0% in India to 11.7% in Nepal. Small proportions of screen-positive participants received treatment (0% in Ethiopia, India and South Africa to 4.2% in Uganda).

Children from families of lower socioeconomic status (SES) tend to have poorer reading performance and this gap widens across years of schooling. Reading relies on the orchestration of multiple neural systems integrated via specific white-matter pathways, but there is limited understanding about whether these pathways relate differentially to reading performance depending on SES background. Kindergarten white-matter FA and second-grade reading outcomes were investigated in an SES-diverse sample of 125 children. The three left-hemisphere white-matter tracts most associated with reading, and their right-hemisphere homologs, were examined: arcuate fasciculus (AF), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). There was a significant and positive association between SES and fractional anisotropy (FA) in the bilateral ILF in kindergarten. SES moderated the association between kindergarten ILF and second grade reading performance, such that it was positive in lower-SES children, but not significant in higher-SES children.

It presents an ideal risk-stratifying method for use in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). There are, however, no population-based studies investigating the associations between handgrip strength and depression in LMICs. We aimed to assess these associations among community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults using nationally representative data from six LMICs. Cross-sectional data on individuals aged&#x202f;&#x2265;&#x202f;50 years from the World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health were analyzed. Depression was based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Weak handgrip strength was defined as&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;30&#x202f;kg for men and&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;20&#x202f;kg for women using the average value of two handgrip measurements of the dominant hand. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted. The sample included 34,129 individuals (62.4&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;16.0 years; 52.1% female). The prevalence of weak handgrip strength and depression were 47.4% and 6.2%, respectively. Individuals with weak handgrip strength had a higher prevalence of depression than those without this condition (8.8% vs. 3.8%; p&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;0.001). Across all countries, after adjustment for potential confounders, weak handgrip strength was associated with a 1.45 (95%CI&#x202f;=&#x202f;1.12-1.88) times higher odds for depression, although some between-country differences were noted. Weaker handgrip strength is associated with higher odds for depression in LMICs. Future research should seek to establish the predictive value of this inexpensive measure for clinical use. Furthermore, interventional studies should examine if muscular strength can be a target of resistance-training interventions to address depressive symptoms in low-resourced settings.",2019,1,15,"Journal of affective disorders","10.1016/j.jad.2018.09.036",NA,"J Affect Disord","eng","D000293; D000328; D000367; D000368; D002681; D003430; D003863; D005260; D005869; D018737; D006801; D007182; D007194; D008297; D008800; D008875; D018908; D011203; D015995; D012426; D012737; D013019; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Ghana; Hand Strength; Humans; Income; India; Male; Mexico; Middle Aged; Muscle Weakness; Poverty; Prevalence; Russia; Sex Factors; South Africa; Young Adult","ICA-CL-2017-03-001","NA",NA,"KU Leuven Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Tervuursevest 101, Leuven 3001, Belgium; KU Leuven, University Psychiatric Center KU Leuven, Leuvensesteenweg 517, Kortenberg 3070, Belgium."

Knowledge regarding these factors would be beneficial in the development and implementation of effective preventive and management measures for affected patients. The authors conducted a study to gain a better understanding of these factors in a low-income setting. This prospective study was performed at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) in Uganda between January 2014 and June 2017. Patients of any age who presented and were diagnosed with CSDH during the aforementioned time period were included in the study. Variables were collected from patients' files at discharge and follow-up clinic visits. The primary outcome of interest was death. Secondary outcomes of interest included discharge Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, ICU admission, wound infection, and CSDH recurrence. Two hundred five patients, the majority of whom were male (147 [72.8%]), were enrolled in the study. The mean patient age was 60.2 years (SD 17.7). Most CSDHs occurred as a result of motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) and falls, 35.6% (73/205) and 24.9% (51/205), respectively. The sex ratio and mean age varied depending on the mechanism of injury. Headache was the most common presenting symptom (89.6%, 173/193), whereas seizures were uncommon (11.5%, 23/200). Presenting symptoms differed by age. A total of 202 patients underwent surgical intervention with burr holes and drainage, and 22.8% (46) were admitted to the ICU. Two patients suffered a recurrence, 5 developed a postoperative wound infection, and 18 died. Admission GCS score was a significant predictor of the discharge GCS score (p = 0.004), ICU admission (p &lt; 0.001), and death (p &lt; 0.001). Trauma from an MVC is the commonest cause of CSDH among the young. For the elderly, falling is common, but the majority have CSDH with no known cause. Although the clinical presentation is broad, there are several pronounced differences based on age. Burr hole surgery plus drainage is a safe and reliable intervention. A low preoperative GCS score is a risk factor for ICU admission and death.",2018,10,1,"Neurosurgical focus","10.3171/2018.7.FOCUS18253",NA,"Neurosurg Focus","eng","D000058; D000063; D000367; D000368; D003399; D019049; D004322; D005260; D015600; D006261; D020200; D006801; D008297; D008875; D011203; D011446; D017678; D016896; D014454","Accidental Falls; Accidents, Traffic; Age Factors; Aged; Craniotomy; Developed Countries; Drainage; Female; Glasgow Coma Scale; Headache; Hematoma, Subdural, Chronic; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Poverty; Prospective Studies; Sex Distribution; Treatment Outcome; Uganda",NA,"NA",NA,"4Duke University Division of Global Neurosurgery and Neuroscience."

Children from diverse ethnic backgrounds (Caucasian, African American, Asian, Latino, other, or multiethnic) were followed across the course of the kindergarten year. Parents reported on SES and parenting. A nurse completed 13 physical exams per child over the year to assess FIs and URIs. During the school year, 28% of children (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;199, 56% ethnic minority) exhibited one or more FIs (range, 0-6) and 90% exhibited one or more URIs (range, 0-10). No main or moderating effects of SES or restrictive parenting on FIs or URIs were found among Caucasian children; however, among ethnic minority children, the relation of SES to FIs was conditional upon restrictive parenting (&#x3b2;&#x202f;=&#x202f;.66; P&#x202f;=&#x202f;.02), as the fewest FIs were found for lower SES minority children whose parents reported more restrictive practices. Additionally, among minority children, more restrictive parenting was marginally associated with fewer URIs (&#x3b2;&#x202f;=&#x202f;-.21; P&#x202f;=&#x202f;.05). Unexpectedly, among minority children the fewest illnesses occurred among lower SES children whose parents endorsed more restrictive parenting. This may be due to unique appraisals of this rearing style among minority children in lower SES environments and its potential to influence immune functioning.

The aim of this study is to investigate the potential impact of deprivation and urban/rural areas on capability to live well with dementia and to examine whether availability of informal carers modified the associations. The analysis was based on a large cohort study of 1547 community-dwelling people with dementia across Great Britain. Quality of life, life satisfaction, and well-being were measured as indices of ""living well."" Multivariate modelling was used to investigate differences in living well measures across deprivation quintiles and urban/rural areas adjusting for sociodemographic factors and number of comorbidities and stratifying by three groups: those living with a carer, those with a noncoresident carer and those without a carer. Negative dose-response relationships between deprivation and measures of quality of life (-2.12; 95% CI: -3.52, -0.73), life satisfaction (-1.27; 95% CI: -2.70, 0.16), and well-being (-5.24; 95% CI: -10.11, -0.36) were found in participants living with a carer. The associations were less clear in those with a noncoresident carer and those without a carer but these two groups generally reported lower scores on living well indicators than participants living with a carer.

The socioeconomic literature successfully identified the major role of socioeconomic status of parents, both as a direct and indirect effect, in the shaping and intergenerational reproduction of wealth and health. Furthermore, the importance of cognitive abilities as actor in this process has been widely studied in socioeconomic literature. A third factor that has been identified by the socioeconomic discipline is the so-called non-cognitive capabilities. This category, however, lacks a clear definition and seems to be a catchall for a collection of factors. Within the repository of these non-cognitive capabilities the construct of executive functions is an interesting and important contribution from cognitive neuroscience. The multidimensional construct of executive functioning or cognitive control (i.e. planning and formulation of objectives) and monitoring processes (i.e. influences the execution of these goals) is a valuable addition to a framework on reproduction of wealth and health over generations, because executive functions are sensitive to training.

Data came from the Family Life Project, which is a prospective longitudinal study of 1,292 children and families followed from birth in primarily low-income, non-urban counties in Pennsylvania (PA) and North Carolina (NC). Autoregressive cross-lagged mediation analyses indicated that EF at 58 months through EF at G1 mediated negative associations between cumulative risk exposure and academic skills, with this pathway mediating 36% of the total effect. Furthermore, social competence at K through EF at G1 mediated negative associations between early-life cumulative socioeconomic risk and academic skills, mediating 16% of the total effect. These findings provide evidence that poverty-related risks can influence school readiness and academic achievement via EF. Additionally, these results provide preliminary support for the premise that social competence through EF is a pathway by which cumulative poverty-related risk predicts early academic competence. Our findings are consistent with studies demonstrating developmental associations between EF and social competence. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with prekindergarten programs for children in poverty that emphasize both cognitive and social aspects of self-regulation.",2018,1,1,"Frontiers in psychology","10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01544","PMC6122065","Front Psychol","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.biopsych.2004.08.019; 10.1016/j.appdev.2016.05.004; 10.1037/0022-3514.88.4.589; 10.1037/0022-3514.83.4.817; 10.1002/cd.233; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01227.x; 10.1037/0003-066X.57.2.111; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01643.x; 10.1146/annurev-psych-010814-015221; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01019.x; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2009.06.001; 10.1037/0012-1649.36.6.793; 10.1207/s15327922par0601_4; 10.1002/cd.237; 10.1155/2017/5843851; 10.1007/s10802-006-9094-z; 10.1111/cdev.12129; 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.02.006; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01206.x.; 10.1007/s10802-015-0053-4; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.05.025; 10.1080/03004430.2012.682728; 10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143750; 10.1126/science.1204529; 10.1006/nimg.2002.1074; 10.1016/j.jped.2016.01.007; 10.1037/1045-3830.23.4.474; 10.1196/annals.1425.023; 10.1111/1467-8721.00160; 10.1037/a0031808; 10.1038/nrn2897; 10.1007/s10802-015-0044-5; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2007.05.002; 10.1037/0012-1649.43.6.1447; 10.1080/87565640903325691; 10.1002/cd.234; 10.1080/09297049.2010.535654; 10.1207/S15326942DN2003_2; 10.1177/019874290002600104; 10.1162/jocn.2009.21101; 10.1207/S15326942DN2101_2; 10.1016/j.appdev.2006.10.001; 10.1002/cd.232; 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01783; 10.1073/pnas.211415698; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2006.09.003; 10.1002/imhj.20296; 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00388; 10.1016/j.jsp.2005.01.003; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2013.07.005; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00600.x; 10.1016/j.appdev.2012.09.003; 10.1017/S095457941800007X; 10.1037/a0022658; 10.1037/a0028343; 10.1016/S0885-2006(97)90017-X; 10.1016/j.appdev.2008.12.012; 10.1076/chin.9.4.267.23513; 10.1016/j.appdev.2006.04.002; 10.1089/neu.2011.2144; 10.1016/j.jecp.2014.01.003; 10.1002/cad.20154; 10.1177/0956797617711640; 10.1037//1082-989X.7.4.422; 10.1007/s10567-010-0071-2; 10.1111/cdev.12386; 10.1080/10409289.2010.505259; 10.1037/0022-0663.100.1.67; 10.1007/s10802-015-0113-9; 10.1111/mono.12046; 10.1037/0022-0663.98.1.63; 10.1080/09297049.2011.554390; 10.1037/a0018708; 10.1037/a0025361; 10.1016/j.jecp.2010.04.007; 10.1037/a0025779",NA,"Neuroscience and Education Laboratory, Department of Applied Psychology, Institute of Human Development and Social Change, New York University, New York, NY, United States."

"30171780","Interindividual differences in neonatal sociality and emotionality predict juvenile social status in rhesus monkeys.","Lauren J Wooddell, Elizabeth A Simpson, Ashley M Murphy, Amanda M Dettmer, Annika Paukner","In humans, socioeconomic status (SES) has profound outcomes on socio-emotional development and health. However, while much is known about the consequences of SES, little research has examined the predictors of SES due to the longitudinal nature of such studies. We sought to explore whether interindividual differences in neonatal sociality, temperament, and early social experiences predicted juvenile social status in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), as a proxy for SES in humans. We performed neonatal imitation tests in infants' first week of life and emotional reactivity assessments at 2 and 4&#xa0;weeks of age. We examined whether these traits, as well as the rearing environment in the first 8&#xa0;months of life (with the mother or with same-aged peers only) and maternal social status predicted juvenile (2-3&#xa0;years old) social status following the formation of peer social groups at 8&#xa0;months. We found that infants who exhibited higher rates of neonatal imitation and newborn emotional reactivity achieved higher social status as juveniles, as did infants who were reared with their mothers, compared to infants reared with peers. Maternal social status was only associated with juvenile status for infant dyads reared in the same maternal group, indicating that relative social relationships were transferred through social experience. These results suggest that neonatal imitation and emotional reactivity may reflect ingrained predispositions toward sociality that predict later outcomes, and that nonnormative social experiences can alter socio-developmental trajectories. Our results indicate that neonatal characteristics and early social experiences predict later social outcomes in adolescence, including gradients of social stratification.",2019,3,1,"Developmental science","10.1111/desc.12749","PMC10519424","Dev Sci","eng","D000293; D000818; D004644; D005260; D006801; D007100; D007206; D007223; D007231; D008253; D008297; D009035; D010379; D012923; D012931","Adolescent; Animals; Emotions; Female; Humans; Imitative Behavior; Individuality; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Macaca mulatta; Male; Mothers; Peer Group; Social Class; Social Environment","ZIA HD001106; ZIA HD001107","10.1006/anbe.2000.1571; 10.1007/s00265-004-0870-x; 10.1002/ajp.22443; 10.1002/(ISSN)1098-2302; 10.1007/BF02735595; 10.1163/1568539X-00003241; 10.1016/j.cub.2015.10.016; 10.1111/cdev.12367; 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233; 10.1002/(ISSN)1098-2345; 10.1371/journal.pone.0110307; 10.1037/0022-3514.78.1.158; 10.1016/j.conb.2010.08.006; 10.1002/dev.20613; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2010.04.006; 10.1038/ncomms11940; 10.1002/dev.21285; 10.1007/BF02547673; 10.1001/jama.286.24.3089; 10.1016/j.neuron.2017.08.034; 10.1371/journal.pone.0145956; 10.1016/j.cub.2009.08.055; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2009.01316.x; 10.1371/journal.pbio.0040302; 10.1038/nrn2897; 10.1016/0163-6383(89)90029-5; 10.1111/j.1467-9450.1989.tb01072.x; 10.2105/AJPH.87.2.249; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.1989.tb00770.x; 10.1006/drev.1997.0447; 10.1016/j.physbeh.2007.11.042; 10.1006/jhev.1997.0140; 10.1037/0021-843X.108.3.490; 10.1038/srep34997; 10.1016/j.cub.2012.08.045; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08112.x; 10.1007/BF01813699; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.09.005; 10.1080/01650250244000137; 10.1080/01650250050118295; 10.1080/17470919.2015.1013223; 10.1037/0012-1649.35.1.189; 10.1177/0898264315585504; 10.1016/0140-6736(91)93068-K; 10.1136/jech.32.4.244; 10.1016/S0140-6736(84)92337-7; 10.1073/pnas.1113194109; 10.1111/cdev.12640; 10.1037/0012-1649.21.3.486; 10.1073/pnas.1423363112; 10.1037/0003-066X.53.2.185; 10.1126/science.198.4312.75; 10.1002/dev.21421; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2004.00364.x; 10.1002/icd.683; 10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.07.016; 10.1038/nn.3983; 10.1002/dev.21434; 10.1111/desc.12207; 10.1002/dev.21579; 10.1037/0012-1649.29.6.998; 10.1163/1568539X-00003418; 10.1002/ajpa.23286; 10.1073/pnas.1514879113; 10.1111/cdep.12235; 10.1037/0012-1649.23.2.216; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.12.016; 10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00047.x; 10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.06.012; 10.1163/156853996X00549; 10.1146/annurev.anthro.33.070203.144000; 10.1126/science.1106477; 10.1038/srep20233; 10.1098/rstb.2013.0289; 10.1371/journal.pone.0082921; 10.1002/dev.21146; 10.1073/pnas.1402471111; 10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.10.033; 10.1017/S0033291710000279; 10.1002/ajp.22081; 10.1002/dev.20594; 10.1111/j.1651-2227.1992.tb12112.x; 10.1073/pnas.1202734109; 10.7717/peerj.2394; 10.1159/000381538; 10.1016/j.infbeh.2004.02.001; 10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.06.002; 10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.01.024; 10.1007/978-3-319-30872-2; 10.1002/dev.21555; 10.1037/0012-1649.25.2.257","CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT.

This study used deidentified aggregated data including 13&#x202f;812 location-years of vital registration data to generate estimates of levels and rates of death by age-sex-year-location. The proportion of suicides in which a firearm was the lethal means was combined with an estimate of per capita gun ownership in a revised proxy measure used to evaluate the relationship between availability or access to firearms and firearm injury deaths. Firearm ownership and access. Cause-specific deaths by age, sex, location, and year. Worldwide, it was estimated that 251&#x202f;000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 195&#x202f;000-276&#x202f;000) people died from firearm injuries in 2016, with 6 countries (Brazil, United States, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and Guatemala) accounting for 50.5% (95% UI, 42.2%-54.8%) of those deaths.

Globally, the majority of firearm injury deaths in 2016 were homicides (64.0% [95% UI, 54.2%-68.0%]; absolute value, 161&#x202f;000 deaths [95% UI, 107&#x202f;000-182&#x202f;000]); additionally, 27% were firearm suicide deaths (67&#x202f;500 [95% UI, 55&#x202f;400-84&#x202f;100]) and 9% were unintentional firearm deaths (23&#x202f;000 [95% UI, 18&#x202f;200-24&#x202f;800]). From 1990 to 2016, there was no significant decrease in the estimated global age-standardized firearm homicide rate (-0.2% [95% UI, -0.8% to 0.2%]). Firearm suicide rates decreased globally at an annualized rate of 1.6% (95% UI, 1.1-2.0), but in 124 of 195 countries and territories included in this study, these levels were either constant or significant increases were estimated. There was an annualized decrease of 0.9% (95% UI, 0.5%-1.3%) in the global rate of age-standardized firearm deaths from 1990 to 2016. Aggregate firearm injury deaths in 2016 were highest among persons aged 20 to 24 years (for men, an estimated 34&#x202f;700 deaths [95% UI, 24&#x202f;900-39&#x202f;700] and for women, an estimated 3580 deaths [95% UI, 2810-4210]).

"30157796","Suicide in a rural area of coastal Kenya.","Mary A Bitta, Ioannis Bakolis, Symon M Kariuki, Gideon Nyutu, George Mochama, Graham Thornicroft, Charles R J C Newton","Suicide accounts for approximately 1.4% of deaths globally and is the 15th leading cause of death overall. There are no reliable data on the epidemiology of completed suicide in rural areas of many developing countries, yet suicide is an indicator of the sustainable development goals on health. Using data collected between 2008 and 2016 from the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System in rural Kenya, we retrospectively determined the incidence rate and risk factors for completed suicide. During the period, 104 people died by suicide, contributing to 0.78% (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.74-1.10) of all deaths. The mean annual incidence rate of suicide was 4.61 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.80-5.58) per 100,000 person years of observation (pyo). The annual incidence rate for men was higher than that of women (IRR&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.05, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.98-4.70, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and it increased with age (IRR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.73, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.30-3.24, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). People aged &gt;&#x2009;64&#xa0;years had the highest mean incidence rate of 18.58 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;11.99-28.80) per 100,000 pyo. Completed suicide was associated with age, being male, and living in a house whose wall is made of scrap material, which is a proxy marker of extreme poverty in this region (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.5, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.0-7.0, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). Most cases (76%) completed suicide by hanging themselves. Spatial heterogeneity of rates of suicides was observed across the enumeration zones of the KHDSS. Suicide is common in this area, but the incidence of completed suicide in rural Kenya may be an underestimate of the true burden. Like in other studies, suicide was associated with older age, being male and poverty, but other medical and neuropsychiatric risk factors should be investigated in future studies.",2018,8,29,"BMC psychiatry","10.1186/s12888-018-1855-z","PMC6114840","BMC Psychiatry","eng","D000328; D017677; D000368; D002423; D005260; D006801; D015994; D007630; D008297; D008875; D012189; D012307; D012424; D017678; D012737; D013405","Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Cause of Death; Female; Humans; Incidence; Kenya; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Sex Distribution; Sex Factors; Suicide","MR/S001255/1","10.1177/014107680509801011; 10.1016/j.rcp.2016.03.006; 10.1521/pedi_2016_30_241; 10.1186/s12889-015-2089-3; 10.1093/oxfordjournals.epirev.a036308; 10.1093/ije/dys062; 10.3402/gha.v6i0.21518; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001711; 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00234-2; 10.1017/S1041610295001931; 10.1111/j.1365-2214.2010.01124.x; 10.1186/s12889-016-2854-y; 10.1186/s12863-017-0538-y; 10.1192/bjp.bp.109.076349; 10.1186/s13033-017-0135-5; 10.1001/archpsyc.1995.03950190076011; 10.1176/appi.ajp.162.11.2116; 10.1192/bjp.171.4.355; 10.1016/S2215-0366(16)30066-9; 10.3402/gha.v7.25593","ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Permission to use data from the KHDSS was granted by the Scientific Ethics and Review Unit of the Kenya Medical Research Institute under protocol number 038/3260.

"30140675","Syndrome Evaluation System for Simultaneous Detection Pathogens Causing Acute Encephalitic Syndrome in India, Part-1: Development and Standardization of the Assay.","Sunil Govekar, Siddharth Anand, Latha P Lakshman, Ravi Vasanthapuram, Ravikumar V Banda","A large number of organisms are known to cause acute encephalitic syndrome (AES). A number of diagnostic tests have to be performed in order to arrive at a probable pathogen causing AES thus making it a very time consuming, laborious and expensive. The problem is further compounded by the lack of availability of sufficient volume of Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Thus, there is an urgent need of a diagnostic tool for the simultaneous detection of all probable pathogens responsible for causing AES. Here we report the development of a novel diagnostic method, Syndrome Evaluation System (SES) for the simultaneous detection of 22 pathogens including RNA and DNA Viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasite all endemic to India and Southeast Asia in a single sample using a novel multiplexing strategy. Syndrome Evaluation System (SES) involves isolation of nucleic acid, multiplex amplification of the DNA, and cDNA followed by identification of the amplified product by sequence specific hybridization on SES platform with the final read out being a visually recordable colored signal. The total time required to carry out this diagnostic procedure is 7 h. The SES was standardized using the commercially available vaccines, panels and cell culture grown quantified viruses/bacteria/fungi. The limit of detection (LOD) of SES ranged between 0.1 and 50 viral particles per ml of CSF and 100 to 200 bacterial cells or 5 parasites per ml of CSF, along with 100% specificity. Precision studies carried out as per the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) guidelines, using two concentrations of each pathogen one the LOD and the other double the LOD, clearly demonstrated, that inter/intra assay variability was within the limits prescribed by the guidelines. SES is a rapid molecular diagnostic tool for simultaneous identification of 22 etiological agents of AES encountered both in sporadic and outbreak settings.",2018,1,1,"Frontiers in medicine","10.3389/fmed.2018.00208","PMC6094979","Front Med (Lausanne)","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1136/jnnp.2003.034280; 10.1017/S1481803500015876; 10.1128/CMR.17.4.903-925.2004; 10.1128/JCM.41.1.346-350.2003; 10.1002/1096-9071(200011)62:3&lt;349::AID-JMV7&gt;3.0.CO;2-L; 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703153; 10.1128/JCM.39.12.4426-4432.2001; 10.1128/JCM.43.8.4172-4174.2005; 10.1017/S0950268806007163; 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16982-1; 10.4269/ajtmh.2005.73.566; 10.1007/BF02724422; 10.1186/1743-422X-3-92; 10.1016/j.jns.2007.12.018; 10.4103/0255-0857.25175; 10.4103/0028-3886.51289; 10.3201/eid1202.051247; 10.3201/eid1502.080865; 10.1128/JCM.39.9.3056-3059.2001; 10.1128/JCM.00875-06; 10.1016/j.mcp.2011.03.004; 10.1073/pnas.242579699",NA,"Research and Development, XCyton Diagnostics Limited, Bangalore, India."
"30134908","A systematic review of frameworks for the interrelationships of mental health evidence and policy in low- and middle-income countries.","Nicole Votruba, Alexandra Ziemann, Jonathan Grant, Graham Thornicroft","The interrelationships between research evidence and policy-making are complex. Different theoretical frameworks exist to explain general evidence-policy interactions. One largely unexplored element of these interrelationships is how evidence interrelates with, and influences, policy/political agenda-setting. This review aims to identify the elements and processes of theories, frameworks and models on interrelationships of research evidence and health policy-making, with a focus on actionability and agenda-setting in the context of mental health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). A systematic review of theories was conducted based on the BeHeMOTh search method, using a tested and refined search strategy. Nine electronic databases and other relevant sources were searched for peer-reviewed and grey literature. Two reviewers screened the abstracts, reviewed full-text articles, extracted data and performed quality assessments. Analysis was based on a thematic analysis. The included papers had to present an actionable theoretical framework/model on evidence and policy interrelationships, such as knowledge translation or evidence-based policy, specifically target the agenda-setting process, focus on mental health, be from LMICs and published in English. From 236 publications included in the full text analysis, no studies fully complied with our inclusion criteria. Widening the focus by leaving out 'agenda-setting', we included ten studies, four of which had unique conceptual frameworks focusing on mental health and LMICs but not agenda-setting. The four analysed frameworks confirmed research gaps from LMICs and mental health, and a lack of focus on agenda-setting. Frameworks and models from other health and policy areas provide interesting conceptual approaches and lessons with regards to agenda-setting. Our systematic review identified frameworks on evidence and policy interrelations that differ in their elements and processes. No framework fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Four actionable frameworks are applicable to mental health and LMICs, but none specifically target agenda-setting. We have identified agenda-setting as a research theory gap in the context of mental health knowledge translation in LMICs. Frameworks from other health/policy areas could offer lessons on agenda-setting and new approaches for creating policy impact for mental health and to tackle the translational gap in LMICs.",2018,8,22,"Health research policy and systems","10.1186/s12961-018-0357-2","PMC6106735","Health Res Policy Syst","eng","D003695; D003906; D019317; D006291; D006801; D007182; D001523; D008603; D008605; D011050; D011203; D057170","Delivery of Health Care; Developing Countries; Evidence-Based Medicine; Health Policy; Humans; Income; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Policy Making; Poverty; Translational Research, Biomedical","MR/S001255/1; R01 MH100470; ES/J500057/1","10.1186/1748-5908-7-50; 10.1002/wps.20133; 10.1177/070674370805300501; 10.1002/chp.55; 10.1007/s11920-017-0780-z; 10.1186/1478-4505-12-2; 10.1332/174426416X14609261565901; 10.1186/1472-6963-14-2; 10.1258/jrsm.2011.110180; 10.1186/1478-4505-13-1; 10.1186/s12961-017-0247-z; 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2006.03775.x; 10.1002/chp.47; 10.1111/j.1741-6787.2004.t01-1-04009.x; 10.1111/j.1468-0009.2007.00506.x; 10.1186/s12961-018-0284-2; 10.1186/1478-4505-12-34; 10.15171/ijhpm.2015.10; 10.1258/jrsm.2011.110285; 10.1111/j.1468-0009.2011.00643.x; 10.2307/3109916; 10.1186/1478-4505-11-30; 10.1332/147084414X13988707323088; 10.1371/journal.pone.0077404; 10.1186/s12961-015-0013-z; 10.1111/1468-0009.12026; 10.1332/174426514X672380; 10.1186/1478-4505-6-12; 10.1002/jid.1235; 10.1186/s12961-015-0016-9; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.04.020; 10.1093/heapol/czn019; 10.1177/0141076814530600; 10.1186/1478-4505-7-26; 10.1093/bmb/ldm010; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61241-0; 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61817-6; 10.1017/S2045796015000359; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61263-X; 10.3109/10673229.2012.649117; 10.1192/bjp.bp.108.050187; 10.1016/j.aogh.2014.04.014; 10.1017/gmh.2016.20; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00727.x; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.01.033; 10.1258/135581902320432778; 10.1176/appi.ps.201400329; 10.1332/174426413X662671; 10.1332/174426409X463811; 10.1186/s13012-015-0351-9; 10.1093/heapol/9.4.353; 10.1186/1478-4505-1-2; 10.1186/1478-4505-12-55; 10.1186/s12961-017-0192-x; 10.1186/1472-6963-12-200; 10.1017/S2045796017000452; 10.3109/09638237.2014.976857; 10.1111/1468-0009.00005; 10.1093/heapol/czu081; 10.2196/publichealth.5014; 10.1111/j.1541-0072.2009.00345.x; 10.1186/1472-6963-9-43; 10.1016/0168-8510(95)00728-B; 10.1093/heapol/czq078; 10.2471/BLT.06.030593; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005431; 10.1111/hir.12108; 10.1016/j.ijsu.2010.02.007; 10.1186/1471-2288-11-29; 10.1186/s13012-015-0242-0; 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2004.09.002; 10.1136/bmj.b2700; 10.1186/1472-6947-7-16; 10.1177/1049732312452938; 10.1186/1471-2288-6-35; 10.1080/09614520500450925; 10.2471/BLT.05.027789; 10.2471/BLT.06.030312; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.05.009; 10.1186/s12961-015-0018-7; 10.1111/1468-0009.t01-1-00052; 10.1186/s12961-015-0029-4; 10.1186/1471-2458-7-309; 10.1186/s12992-016-0209-1; 10.1186/1748-5908-8-44; 10.1186/s12961-017-0264-y; 10.1016/j.ijid.2015.10.024; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61579-7; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.06.016; 10.7870/cjcmh-2017-022; 10.1258/135581903322405126; 10.1111/j.1475-6773.2009.00958.x; 10.1186/s13012-016-0496-1; 10.1186/1478-4505-7-30; 10.1016/j.puhe.2014.02.004; 10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00583.x; 10.1186/s13012-017-0642-4; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.01.034; 10.1046/j.1365-3156.1999.00497.x; 10.1016/j.healthpol.2006.03.006; 10.1080/14623730.2017.1326398; 10.1080/j.1440-1665.2005.02187.x; 10.1038/nature16032; 10.1590/S0102-311X2004000200023","ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Ethics approval for the wider study has been obtained from King&#x2019;s College London under KCL Ethics Ref: LRS-15/16&#x2013;2618.

"30134869","Factors associated with health service utilisation for common mental disorders: a systematic review.","Tessa Roberts, Georgina Miguel Esponda, Dzmitry Krupchanka, Rahul Shidhaye, Vikram Patel, Sujit Rathod","There is a large treatment gap for common mental disorders (CMD), with wide variation by world region. This review identifies factors associated with formal health service utilisation for CMD in the general adult population, and compares evidence from high-income countries (HIC) with that from low-and-middle-income countries (LMIC). We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE and Scopus in May 2016. Eligibility criteria were: published in English, in peer-reviewed journals; using population-based samples; employing standardised CMD measures; measuring use of formal health services for mental health reasons by people with CMD; testing the association between this outcome and any other factor(s). Risk of bias was assessed using the adapted Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. We synthesised the results using ""best fit framework synthesis"", with reference to the Andersen socio-behavioural model. Fifty two studies met inclusion criteria. 46 (88%) were from HIC. Predisposing factors: There was evidence linking increased likelihood of service use with female gender; Caucasian ethnicity; higher education levels; and being unmarried; although this was not consistent across all studies. Need factors: There was consistent evidence of an association between service utilisation and self-evaluated health status; duration of symptoms; disability; comorbidity; and panic symptoms. Associations with symptom severity were frequently but less consistently reported. Enabling factors: The evidence did not support an association with income or rural residence. Inconsistent evidence was found for associations between unemployment or having health insurance and use of services. There was a lack of research from LMIC and on contextual level factors. In HIC, failure to seek treatment for CMD is associated with less disabling symptoms and lack of perceived need for healthcare, consistent with suggestions that ""treatment gap"" statistics over-estimate unmet need for care as perceived by the target population. Economic factors and urban/rural residence appear to have little effect on treatment-seeking rates. Strategies to address potential healthcare inequities for men, ethnic minorities, the young and the elderly in HIC require further evaluation.

Arthritis was less likely among those with higher SES, regardless of CM history. CM has been associated with increased risk of adult-onset arthritis; however, little is known about whether socioeconomic status moderates arthritis risk in those with CM history. We investigated arthritis across education, income, and race/ethnicity and whether CM moderated associations between SES and arthritis. Data were drawn from Wave 2 (2004-2005) of the nationally representative (USA) National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;34,563; aged &#x2265;&#x2009;20&#xa0;years). Self-reported CM history included physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, emotional neglect, physical neglect, and exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV). We used descriptive statistics and logistic regression to determine relationships between SES, CM, and arthritis. Interaction terms were used to test if CM moderated relationships between SES and arthritis. Arthritis prevalence was 21.1% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3093) among men and 30.1% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;6167) among women. In unadjusted analyses, women (p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.001) and older age (both sexes, p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.01) were associated with increased odds of arthritis. All CM types were associated with increased odds of arthritis, except exposure to IPV among women. In sex-stratified, age-adjusted analyses, lower education and income, family dysfunction, being Hispanic or Asian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and &#x2265;&#x2009;1 physical comorbidity were associated with increased odds of arthritis among those with and without CM: trends were similar for both sexes. In age-adjusted two-way interaction terms, CM did not moderate associations between SES and arthritis. Although CM was associated with arthritis, associations between SES and arthritis were not amplified. Arthritis was less likely among those with higher SES, regardless of CM history.",2019,2,1,"Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA","10.1007/s00198-018-4671-x",NA,"Osteoporos Int","eng","D000328; D054523; D017677; D000368; D000369; D001168; D002648; D002649; D002908; D003430; D005260; D006306; D006801; D008297; D008875; D015995; D012307; D017678; D012923; D012959; D014481; D055815","Adult; Adult Survivors of Child Abuse; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arthritis; Child; Child Abuse; Chronic Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; Young Adult","1107510; N/A","NA",NA,"Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada."

Using a two-channel NIRS arrangement, we measured changes in bilateral prefrontal blood oxygenation during a category version of the verbal fluency task (VFT) in 27 monozygotic twin pairs and 12 same-sex dizygotic twin pairs ages 5-17&#xa0;years. We also assessed the participant's full-scale intelligence quotient (FIQ) and retrieved parental socioeconomic status (SES). Classical structured equation modeling was used to estimate the heritability. The heritability of VFT-related brain activation was estimated to be 44% and 37% in the right and left prefrontal regions, respectively. We also identified a significant genetic contribution (74%) to FIQ, but did not to VFT task performance. Parental SES was not correlated with FIQ, task performance, or task-related prefrontal activation. This finding provides further evidence that variance in prefrontal function has a genetic component since childhood and highlights brain function, as measured by NIRS, as a promising candidate for endophenotyping neurodevelopmental disorders.",2018,6,1,"Brain and behavior","10.1002/brb3.980","PMC5991600","Brain Behav","eng","D000293; D002648; D002675; D004777; D056344; D005260; D059907; D006801; D007361; D007564; D008297; D010101; D010108; D017397; D012923; D019265; D013647","Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Environment; Executive Function; Female; Functional Neuroimaging; Humans; Intelligence Tests; Japan; Male; Oxygen Consumption; Oxyhemoglobins; Prefrontal Cortex; Social Class; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared; Task Performance and Analysis",NA,"10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.12.040; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2008.03.006; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5334-10.2011; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.02.027; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2007.11.011; 10.1037/0096-3445.137.2.201; 10.1002/hbm.22890; 10.1176/appi.ajp.160.4.636; 10.1038/nrn2897; 10.1037/0894-4105.18.2.284; 10.1016/S0361-9230(03)00066-2; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00843.x; 10.1097/WNR.0b013e32834e664c; 10.1007/s11065-015-9278-9; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.03.050; 10.1371/journal.pone.0025944; 10.1371/journal.pone.0006881; 10.1126/science.1167371; 10.1016/j.bbr.2006.05.020; 10.1177/0963721411429458; 10.1016/j.nicl.2015.06.011; 10.1007/978-94-015-8018-2; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.08.026; 10.1017/S0001566000005626; 10.1111/j.1440-1819.2005.01408.x; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.03.052; 10.1017/S1355617710001335; 10.1111/pcn.12291; 10.1006/nimg.2002.1227; 10.1038/nrg3240; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.05.126; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.10.043; 10.1046/j.0956-7976.2003.psci_1475.x",NA,"Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."

CR is associated with different outcomes in severe mental illness. This study aimed to analyze the impact of CR according to the diagnosis of first-episode affective or non-affective psychosis (FEP). A total of 247 FEP patients (211 non-affective and 36 affective) and 205 healthy controls were enrolled. To assess CR, common proxies have been integrated (premorbid IQ; education-occupation; leisure activities). The groups were divided into high and low CR. In non-affective patients, those with high CR were older, had higher socioeconomic status (SES), shorter duration of untreated psychosis, and a later age of onset. They also showed greater performance in most cognitive domains. In affective patients, those with a greater CR showed a higher SES, better functioning, and greater verbal memory performance. CR plays a differential role in the outcome of psychoses according to the diagnosis. Specifically, in order to address the needs of non-affective patients with low CR, cognitive rehabilitation treatments will need to be 'enriched' by adding pro-cognitive pharmacological agents or using more sophisticated approaches.

It also evaluates the differences between the development of spontaneous imitation and language skills in verbal and nonverbal children. New Reynell Developmental Language Scales (NRDLS) was administered to a sample of 60 children aged from 3 years to 5 years and 11 months, with apparently normal language development. The NRDLS were administered in a public nursery school in a poor area of Bari and to a private nursery school in the ""Noicattaro"" residential district, in order to differentiate SES. The NRDLS identified 19 nonverbal children and 41 verbal children. SES does not affect the process of language acquisition, although the mother's schooldegree improves the child's language capacity. Analysis of mean scores on the NRDLS imitation items revealed a statistically significant difference between the verbal and nonverbal group with more impairment/higher scores in nonverbal than the verbal group.

Formative work was undertaken previously to design a culturally appropriate CBR intervention for people with schizophrenia in Ethiopia. The current study explored the acceptability and feasibility of CBR in practice, as well as how CBR may improve functioning among people with schizophrenia. This mixed methods pilot study took place in rural Ethiopia between December 2014 and December 2015. Ten people with schizophrenia who were unresponsive to treatment with medication alone, and their caregivers, participated in CBR. CBR was led by lay workers with five weeks training and involved home visits (education, family intervention and support returning to work) and community mobilisation. Theory of change was used to guide the pilot evaluation. Qualitative and quantitative data&#xa0;were collected at baseline, six months and 12&#xa0;months. Forty in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions were conducted with 31 individuals comprising people with schizophrenia, caregivers, CBR workers, supervisors, health officers and community members. The RISE CBR intervention may have a positive impact on functioning through the pathways of enhanced family support, improved access to health care, increased income and improved self-esteem. CBR was acceptable to CBR workers, community leaders and health officers. Some CBR workers found it challenging to accept the choices of people with schizophrenia. These concerns were felt to be resolvable with supplementary training for CBR workers. The intervention was feasible but&#xa0;further evaluation is needed on a larger scale. In low and middle-income countries, CBR may be an acceptable and feasible adjuvant approach to facility-based care for people with schizophrenia. However, contextual factors, including poverty and inaccessible anti-psychotic medication, remain substantial challenges. There were indications that CBR can impact on functioning but the RISE trial will determine effectiveness.",2018,8,3,"BMC psychiatry","10.1186/s12888-018-1818-4","PMC6091097","BMC Psychiatry","eng","D000328; D017028; D003156; D005002; D005260; D017144; D006801; D007182; D008297; D008875; D010865; D011203; D012424; D012559; D012565; D011795; D013997","Adult; Caregivers; Community Mental Health Services; Ethiopia; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Income; Male; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Poverty; Rural Population; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors","MR/K012126/1; MR/M025470/1; 100142/Z/12/Z","10.1016/j.schres.2005.05.028; 10.1192/bjp.bp.105.020982; 10.1016/j.schres.2013.10.032; 10.1186/s12992-017-0273-1; 10.1192/bjp.bp.114.149112; 10.1186/s12888-015-0418-9; 10.1016/j.schres.2014.10.053; 10.1080/19439342.2016.1157623; 10.1186/s12888-017-1516-7; 10.1186/s12888-015-0400-6; 10.1371/journal.pone.0143572; 10.1186/s13063-016-1427-9; 10.1186/1745-6215-15-267; 10.1371/journal.pone.0126666; 10.1016/j.schres.2004.05.017; 10.1186/s12955-017-0647-3; 10.1016/S0920-9964(99)00088-2; 10.1001/archpsyc.1987.01800180050009; 10.1192/bjp.191.50.s7; 10.1186/s13012-016-0422-6; 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; 10.1093/heapol/czv072; 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61817-6; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1993.tb02093.x; 10.1016/j.jad.2015.07.015; 10.1177/1609406917733847; 10.1353/nas.2004.0018; 10.1186/2193-1801-3-189; 10.1186/1471-244X-13-168; 10.1186/s12939-017-0657-0","Ethical approval was obtained from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) Research Ethics Committee and the Addis Ababa University College of Health Sciences Institutional Review Board.

Cross-sectional surveys were disseminated via professional and family networks in 32 European countries for 3 months from December 2016. Families (n=731), of whom 45% met UNICEF criteria for severe poverty, and professionals (n=959) responded from 23 and 32 countries respectively. Respondents were grouped into those from countries with and without austerity. The direct and indirect impact of austerity cuts and worse working conditions were reported more often by professionals from countries with austerity, compared to those without. Most families reported services to be worse in quality than 3 years ago. Families with completely dependent disabled children said the needs of their disabled children are significantly less well met now, compared to 10 years ago. A decline in quality of services for disabled children was reported by most family and many professional respondents across Europe, regardless of austerity. Where implemented, austerity measures were reported to have impacted significantly on families with disabled children. What this paper adds Stigma about disability remains a challenge in many countries across Europe. Most families and many health care professionals reported worsening quality of services than 3 years ago, regardless of austerity. Austerity cuts are reported to have impacted especially negatively on families with dependent disabled children. <AbstractText Label=""OBJETIVO"">Describir el impacto que han tenido las medidas de austeridad en las familias con ni&#xf1;os con discapacidad en toda Europa y de los profesionales que les prestan servicios.

Recent findings suggest that this is also true of age-related dementias. Yet most common indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) say very little about the actual mechanisms at play in disease development. The present paper explores five work exposure characteristics, all of which have a clear social gradient, that could potentially shed further light on the relationship between SES and dementia. Specifically, it investigates whether these exposures could moderate the impact of a well-known genetic risk factor: the <i>APOE</i> &#x25b;4 allele. The empirical analyses are based on data from a Swedish population study (n = 1019). Main occupation was linked to The Job Exposure Matrix to estimate the individuals' exposure to the following work environment factors: <i>work control</i>, <i>support</i>, <i>psychological demands, physical demands</i> and <i>job hazards.</i> All analyses were conducted using binary logistic regression and focused specifically on gene-work exposure interactions. A significant main effect of <i>work control</i> on dementia risk was detected for males (OR = 0.68; p&lt; 0.05), but not for females. However, control was found to significantly moderate the effect of <i>APOE</i> &#x25b;4 in both genders, albeit in different ways. These findings do not only underscore the importance of considering interactions between social and genetic risk factors to better understanding multifactorial diseases such as dementia. They also propose that gender- and class-based inequities interact, and hence must be considered simultaneously, also in relation to this particular disease.",2018,8,1,"SSM - population health","10.1016/j.ssmph.2018.06.009","PMC6043817","SSM Popul Health","eng",NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Sociology and Work Science, University of Gothenburg, Box 720, 405 30 Gothenburg, Sweden."

In a cross-sectional study, adult participants &gt;70 years old (n = 79, age 77.1 &#xb1; 5.3 years) underwent comprehensive cognitive evaluation and CSF collection, which was assayed for markers of amyloid, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), neurodegeneration (neurofilament light protein [NFL] and total tau), synaptic dysfunction (neurogranin), and glial activation (chitinase-3-like protein 1 [YKL-40]). Participants were divided into 3 groups based on diagnosis and p-tau/&#x3b2;-amyloid<sub>42</sub> (A&#x3b2;<sub>42</sub>): those with low p-tau/A&#x3b2;<sub>42</sub> and unimpaired cognition were classified as controls (n = 25); those with high p-tau/A&#x3b2;<sub>42</sub> diagnosed with AD-dementia or AD-mild cognitive impairment were classified as AD-Dementia (n = 40); and those with high p-tau/A&#x3b2;<sub>42</sub> but unimpaired cognition were classified as mismatches (n = 14). A similar, secondary analysis was performed with no age exclusion criteria (n = 411). In both the primary and secondary analyses, biomarker levels between groups were compared with the use of analysis of covariance while controlling for age and demographic variables. Despite p-tau/A&#x3b2;<sub>42</sub> and A&#x3b2;<sub>42</sub>/A&#x3b2;<sub>40</sub> levels comparable to those of the AD-Dementia group, mismatches had significantly lower levels of NFL and total tau. While not significantly lower than the AD-Dementia group on YKL-40 and neurogranin, mismatches were also not significantly different from controls. These results provide evidence that, in the absence of significant neurodegenerative processes, individuals who harbor AD neuropathology may remain cognitively unimpaired.

The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with functional impairment in people with enduring SMD in a rural African setting. A cross-sectional study was conducted at the baseline of a health service intervention trial. A total of 324 participants were recruited from an existing community-ascertained cohort of people with SMD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;218), and attendees at the Butajira General Hospital psychiatric clinic (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;106). Inclusion criteria defined people with SMD who had ongoing need for care: those who were on psychotropic medication, currently symptomatic or had a relapse in the preceding 2&#xa0;years. The World Health Organization Disability Assessment schedule (WHODAS-2.0) and the Butajira Functioning Scale (BFS) were used to assess functional impairment. Multivariable negative binomial regression models were fitted to investigate the association between demographic, socio-economic and clinical characteristics, and functional impairment. Increasing age, being unmarried, rural residence, poorer socio-economic status, symptom severity, continuous course of illness, medication side effects, and internalized stigma were associated with functional impairment across self-reported and caregiver responses for both the WHODAS and the BFS. Diagnosis per se was not associated consistently with functional impairment. To optimize functioning in people with chronic SMD in this setting, services need to target residual symptoms, poverty, medication side effects, and internalized stigma. Testing the impact of community interventions to promote recovery will be useful.

While numerous studies in recent decades have focused on understanding the contextual, psychosocial, and biological mechanisms linking SES and health, the neural pathways that contribute to this relationship are currently underinvestigated. The present paper reviews and synthesizes the small number of published studies that have explored links between SES and health-relevant neural functioning. Specifically, current knowledge of the relationship between socioeconomic factors and neural systems that may be affected by low SES contexts, including those related to processing threat and stress, responding to reward, and engaging in emotion regulation, is reviewed. Gaps in our knowledge that could be filled by health neuroscience research are emphasized, in an effort to catalyze future studies in this area. Understanding the neural mechanisms linking SES and health is crucial for building comprehensive models of the pathways by which social inequalities become health inequalities and may help identify novel targets for intervention to prevent health disparities.

Infused, radiolabeled, somatostatin analog peptides target tumors that are killed by irradiation damage. The peptides, however, are also retained in kidneys due to glomerular filtration, and the administered doses must be limited to avoid kidney damage. The human radical scavenger and antioxidant, &#x3b1;<sub>1</sub>-microglobulin (A1M), has previously been shown to protect bystander tissue against irradiation damage and has pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties similar to somatostatin analogs. In this study, we have investigated if A1M can be used as a renal protective agent in PRRT. We describe nephroprotective effects of human recombinant A1M on the short- and long-term renal damage observed following lutetium 177 (<sup>177</sup>Lu)-DOTATATE (150&#x2009;MBq) exposure in BALB/c mice.

For common mental disorders the evidence is less convincing. This study explores whether these findings are mirrored in data on dispensing of antipsychotics and antidepressants. Health insurance data on dispensed medication among all adults living in the four largest Dutch cities were linked to demographic data from Statistics Netherlands. Dispensing of antipsychotics and antidepressants in 2013 was analyzed in relation to the proportion of the own ethnic group in the neighborhood. Higher own-group ethnic density was associated with lower dispensing of antipsychotics among the Moroccan-Dutch (N&#x202f;=&#x202f;115,455), after adjusting for age, gender, and SES of the neighborhood (OR<sub>adj</sub> for the highest vs. the lowest density quintile&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.72 [0.66-0.79]). However, this association vanished after adjustment for household composition (OR<sub>adj</sub>&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.93 [0.85-1.03]). Similar results were found for the Turkish-Dutch (N&#x202f;=&#x202f;105,460) (OR<sub>adj</sub>&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.86 [0.76-0.96] and 1.05 [0.94-1.18]).

For antidepressants, a negative association with own-group ethnic density was consistently found for those of Antillean origin (OR<sub>adj</sub>&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.62 [0.52-0.74]) only. These data on dispensing of psychomedication confirm the ethnic density hypothesis for psychosis alongside earlier equivocal findings for other mental disorders. The negative association between own-group ethnic density and dispensing of antipsychotics among the Moroccan- and Turkish-Dutch may be explained, at least in part, by a favourable household composition (i.e., living in a family) in high-density neighborhoods.",2018,8,1,"Social science &amp; medicine (1982)","10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.06.005",NA,"Soc Sci Med","eng","D000293; D000328; D000368; D000928; D014150; D054242; D005006; D005260; D006297; D006801; D016015; D008297; D008875; D009018; D009313; D009426; D011618; D013532; D014421","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antidepressive Agents; Antipsychotic Agents; Emigrants and Immigrants; Ethnicity; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Morocco; National Health Programs; Netherlands; Psychotic Disorders; Suriname; Turkey",NA,"NA",NA,"Rivierduinen, Institute for Mental Health Care, Sandifortdreef 19, 2333 ZZ, Leiden, the Netherlands; Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, School for Mental Health and Neuroscience MHeNS, Maastricht University, Universiteitssingel 40, 6229 ER, Maastricht, the Netherlands."
"35005374","Factors involved in patients' perceptions of self-improvement after chronic pain treatment.","Majidullah Shaikh, Eleni G Hapidou","Patients' self-reported levels of improvement after having attended a chronic pain management program can provide a subjective rating of how successful they perceive they were at accomplishing their goals in the program. Past studies have demonstrated that successful patients differ from less successful ones on several cognitive-behavioral factors such as coping strategies over physical characteristics such as pain intensity. This study explored factors that determine patients' perceptions of self-improvement after undergoing chronic pain treatment in a pain management program. Participants (<i>n</i>&#xa0;= 174) underwent a 4-week, interdisciplinary, multimodal, chronic pain management program at a hospital located in southern Ontario. Questionnaire packages that evaluate pain intensity, pain-related disability, emotional distress (e.g., depression, anxiety, catastrophizing), acceptance of pain (activity engagement and pain willingness), readiness to change, and use of adaptive or maladaptive coping strategies were completed by patients at admission and discharge. Participants were grouped into one of three categories depending on their rating of self-improvement on the Self-Evaluation Scale (SES). The groups were compared on the magnitude of change they reported on the variables mentioned above. Changes in emotional distress, general health, readiness to change, activity engagement, and adaptive coping strategies (e.g., task persistence, pacing, and seeking social support) were significantly associated with differences in ratings of self-improvement. This study provided insight into what patients value most when rating their self-improvement, which can then be used to facilitate increased patient success and satisfaction with treatment. <b>Contexte</b> : Le niveau d&#x2019;am&#xe9;lioration autod&#xe9;clar&#xe9; par les patients apr&#xe8;s avoir particip&#xe9; &#xe0; un programme de gestion de la douleur chronique peut fournir une &#xe9;valuation subjective du succ&#xe8;s qu&#x2019;ils per&#xe7;oivent avoir obtenu pour atteindre leurs objectifs dans le cadre de ce programme.

This research investigated the relationship between compliance with the PA recommendations of the World Health Organization and sleep problems in 38 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Cross-sectional, community-based data from the World Health Survey were analyzed. Adjusted logistic regression analyses were undertaken to explore the relationship between PA levels using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and self-reported sleep problems (such as difficulties falling asleep, waking up frequently during the night or waking up too early in the morning) in the last 30 days. Across 204,315 individuals (38.6&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;16.1 years; 49.3% males), the overall prevalence (95% CI) of low PA and sleep problems were 29.9% (29.1-30.8%) and 7.5% (7.2-7.9%), respectively.

Over the last 20&#x202f;years, many projects have been carried out by our group in the Chaco region, Plurinational State of Bolivia, with the aim of enhancing knowledge about epilepsy. However, the level of knowledge of epilepsy that nonmedical health workers have reached has never been assessed until now. The main objective of our study was to assess the level of knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards epilepsy among nonmedical health staff of the rural communities of the Chaco region in Bolivia. The study was conducted in three departments of Bolivia. The nonmedical health personnel were invited to participate in a training program. They answered a validated questionnaire to evaluate their knowledge and attitudes towards epilepsy before and after the courses. One hundred nineteen subjects [42 men (36.2%); mean age 29.3&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;1.1&#x202f;years] were interviewed among community health workers and nurses before the courses, demonstrating a very good level of knowledge regarding epilepsy and its causes. Only 55 health workers participated in the second training module, and their answer did not significantly differ from the baseline. Our study confirms the usefulness of continuous educational campaigns, especially directed to nonspecialist healthcare providers of rural communities of LMIC, as they may be the only persons responsible for providing healthcare to PWE in that setting. Moreover, the importance of the baseline assessment of KAP was highlighted in order to adapt the educational campaigns to the baseline level of knowledge found.",2018,8,1,"Epilepsy &amp; behavior : E&amp;B","10.1016/j.yebeh.2018.05.026",NA,"Epilepsy Behav","eng","D000328; D001838; D003151; D004827; D005260; D007722; D006282; D006801; D008297; D008875; D011203; D012424; D011795","Adult; Bolivia; Community Health Centers; Epilepsy; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Poverty; Rural Population; Surveys and Questionnaires",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences and Advanced Technologies ""G.F.

To date, much of the existing research dedicated to pediatric anxiety disorders has largely been examined in bioecological models of diathesis-stress using community samples. This study extends our understanding of children's differential responsiveness to familial adversity by examining the diathesis-stress interaction of cumulative risk and children's individual-level vulnerabilities (negative affectivity and coping efficacy) within a clinic-referred treatment study for pediatric anxiety disorders. A cumulative risk index assessing exposure to familial adversity (e.g., socioeconomic status [SES], parent psychiatric illness) and self-reported measures of children's negative affectivity and coping efficacy were each measured at the intake of a randomized controlled clinical trial for the treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;488; 7-17 years of age). Trajectories of interviewer-rated anxiety symptoms were assessed across 12 weeks of treatment at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12&#xa0;weeks. Consistent with models of temperamental risk for mental health problems, negative affectivity predicted higher anxiety symptoms at intake. A significant diathesis-stress interaction between cumulative risk and coping efficacy emerged, as high risk and perceptions of lower coping efficacy attenuated declines in anxiety across 12 weeks. These patterns did not differ across treatment conditions. The results indicate that for youth experiencing high levels of stress, additional treatment efforts targeting familial stressors and coping efficacy may be important in maximizing treatment outcomes.",2018,1,1,"Journal of clinical child and adolescent psychology : the official journal for the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, American Psychological Association, Division 53","10.1080/15374416.2018.1460848","PMC6289867","J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol","eng","D000223; D000293; D001008; D002648; D015928; D005195; D005260; D006801; D008297; D008603; D010290; D012307; D057566; D012923; D012959; D013315","Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Anxiety Disorders; Child; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Family Relations; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Parents; Risk Factors; Self Report; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress, Psychological","U01 MH064003; U01 MH064107; U01 MH064092; U01 MH064089; U01 MH064088; T32 MH073517; U01 MH063747","10.1037/a0031808; 10.1007/s11336-009-9135-y",NA,"a UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior , University of California Los Angeles."

Understanding and ameliorating the problems of low SES have long been goals of economics and sociology; in recent years, these have also become goals of neuroscience. However, opinion varies widely on the relevance of neuroscience to SES-related policy. The present article addresses the question of whether and how neuroscience can contribute to the development of social policy concerning poverty and the social and ethical risks inherent in trying. I argue that the neuroscience approach to SES-related policy has been both prematurely celebrated and peremptorily dismissed and that some of its possible social impacts have been viewed with excessive alarm. Neuroscience has already made modest contributions to SES-related policy, and its potential to have a more effective and beneficial influence can be expected to grow over the coming years.",2018,7,1,"Nature reviews.

This included Aksum School of Medicine situated in Aksum, a rural town in Northern Ethiopia. The new Innovative Medical Curriculum (NIMC) is a four-year programme designed by the Ethiopian Federal Ministries of Health and Education. The curriculum is designed to train biomedical science graduates to become doctors in 4&#xa0;years, with a focus on the healthcare needs of rural people living in poverty. This research was conducted at Aksum School of Medicine and included two hospitals (Aksum Referral Hospital and St Mary's District Hospital). This study focused on medical students during their clinical years across multiple specialities (61 Clerkship 1 students and 13 Clerkship 2 students). We used primarily qualitative research methods supplemented with quantitative measures. There were 3 stages of data collection over a 1&#xa0;month period, this included qualitative group interviews, direct observation of students in a clinical setting and direct observation of skills sessions followed by a questionnaire on the sessions. We analysed the data by reconstructing the student experience and comparing it with the NIMC. The proposed typical week set out in the NIMC tended to differ from the real clinical experience of these students. Through qualitative group interview and direct observation of teaching, the main theme that was consistent throughout was the lack of doctors with specialist postgraduate training. Clinical need often took priority over education. However, students enjoyed taking early responsibility and gaining practical experience. Through direct observation of skills sessions and short questionnaires, these sessions were highly valuable to the students and they felt confident in carrying out the taught procedures in the future. The combination of poorly resourced hospitals and lack of specialist doctors provides a challenging environment for medical students to learn. However, it is a unique clinical experience that is rarely seen in developed countries and facilitates the acquirement of skills from an early stage. Supervision and specialist input is fundamental in enabling students to learn and this is a key area that was lacking in the students' clinical experience.",2018,5,31,"BMC medical education","10.1186/s12909-018-1199-x","PMC5984342","BMC Med Educ","eng","D003479; D003880; D004501; D005002; D013502; D006176; D006780; D006801; D009774; D009885; D010820; D011204; D036301; D012423; D012577; D013337; D013997","Curriculum; Dermatology; Education, Medical; Ethiopia; General Surgery; Gynecology; Hospitals, Rural; Humans; Obstetrics; Ophthalmology; Physicians; Poverty Areas; Qualitative Research; Rural Health; Schools, Medical; Students, Medical; Time Factors",NA,"10.1046/j.1365-2923.2002.01327.x; 10.1111/j.1365-2923.1989.tb00885.x; 10.1097/00001888-199604000-00018; 10.1097/00001888-200403000-00017; 10.1046/j.1365-2923.2000.00513.x; 10.1046/j.1365-2923.2000.00758.x; 10.2147/AMEP.S97916; 10.1186/s12960-015-0048-9; 10.1001/jama.1983.03340060055026; 10.3109/01421599309006654; 10.1097/ACM.0000000000002003","AUTHORS&#x2019; INFORMATION: CM graduated from the University of St Andrews with a BSc [1st class] in Medicine, and completed her MBBS degree at Barts and the London School of Medicine.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between the time spent sedentary during waking hours and sleep problems in six low- and middle-income countries. Cross-sectional, community-based data from the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health survey were analysed. Adjusted logistic regression analyses were undertaken to explore the relationship between self-reported sleep problems (such as difficulties falling asleep, waking up frequently during the night or waking up too early in the morning) in the last 30&#xa0;days and self-reported sedentary time (categorized as &lt;4, 4 to &lt;8, 8 to &lt;11 or &#x2265;11&#xa0;hr/day).

A total of 229 participants were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive intraarticular facet injections with bupivacaine and steroid, medial branch blocks, or saline. Those with a positive 1-month outcome (a 2-point or more reduction in average pain score) and score higher than 3 (positive satisfaction) on a 5-point satisfaction scale were followed up to 6 months. Participants in the intraarticular and medial branch block groups with a positive diagnostic block (50% or more relief) who experienced a negative outcome proceeded to the second phase and underwent radiofrequency ablation, while all saline group individuals underwent ablation. Coprimary outcome measures were average reduction in numerical rating scale pain score 1 month after the facet or saline blocks, and average numerical rating scale pain score 3 months after ablation. Mean reduction in average numerical rating scale pain score at 1 month was 0.7 &#xb1; 1.6 in the intraarticular group, 0.7 &#xb1; 1.8 in the medial branch block group, and 0.7 &#xb1; 1.5 in the placebo group; P = 0.993. The proportions of positive blocks were higher in the intraarticular (54%) and medial branch (55%) groups than in the placebo group (30%; P = 0.01). Radiofrequency ablation was performed on 135 patients (45, 48, and 42 patients from the intraarticular, medial branch, and saline groups, respectively). The average numerical rating scale pain score at 3 months was 3.0 &#xb1; 2.0 in the intraarticular, 3.2 &#xb1; 2.5 in the medial branch, and 3.5 &#xb1; 1.9 in the control group (P = 0.493). At 3 months, the proportions of positive responders in the intraarticular, medial branch block, and placebo groups were 51%, 56%, and 24% for the intraarticular, medial branch, and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.005).

Almost 80% of children with health disorders lack the developmental skills to take full advantage of school-based education relative to 27% of children without a health disorder. In Canada, there is currently a dearth of nationally representative data on the social determinants of early childhood development for children with health disorders. Evidence from Canada and other countries indicate that poorer developmental outcomes in typically developing children are associated with lower socioeconomic status (SES). However, to date, it is not known whether this relationship is stronger among children with health disorders. The study's objectives are to estimate the prevalence and to investigate social determinants of developmental outcomes for young children with health disorders, using the Early Development Instrument (EDI). Study objectives will be achieved through three steps. First, using existing EDI data for 10 provinces and 2 territories collected from 2004 to 2015, we will investigate differences in developmental health outcomes among children with identified health disorders. Second, population-level EDI data will be linked with neighbourhood sociodemographic census data to explore associations between socioeconomic characteristics and rates of specific diagnoses among children aged 5-6 years, including trends over time. Third, for 3 of these 12 regions, additional health and/or education databases will be linked at an individual level. These data will be used to establish differences in EDI outcomes in relation to the age-of-onset of diagnosis, and presence of intervention or treatment. Study methodologies have been approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board. The results of the analyses of developmental health outcomes for children with health disorders combined with SES will have implications for both health service delivery and school-based intervention strategies.

Pan and Hamilton (2018, Br. J. Psychol.) provide a useful overview of methodological recommendations for using VR. Here, we highlight some other aspects of the use of VR. Our first argument is that VR can be useful by virtue of its differences from the normal perceptual environment. That is, by virtue of its relative non-realism and poverty of its perceptual elements, it can actually offer increased clarity with respect to the features of interest for the researcher. Our second argument is that VR exerts its measurable influence more by eliciting an acceptance of the virtual world (i.e., 'suspension of disbelief') rather than by eliciting a true belief of the realism of the VR environment. We conclude by providing a novel suggestion for combining neuroimaging methods with embodied VR that relies on the suspension of disbelief.",2018,8,1,"British journal of psychology (London, England : 1953)","10.1111/bjop.12308",NA,"Br J Psychol","eng","D006801; D011601; D000076142","Humans; Psychophysics; Virtual Reality",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Computer Science, University College London, UK."

We therefore aimed to estimate the most important economic consequences at age 50 of being bullied in childhood: to our knowledge this is the first study that does so. Using 1958 British birth cohort data collected in 1965, 1969, 1991, 2003 and 2008 (study samples size 7323-9242), we find substantial and durable individual and societal economic impacts four decades after the childhood bullying occurred. Both men and women who were bullied in childhood were less likely to be in employment and had accumulated less wealth in the form of home-ownership or savings than participants who were not bullied. Individual earnings from paid employment were lower for women who were bullied in childhood. Frequent bullying in childhood was also associated with higher societal employment-related costs for men and higher health service costs for women. Our findings underline the importance of preventing bullying in childhood and, as the consequences are so long-lasting and pervasive, supporting people still experiencing the negative consequences in the decades that follow.",2018,7,1,"Social science &amp; medicine (1982)","10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.05.014",NA,"Soc Sci Med","eng","D000069586; D058445; D015331; D004651; D005260; D006801; D007182; D008297; D008875; D011203; D006113","Adult Survivors of Child Adverse Events; Bullying; Cohort Studies; Employment; Female; Humans; Income; Male; Middle Aged; Poverty; United Kingdom",NA,"NA",NA,"MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London SE5 8AF, UK."

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) effectively reduces both insomnia and depression severity, and can be delivered digitally. This could substantially increase the accessibility to CBT-I, which could reduce the health disparities related to insomnia; however, the efficacy of digital CBT-I (dCBT-I) across a range of demographic groups has not yet been adequately examined. This randomized placebo-controlled trial examined the efficacy of dCBT-I in reducing both insomnia and depression across a wide range of demographic groups. Of 1358 individuals with insomnia randomized, a final sample of 358 were retained in the dCBT-I condition and 300 in the online sleep education condition. Severity of insomnia and depression was examined as a dependent variable. Race, socioeconomic status (SES; household income and education), gender, and age were also tested as independent moderators of treatment effects. The dCBT-I condition yielded greater reductions in both insomnia and depression severity than sleep education, with significantly higher rates of remission following treatment. Demographic variables (i.e. income, race, sex, age, education) were not significant moderators of the treatment effects, suggesting that dCBT-I is comparably efficacious across a wide range of demographic groups. Furthermore, while differences in attrition were found based on SES, attrition did not differ between white and black participants. Results provide evidence that the wide dissemination of dCBT-I may effectively target both insomnia and comorbid depression across a wide spectrum of the population.",2019,2,1,"Psychological medicine","10.1017/S0033291718001113","PMC7050476","Psychol Med","eng","D000328; D000368; D015928; D003863; D005260; D006801; D016014; D008297; D008824; D008875; D007319; D017216; D016896","Adult; Aged; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Depression; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Michigan; Middle Aged; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Telemedicine; Treatment Outcome","K23 HL138166; R56 MH115150","NA",NA,"Sleep Disorders and Research Center, Henry Ford Health System,Detroit, MI,USA."

Oral corticosteroids are alternative interventions but evidence for the optimal agent, dose, duration, efficacy and long-term effects is lacking. A systematic review of the literature was performed to assess the quality of evidence of prednisone and prednisolone (oral corticosteroids) for the management of epileptic spasms. There is level C recommendation based on class III evidence to support the efficacy of oral corticosteroids for the acute clinical control of epileptic spasms and EEG resolution. Efficacy of oral corticosteroids in comparison to the internationally recommended intervention of ACTH has class IV evidence supporting level U recommendation. Similarly, there is no data on the risk of relapse with oral corticosteroids (class IV, level U), compared to ACTH. There is class IV evidence supporting level U recommendation for the safety of oral corticosteroids and class II evidence for level B recommendation for ACTH. In terms of oral corticosteroids and effects on long-term development there is class IV evidence leading to level U recommendation, compared to class III evidence supporting level C recommendation for ACTH. Randomized controlled studies are needed to compare oral corticosteroids with ACTH, the optimal dosage and regimen as well as the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.

However, the relationships between these phenomena has not been studied sufficiently and through time in most European countries that suffered, or, like Greece, are still suffering the recent financial crisis. We examined if the recent financial crisis in Greece has coincided with an increase in crime, analyzing crime rates since the start of the financial crisis and over an extensive time period (7 years). Crime statistics were taken from the Greek Police. Repeated measures analyses of variance were performed to reveal potential differences in criminality for the years 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014. There was a significant increase in global criminality rate per 100,000 residents (Wilks' Lambda=0.32, F (3,11)=7.93, p=0.004). There was a significant increase in illegal gun possession (Wilks' Lambda=0.16, F (3,11)=18.68, p=0.001), fraud (Wilks' Lambda=0.10, F (3,11)=32.35, p=0.001), extortion (Wilks' Lambda=0.38, F (3,11)=4.45, p=0.040), and beggary (Wilks' Lambda=0.33, F (3,11)=6.22, p=0.014). A reversed U shape was found for homicides, thefts and robberies, with rates peaking in 2010 and 2012 before dropping off in 2014. Narcotics and sexual exploitation crime rates remained unchanged. Surprisingly, the incidence of rape decreased (Wilks' Lambda=0.42, F (3,11)=5.14, p=0.018). Our results are in agreement with the results of previous broader studies as well as with criminological theories according to which in times of economic stress an increase in both property crimes and violent crimes is expected. As predicted, an increase in financial crime was observed (e.g. fraud and extortions) as well as petty crime related to financial hardship like beggary.

Despite recognition of environmental contributors, little is known about the influence of neighborhood characteristics. The present study examined the moderating role of community-level risks and resources on the relation of family SES to children's daily cortisol output and physical health during the kindergarten year. In fall and spring of kindergarten, children's (N = 338) daily total cortisol was measured and parents and teachers rated children's global physical health. Parents reported family SES. Neighborhood characteristics were assessed using the Child Opportunity Index, a population-level tool that evaluates the quality of multiple domains of neighborhood attributes. In fall, children reared in lower SES family environments had higher cortisol when residing in lower quality (lower opportunity) neighborhoods (b = -.097, p &lt; .001), but there was no relation between family SES and children's cortisol in more advantaged (higher opportunity) neighborhoods (b = -.023, p = .36). Lower family SES was prospectively associated with poorer physical health in spring (controlling for fall health) only among children living in lower opportunity neighborhoods (b = -.250, p = .018) and was unrelated to physical health among children residing in higher opportunity neighborhoods (b = .042, p = .70). Higher opportunity neighborhoods may protect against the negative consequences of low family SES on children's stress physiology and physical health.

Patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer (LAHNC) experience detrimental effects on their quality of life (QoL). This prospective study examines QoL differences between patients with different socioeconomic status (SES) after intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). In all, 161&#xa0;patients were questioned at the end of IMRT and at 12 and 24&#xa0;months follow-up using the questionnaires of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-30 and QLQ-HN35. Patients' QoL 2&#xa0;years after IMRT was compared to a population reference sample and QoL of patients from lower, middle, and higher social class 2&#xa0;years after IMRT was analyzed by ANCOVA using baseline QoL (end of radiation treatment) as a covariate.

QoL improved during the first 12 and 24 months. However, 2&#xa0;years after IMRT, middle and low SES patients report lower QoL in the domains global health status, physical function, and role function, and report a higher general (fatigue, pain, dyspnea) and head and neck cancer-specific symptom burden (pain, swallowing, senses, speech, social eating, opening mouth, and felt ill) than patients with high SES. After IMRT for LAHNC, patients with high SES report worse QoL compared to patients with middle or low SES. There is a marked improvement within the first 24&#xa0;months in many domains.

A Graphical Modeling Approach.","Pascale Col&#xe9;, Eddy Cavalli, Lynne G Duncan, Anne Theurel, Edouard Gentaz, Liliane Sprenger-Charolles, Abdessadek El-Ahmadi","Children from low-SES families are known to show delays in aspects of language development which underpin reading acquisition such as vocabulary and listening comprehension. Research on the development of morphological skills in this group is scarce, and no studies exist in French. The present study investigated the involvement of morphological knowledge in the very early stages of reading acquisition (decoding), before reading comprehension can be reliably assessed. We assessed listening comprehension, receptive vocabulary, phoneme awareness, morphological awareness as well as decoding, word reading and non-verbal IQ in 703 French first-graders from low-SES families after 3 months of formal schooling (November). Awareness of derivational morphology was assessed using three oral tasks: Relationship Judgment (e.g., do these words belong to the same family or not? heat-heater &#x2026; ham-hammer); Lexical Sentence Completion [e.g., Someone who runs is a &#x2026;? (runner)]; and Non-lexical Sentence Completion [e.g., Someone who lums is a&#x2026;? (lummer)]. The tasks differ on implicit/explicit demands and also tap different kinds of morphological knowledge. The Judgement task measures the phonological and semantic properties of the morphological relationship and the Sentence Completion tasks measure knowledge of morphological production rules. Data were processed using a graphical modeling approach which offers key information about how skills known to be involved in learning to read are organized in memory. This modeling approach was therefore useful in revealing a potential network which expresses the conditional dependence structure between skills, after which recursive structural equation modeling was applied to test specific hypotheses. Six main conclusions can be drawn from these analyses about low SES reading acquisition: (1) listening comprehension is at the heart of the reading acquisition process; (2) word reading depends directly on phonemic awareness and indirectly on listening comprehension; (3) decoding depends on word reading; (4) Morphological awareness and vocabulary have an indirect influence on word reading via both listening comprehension and phoneme awareness; (5) the components of morphological awareness assessed by our tasks have independent relationships with listening comprehension; and (6) neither phonemic nor morphological awareness influence vocabulary directly. The implications of these results with regard to early reading acquisition among low SES groups are discussed.",2018,1,1,"Frontiers in psychology","10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00547","PMC5917267","Front Psychol","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.2307/1166112; 10.1044/1092-4388(2011/10-0115); 10.1044/0161-1461(2012/12-0042); 10.1177/0022219413509964; 10.1097/TLD.0b013e318280f57b; 10.1348/026151007X186643; 10.1002/ajmg.b.30065; 10.3102/0034654309359353; 10.1006/jecp.1998.2450; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2013.03.007; 10.1080/02702710390227369; 10.1017/S0142716400009541; 10.1598/RRQ.40.4.3; 10.1037/0012-1649.39.5.913; 10.1177/0142723708097484; 10.1023/A:1008177205648; 10.1109/TIT.1968.1054142; 10.5815/ijmecs.2011.04.02; 10.1111/j.1467-9817.2010.01496.x; 10.1017/S0142716404001110; 10.2307/2528966; 10.1044/jslhr.4206.1432; 10.1348/000712600161736; 10.1017/S0142716409090213; 10.1186/1471-2105-11-18; 10.1111/desc.12019; 10.3758/BF03201160; 10.1097/DBP.0b013e3181a7ed6c; 10.1126/science.1094068; 10.1371/journal.pone.0119581; 10.1371/journal.pone.0078608; 10.1177/074193258600700104; 10.1080/00131911.2016.1164667; 10.1016/j.dr.2005.11.002; 10.1037/a0027238; 10.1007/BF00401799; 10.1037/1082-989X.3.4.424; 10.1111/cdep.12005; 10.1006/jecp.2002.2670; 10.1016/S0010-0285(02)00500-5; 10.1016/j.cogpsych.2010.08.002; 10.1080/10888430802132279; 10.2307/270722; 10.1177/0022219413509968; 10.1044/0161-1461(2013/12-0013); 10.1111/j.1741-4369.2008.00487.x; 10.1007/s11145-010-9276-5; 10.1037/0708-5591.49.2.103; 10.1016/j.jecp.2012.09.014; 10.1111/jcpp.12029; 10.1016/j.ridd.2017.05.003; 10.1023/A:1008168902922; 10.1016/j.jecp.2017.02.015; 10.1037/0012-1649.36.5.596; 10.1037/0022-0663.90.2.294; 10.1007/BF01027276; 10.1016/j.cortex.2015.06.006; 10.1006/cogp.1999.0734; 10.1016/j.learninstruc.2013.09.003; 10.1037/0012-1649.40.5.665; 10.1037/0022-0663.98.1.134; 10.1037/0022-0663.95.4.730; 10.1080/17470210802034603; 10.1111/j.1467-9817.2004.00238.x; 10.1348/026151008X372492; 10.1007/s11145-008-9159-1; 10.1111/j.1467-9817.2010.01486.x; 10.1177/0022219413509970; 10.1007/s11145-007-9077-7; 10.1016/j.jecp.2008.01.004; 10.1186/1297-9686-43-6; 10.1007/s10212-011-0071-8; 10.1348/000712603321661859; 10.1016/0010-0277(94)00645-2; 10.1006/jecp.1998.2481; 10.1037/0022-0663.76.6.1309; 10.1007/BF02294623; 10.1017/S0142716413000246; 10.1007/s11145-015-9557-0; 10.1207/s15327906mbr2502_4; 10.1177/0022219414528540; 10.1111/jcpp.12412; 10.1002/rrq.102; 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01222; 10.1177/0022219411432685; 10.1177/0022219409345009; 10.1016/j.bandl.2012.09.005; 10.1177/0022219414544544; 10.1037/0022-0663.85.1.83; 10.1023/A:1021789804977; 10.1044/0161-1461(2009/08-0001)",NA,"Laboratoire de Neurosciences Sensorielles et Cognitives (UMR Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 7260), Aix-Marseille Universit&#xe9;, Marseille, France."

We investigated all patients with PNES admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit at the Shiraz Comprehensive Epilepsy Center from 2008 through 2013. Patients included in this study had a confirmed diagnosis of PNES. In a phone call interview to the patients in December 2017, we obtained the following information: seizure outcome (seizure-free during the past 12 months or not), history of receiving any psychotherapy after confirming their diagnosis in the past, and number of psychotherapy sessions the patient had received. Eighty-six patients (54 females and 32 males) met the inclusion criteria. Seventy-four (86%) patients did not receive appropriate psychotherapy. Forty-seven (54.7%) patients were seizure-free during the past 12 months. Age at onset (P&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.02), education (P&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.01), and taking psychiatric drugs (P&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.007) were associated with this outcome. Resources to treat patients with PNES are limited in Iran; however, more than half of the patients became free of seizures. Lower education, comorbid psychiatric problems, and a later age at the onset of seizures may affect the seizure outcome in patients with PNES.

Associations between depressive symptoms and CHD risk were estimated using linear regression models in SES strata. The estimated 10-year risk of CHD was 16.9% in men and 1.8% in women. In men, the increased CHD risk in those with (versus without) depressive symptoms was more pronounced as occupational status decreased, being 0.65% (-0.57; 1.88), 1.58% (0.50; 2.66) and 3.19% (1.30; 5.07) higher in individuals of high, medium and low occupational status, respectively (p for interaction: 0.01). In contrast, effect modification by education or household income was less evident, despite similar trends. In women, no effect modification was found whatever the SES indicator. Depressive symptoms and 10-year estimated CHD risk were more tightly linked in individuals of lower SES, at least in men. Occupational status was the SES indicator that displays the most obvious effect modification on this association.",2018,7,1,"International journal of cardiology","10.1016/j.ijcard.2018.02.033",NA,"Int J Cardiol","eng","D000293; D000328; D000368; D002318; D003863; D005260; D005500; D005544; D005602; D006801; D015994; D008297; D008875; D018570; D012923; D015996; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Depression; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Forecasting; France; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Assessment; Social Class; Survival Rate; Young Adult",NA,"NA",NA,"Universit&#xe9; Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cit&#xe9;, Facult&#xe9; de M&#xe9;decine, Paris, France; Inserm, U894, Centre Psychiatrie et Neurosciences, Paris, France; AP-HP, H&#xf4;pitaux Universitaires Paris Ouest, Service de Psychiatrie de l'adulte et du sujet &#xe2;g&#xe9;, Paris, France."

The reduction of epilepsy TG in the rural area of the Chaco region, Plurinational State of Bolivia, has been the aim of many projects based on the reinforcement of the primary care setting. To plan educational campaigns directed to the healthcare professionals, it is necessary to establish their baseline knowledge level. The objective of our study was to assess the baseline level of knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards epilepsy among general practitioners (GPs) of the rural communities of the Chaco region. The study was conducted in three departments of Bolivia. All the GPs living in these areas were invited to participate in the study consisting of two training modules six months apart from each other, each with two-day duration. They answered a validated questionnaire to evaluate the KAP towards epilepsy before and after the courses. Fifty GPs [30 men (60%); mean age: 32.1&#xb1;5.8years] participated in the first training course. After six months, 31 GPs (62%) [19 men (61.3%); mean age: 33&#xb1;5.0years] participated in the second module. Before the training, the majority of GPs declared a low level of satisfaction about their epilepsy knowledge, which improved after the courses. A change in practices was recorded after the training, with an increased confidence to manage antiepileptic treatment.

Understanding genetic and environmental influences on body mass index (BMI) during adolescence could inform interventions. We investigated independent and interactive effects of parenting, socioeconomic status (SES) and polygenic risk on BMI pre-adolescence, and on the rate of change in BMI across adolescence. Genome-wide genotype data, BMI and child perceptions of parental warmth and punitive discipline were available at 11 years old, and parental SES was available from birth on 3,414 unrelated participants. Linear models were used to test the effects of social environment and polygenic risk on pre-adolescent BMI. Change in BMI across adolescence was assessed in a subset (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;1943).

We aimed to study the effect of care dependence among older adult residents on the economic functioning of their households, in catchment area survey sites in Peru, Mexico and China. Households were classified from the evolution of the needs for care of older residents, over two previous community surveys, as 'incident care', 'chronic care' or 'no care', and followed up three years later to ascertain economic outcomes (household income, consumption, economic strain, satisfaction with economic circumstances, healthcare expenditure and residents giving up work or education to care). Household income did not differ between household groups. However, income from paid work (Pooled Count Ratio pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78-1.00) and government transfers (pCR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.93) were lower in care households. Consumption was 12% lower in chronic care households (pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77-0.99). Household healthcare expenditure was higher (pCR 1.55, 95% CI 1.26-1.90), and catastrophic healthcare spending more common (pRR 1.64, 95% CI 1.64-2.22) in care households. While endogeneity cannot be confidently excluded as an explanation for the findings, this study indicates that older people's needs for care have a discernable impact on household economics, controlling for baseline indicators of long-term economic status. Although living, typically, in multigenerational family units, older people have not featured prominently in global health and development agendas. Population ageing will rapidly increase the number of households where older people live, and their societal significance. Building sustainable long-term care systems for the future will require some combination of improved income security in old age; incentivisation of informal care through compensation for direct and opportunity costs; and development of community care services to support, and, where necessary, supplement or substitute the central role of informal caregivers.",2018,1,1,"PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0195567","PMC5898721","PLoS One","eng","D000368; D002681; D015331; D003695; D006798; D006801; D008800; D010568; D012959","Aged; China; Cohort Studies; Delivery of Health Care; Housing; Humans; Mexico; Peru; Socioeconomic Factors",NA,"10.2105/AJPH.2012.301115; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.10.031; 10.1186/1471-2458-8-285; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.08.032; 10.1177/0898264315584577; 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2006.00944.x; 10.1371/journal.pone.0144722; 10.1136/jech-2013-203698; 10.1093/gerona/glt105; 10.1080/01634372.2015.1019657; 10.1136/bmjopen-2013-002683; 10.1007/s10198-011-0357-4; 10.1080/17441692.2014.971332; 10.1186/1471-2318-10-53; 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61829-8; 10.1002/gps.1046; 10.1002/gps.2727; 10.1186/2193-1801-3-379; 10.1371/journal.pone.0182360; 10.1186/1471-2458-7-165; 10.1002/sim.1186; 10.1017/S1041610214000039; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61147-7; 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61884-3; 10.1080/09540260802094712","<b>Competing Interests: </b>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Health Service and Population Research Department, London, United Kingdom."

Enhancing somatosensory input using somatosensory electrical stimulation (SES) can increase motor performance, but the neuronal mechanisms underlying these effects are largely unknown. With EEG, we examined whether skill acquisition, consolidation, and interlimb transfer after SES was related to increased activity in sensorimotor regions, as assessed by the N30 somatosensory evoked potential or rather increased connectivity between these regions, as assessed by the phase slope index (PSI). Right- and left-hand motor performance and EEG measures were taken before, immediately after, and 24 h ( day 2) after either SES ( n = 12; 5 men) or Control ( n = 12; 5 men). The results showed skill acquisition and consolidation in the stimulated right hand immediately after SES (6%) and on day 2 (9%) and interlimb transfer to the nonstimulated left hand on day 2 relative to Control (8%, all P &lt; 0.05). Increases in N30 amplitudes correlated with skill acquisition while PSI from electrodes that represent the posterior parietal and primary somatosensory cortex to the electrode representing the primary motor cortex correlated with skill consolidation. In contrast, interlimb transfer did not correlate with the EEG-derived neurophysiological estimates obtained in the present study, which may indicate the involvement of subcortical structures in interlimb transfer after SES. In conclusion, weak peripheral somatosensory inputs in the form of SES improve skill acquisition, consolidation, and interlimb transfer that coincide with different cortical adaptations, including enhanced N30 amplitudes and PSI. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY The relationship between adaptations in synaptic plasticity and motor learning following somatosensory electrical stimulation (SES) is incompletely understood. Here, we used for the first time a multifactorial approach that examined skill acquisition, consolidation, and interlimb transfer following 20 min of SES. In addition, we quantified sensorimotor integration and the magnitude and direction of connectivity with EEG.

"29632682","A systematic review of interventions targeting men's alcohol use and family relationships in low- and middle-income countries.","Ali Giusto, Eve Puffer","Problem drinking accounts for 9.6% of disability-adjusted life years worldwide. It disproportionally affects men and has disabling physical, psychological, and behavioral consequences. These can lead to a cascade of negative effects on men's families, with documented ties to intimate partner violence (IPV) and child maltreatment. These multi-level problems are often exacerbated where poverty rates are high, including low and middle-income countries (LMICs). In contexts where strong patriarchal norms place men in positions of power, family-level consequences are often even more pronounced. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on interventions in LMICs targeting men's problem drinking and any family-related outcomes. Cochrane and PRISMA procedures guided the review. The search was conducted in PsychInfo, PubMed, and Web of Science. The search yielded 1357 publications. Nine studies from four different countries met inclusion criteria. Of those, only one had the primary goal of simultaneously improving drinking and a related family-level outcome (IPV). Six of the studies documented modest improvements on both drinking and couples or family outcomes. Strategies common to these included cognitive-behavioral techniques, communication skills training, narrative therapy, and participatory learning. Gender-transformative approaches were associated with reduced IPV and more equitable gender norms, and motivational interviewing and behavioral approaches were beneficial for reducing alcohol use. Findings highlight the scarcity of interventions addressing men's drinking and its effects on families, particularly for parent-child outcomes. However, results point to strategies that, combined with other evidence-based family interventions can guide the development and rigorous evaluation of integrated programs.",2018,1,1,"Global mental health (Cambridge, England)","10.1017/gmh.2017.32","PMC5885490","Glob Ment Health (Camb)","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.jsat.2008.05.006; 10.1111/jpm.12133; 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-050212-185629; 10.1037/a0027085; 10.1111/j.1467-6427.2012.00600.x; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000170; 10.1037/a0016401; 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-033109-132032; 10.1017/S0033291713001785; 10.1186/s12889-016-3262-z; 10.2471/BLT.10.085217; 10.1177/1559827608323213; 10.1007/s10896-011-9386-0; 10.1111/acer.12766; 10.1093/alcalc/ags040; 10.3402/gha.v9.31516; 10.1093/brief-treatment/mhn010; 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61683-4; 10.1136/bmj.a506; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2010.05.002; 10.1007/s10900-013-9753-2; 10.1007/s00127-012-0630-6; 10.1007/s11121-009-0129-x; 10.1080/17441692.2014.921829; 10.1037/a0013459; 10.1177/1077559509334091; 10.1093/eurjhf/hfp037; 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.3.022806.091424; 10.1037/a0035301; 10.1177/1524838014523336; 10.1007/s10567-012-0116-9; 10.2147/SAR.S46439; 10.1080/01926187.2012.741897; 10.1016/j.cbpra.2013.06.005; 10.1016/j.cpr.2015.04.004; 10.1111/jcpp.12280; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61240-9; 10.1016/j.cpr.2008.02.002; 10.1111/dar.12184; 10.1017/gmh.2015.12; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.02899.x; 10.1071/SH13076; 10.1016/j.jsat.2016.02.005; 10.1007/s10461-010-9724-x; 10.1093/ije/dyu038; 10.1177/1077801216689163; 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61611-6",NA,"Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke Global Health Institute, Duke University, 417 Chapel Drive, Durham, NC 27708, USA."

No reviews so far have assessed the methodologic quality of available intervention studies or have bundled the effect sizes of individual studies on exercise-induced effects on BDNF blood levels in human PD. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and PubMed from inception to June 2017. Data aggregated from two randomized controlled trials and four pre-experimental studies with a total of 100 ambulatory patients with idiopathic PD (Hoehn/Yahr &#x2264;3) found improvements in BDNF blood concentration levels in all 6 studies (two RCTs and 4 pre-experimental studies). Pooled BDNF level change scores from the 2 RCTs resulted in a significant homogeneous summary effect size (Standardized Mean Difference 2.06, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.76), and a significant heterogeneous SES for the motor part of the UPDRS-III examination (MD -5.53, 95% CI -10.42 to -0.64).

The objective of the present study was to validate the Portuguese version of the SIS/SES and to investigate the degree to which SIS/SES scores predict different dimensions of Portuguese men's and women's sexual functioning. Gender differences were also examined. A community sample of 370 Portuguese men and 373 women completed self-report measures of sexual function (IIEF, Rosen et al., 1997; FSFI, Rosen et al., 2000) and of the propensity for sexual inhibition and sexual excitation (SIS/SES, Janssen et al., 2002a). Exploratory factor analysis revealed a three-factor solution further supported by confirmatory factor analysis. The three factors identified resemble the original ones, and reliability analyses indicated they have both satisfactory internal consistency and stability over time. Age and Sexual Inhibition Due to the Threat of Performance Failure (SIS1) were both significant negative predictors of men's sexual desire, erectile function, and orgasm. Sexual Excitation (SES) was a positive predictor of sexual desire in both men and women and of men's erectile function and of women's lubrication and orgasm. Age was also a significant and negative predictor of women's sexual desire. Significant gender differences were found for all three SIS/SES scales with men having significantly higher excitation and lower inhibition scores as compared to women. The Portuguese version of the SIS/SES was shown to be suitable for use within the Portuguese population in both clinical and basic research. Our findings provide further cross-cultural validation of the Dual Control Model of Sexual Response and underscore the importance of the role of excitatory and inhibitory processes in women's and men's sexual functioning and response.",2018,8,1,"Archives of sexual behavior","10.1007/s10508-017-1137-8",NA,"Arch Sex Behav","eng","D000328; D005163; D005260; D006801; D007266; D008297; D008875; D009948; D010410; D011174; D011594; D015203; D057566; D012737; D012725; D020018; D011795","Adult; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Inhibition, Psychological; Male; Middle Aged; Orgasm; Penile Erection; Portugal; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Self Report; Sex Factors; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",NA,"NA",NA,"Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal."

However, little is known about the correlates of SB in people with depression. Thus, we investigated SB correlates among community-dwelling adults with depression in six low- and middle-income countries. Cross-sectional data from the World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health were analyzed. The analysis was restricted to those with DSM-IV Depression or receiving depression treatment in the last 12 months. Self-reported time spent sedentary per day was the outcome. High SB was defined as &#x2265;8 hours of SB per day. The correlates (sociodemographic and health-related) of SB were estimated by multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses. In 2375 individuals with depression (mean age=48.0 years; 60.7% female), the prevalence of high SB was 11.1% (95%CI=8.2%-14.9%), while the mean (&#xb1;SD) time spent sedentary was 215 (&#xb1;192) minutes per day. Socio-demographic factors significantly associated with high SB were older age and being unmarried, being male and being unemployed. In other domains, no alcohol consumption, current smoking, mild cognitive impairment, bodily pain, arthritis, stroke, disability, and lower levels of social cohesion, COPD, visual impairment, and poor self-rated health was associated with greater time spent sedentary. Our data suggest that future interventions seeking to reduce SB among individuals with depression may target at risk groups based on identified sociodemographic correlates while the promotion of social cohesion may have the potential to increase the efficacy of future public health initiatives. From a clinical perspective, bodily pain and somatic co-morbidities need to be taken into account.",2018,7,1,"Journal of affective disorders","10.1016/j.jad.2018.02.088",NA,"J Affect Disord","eng","D000293; D000328; D000368; D002681; D003430; D003866; D003906; D005260; D005869; D006801; D007194; D008297; D008800; D008875; D011203; D015995; D012426; D057185; D013019; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depressive Disorder; Developing Countries; Female; Ghana; Humans; India; Male; Mexico; Middle Aged; Poverty; Prevalence; Russia; Sedentary Behavior; South Africa; Young Adult","ICA-CL-2017-03-001","NA",NA,"Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Centro de Investigaci&#xf3;n Biom&#xe9;dica en Red de Salud Mental, CIBERSAM, Monforte de Lemos 3-5 Pabell&#xf3;n 11, Madrid 28029, Spain; Research and Development Unit, Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de D&#xe9;u, Universitat de Barcelona, Fundaci&#xf3; Sant Joan de D&#xe9;u, Dr. Antoni Pujadas, 42, Sant Boi de Llobregat, Barcelona 0883, Spain."

This is largely because of the ethical, legal, and regulatory complexities in the enrolment, consent, and appropriate access of children of minor parents to clinical research. Using a case-based approach, we examine appropriate access of children of minor parents in an international vaccine trial. We first consider the scientific justification for inclusion of children of minor parents in a vaccine trial. Laws and regulations governing consent generally do not address the issue of minor parents. In their absence, local community and cultural contexts may influence consent processes. Rights of the minor parent include dignity in their role as a parent and respect for their decision-making capacity in that role. Rights of the child include the right to have decisions made in their best interest and the right to the highest attainable standard of health. Children of minor parents may have vulnerabilities related to the age of their parent, such as increased rates of poverty, that have implications for consent. Neuroscience research suggests that, by age 12-14&#xa0;years, minors have adult-level capacity to make research decisions in situations with low emotion and low distraction. We conclude with a set of recommendations based on these findings to facilitate appropriate access and equity related to the participation of children of minor parents in clinical research.",2018,6,1,"Paediatric drugs","10.1007/s40272-017-0280-y","PMC5954045","Paediatr Drugs","eng","D000293; D002648; D003657; D006801; D007258; D033242; D010290","Adolescent; Child; Decision Making; Humans; Informed Consent; Minors; Parents","None - GSK covered meeting costs; editorial support","10.4103/2229-3485.106403; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001657; 10.1016/j.acap.2010.06.008; 10.1016/S1701-2163(15)30995-6; 10.1007/s13524-014-0301-1; 10.1007/s00431-003-1192-0; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.08.005; 10.1097/QAI.0b013e3181e2012e; 10.1136/archdischild-2014-306444; 10.1186/1472-6963-13-383; 10.1086/430707; 10.1111/j.1748-720X.2009.00345.x; 10.1023/A:1024646912928; 10.1111/j.1748-720X.2009.00347.x; 10.1136/adc.2009.178707; 10.1007/s11910-010-0123-5; 10.1038/nn.3177; 10.1016/j.dr.2008.01.002; 10.1017/S1355617707070841; 10.1093/jmp/jht017; 10.1186/s12910-015-0067-z; 10.2307/1130087; 10.1177/1556264616636232; 10.1136/medethics-2012-100821; 10.1136/jme.2006.019059; 10.1001/archpediatrics.2011.87; 10.1007/s00431-003-1378-5; 10.1111/tmi.12396","Mary Ott&#x2019;s spouse is an employee of Eli Lilly, Inc., and the couple are small stockholders in Eli Lilly, Inc.

Participants were part of a household multistage probability sample of 2149 Nigerians who were aged 65&#xa0;years and above. The presence of current and lifetime MDD was assessed using the World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Participants' highest occupational attainment was categorised based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations, while socio-economic positions were estimated using asset-based measures relevant to low-income settings. Current social contacts and participation were assessed using items from the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule. We found an incidence rate of 120.9 per 1000 persons years (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;110.4-132.5) among 1394 persons who were free of lifetime MDD and dementia at baseline. Incidence rates were 94.7 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;82.5-108.7) and 153.8 (136.3-173.6) per 1000 person years, in men and women respectively.

"29445850","Factors associated with household food insecurity and depression in pregnant South African women from a low socio-economic setting: a cross-sectional study.","Zulfa Abrahams, Crick Lund, Sally Field, Simone Honikman","Food insecurity has been linked with maternal depression in low-income settings. Few studies have looked at factors associated with both food insecurity and maternal depression as outcomes. This study aimed to assess factors associated with food insecurity and depression in a sample of pregnant South African women. We conducted a cross-sectional study at a Midwife Obstetric Unit in a low-income suburb in Cape Town. Pregnant women attending the clinic for their first antenatal visit were invited to participate. The shortened form of the US Household Food Security Survey Module was used to measure food insecurity. The Expanded Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview was used to diagnose depression, anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and assess for suicidal ideation and behaviour. Logistic regression modelling was conducted to explore factors associated with food insecurity and depression in separate models. We found that 42% of households were food insecure and that 21% of participants were depressed (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;376). The odds of being food insecure were increased in women with suicidal behaviour (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.34; 95% CI 1.26-22.57), with depression (4.27; 1.43-12.70) and in those with three or more children (3.79; 1.25-11.55). The odds of depression was greater in women who were food insecure (5.30; 1.63-17.30), substance dependent (15.83; 1.31-191.48) or diagnosed with an anxiety disorder (5.04; 1.71-14.82).

To explore this further, we aimed to determine whether these agents are associated with serum markers of bone turnover utilising a population-based sample of men (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1138; 20-96&#xa0;year) participating in the Geelong Osteoporosis Study. Blood samples were obtained and the bone resorption marker, C-telopeptide (CTx) and formation marker, type 1 procollagen amino-terminal-propeptide (PINP) were measured. Anthropometry and socio-economic status (SES) were determined and information on medication use and lifestyle was obtained via questionnaire. Lifetime mood disorders were assessed using semi-structured clinical interviews. Thirty-seven (3.3%) men reported using SSRIs. Age was an effect modifier in the association between SSRIs and markers of bone turnover. Among younger men (20-60&#xa0;year; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;557), adjusted mean CTx and PINP values were 12.4% [16.7 (95% CI 14.6-18.8) vs 19.1 (95% CI 18.7-19.4)&#xa0;pg/ml, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03] and 13.6% [5.6 (95% CI 4.9-6.3) vs 6.4 (95% CI 6.3-6.6)&#xa0;pg/ml, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02] lower among SSRI users compared to non-users, respectively.

These patterns persisted after further adjustment for activity, alcohol, smoking, SES, depression, bone active medications and other antidepressants. Our data suggest that SSRI use is associated with alterations in bone turnover markers among younger men.

Individuals aged 50 and older (N=32,715; mean age 62.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;15.6; 51.7% female). The definition of MCI was based on the recommendations of the National Institute on Ageing and Alzheimer's Association. Ten chronic conditions were assessed (angina pectoris, arthritis, asthma, cataract, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, edentulism, hearing problems, hypertension, stroke). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between chronic physical conditions, multimorbidity (&#x2265;2 chronic conditions), and MCI. The prevalence of multimorbidity was 49.8% (95% confidence interval (CI)=48.1-51.5%) and of MCI was 15.3% (95% CI=14.4-16.3%). After adjustment for potential confounders, edentulism (odds ratio (OR)=1.24), arthritis (OR=1.24), chronic lung disease (OR=1.29), cataract (OR=1.33), stroke (OR=1.94), hearing problems (OR=2.27), and multimorbidity (OR=1.40) were significantly associated with MCI.

"29422037","Coping strategies of women with postpartum depression symptoms in rural Ethiopia: a cross-sectional community study.","Telake Azale, Abebaw Fekadu, Girmay Medhin, Charlotte Hanlon","Most women with postpartum depression (PPD) in low- and middle-income countries remain undiagnosed and untreated, despite evidence for adverse effects on the woman and her child. The aim of this study was to identify the coping strategies used by women with PPD symptoms in rural Ethiopia to inform the development of socio-culturally appropriate interventions. A population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in a predominantly rural district in southern Ethiopia. All women with live infants between one and 12&#xa0;months post-partum (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3147) were screened for depression symptoms using the validated Patient Health Questionnaire, 9 item version (PHQ-9). Those scoring five or more, 'high PPD symptoms', (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;385) were included in this study. The Brief Coping with Problems Experienced (COPE-28) scale was used to assess coping strategies. Construct validity of the brief COPE was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis of the brief COPE scale supported the previously hypothesized three dimensions of coping (problem-focused, emotion-focused, and dysfunctional). Emotion-focused coping was the most commonly employed coping strategy by women with PPD symptoms. Urban residence was associated positively with all three dimensions of coping. Women who had attended formal education and who attributed their symptoms to a physical cause were more likely to use both problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies. Women with better subjective wealth and those who perceived that their husband drank too much alcohol were more likely to use emotion-focused coping. Dysfunctional coping strategies were reported by women who had a poor relationship with their husbands. As in high-income countries, women with PPD symptoms were most likely to use emotion-focused and dysfunctional coping strategies. Poverty and the low level of awareness of depression as an illness may additionally impede problem-solving attempts to cope. Prospective studies are needed to understand the prognostic significance of coping styles in this setting and to inform psychosocial intervention development.",2018,2,8,"BMC psychiatry","10.1186/s12888-018-1624-z","PMC5806287","BMC Psychiatry","eng","D000223; D000328; D003430; D019052; D004644; D005002; D005163; D005260; D006801; D010465; D011247; D011340; D012424","Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression, Postpartum; Emotions; Ethiopia; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Perception; Pregnancy; Problem Solving; Rural Population","MR/M025470/1; 201446","10.4103/2141-9248.139268; 10.2471/BLT.11.091850; 10.1093/bmb/ldr047; 10.2471/BLT.11.088187; 10.1186/1471-244X-10-32; 10.1111/j.1740-8709.2007.00088.x; 10.1111/j.1365-2214.2006.00598.x; 10.1136/adc.2010.183327; 10.1001/archpsyc.61.9.946; 10.1136/adc.2009.165571; 10.1136/adc.88.1.34; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01752.x; 10.1080/03014460802043624; 10.1177/070674370705200803; 10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2013.08.013; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001541; 10.2471/BLT.12.109819; 10.1037/0022-3514.46.4.839; 10.1037/0022-3514.56.2.267; 10.1037/0022-3514.57.6.1024; 10.1159/000346633; 10.12659/MSM.889778; 10.1037/0022-3514.46.4.877; 10.1300/J010v35n01_08; 10.1016/S0015-0282(98)00089-2; 10.1007/s00737-013-0338-y; 10.1007/s00737-003-0038-0; 10.1007/s00127-007-0166-3; 10.1207/s15327558ijbm0401_6; 10.1097/NMD.0b013e31818b504c; 10.1097/HTR.0b013e3181fc5e1e; 10.1080/00223891.2014.886255; 10.1007/s10461-014-0872-2; 10.1177/1359105309346516; 10.3390/rel2030216; 10.1046/j.1525-1497.2001.016009606.x; 10.1016/j.jad.2006.05.021; 10.1002/gps.2442; 10.1111/j.1744-6163.2009.00224.x; 10.1370/afm.933; 10.1016/j.jad.2014.02.012; 10.1016/j.jad.2008.05.009; 10.1016/j.jad.2015.07.015; 10.1017/S0033291798007065; 10.1016/j.jad.2011.11.028; 10.1007/s00127-006-0051-5; 10.1186/1471-244X-14-194; 10.1037/0033-2909.129.2.216; 10.5402/2012/128672; 10.1176/appi.psy.43.6.456; 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(200004)56:4&lt;519::AID-JCLP6&gt;3.0.CO;2-1; 10.1089/jpm.2008.0250; 10.1176/ajp.149.12.1693; 10.1363/3900613; 10.1186/s12939-017-0657-0; 10.1016/S0277-9536(03)00062-5; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.07.043; 10.1016/j.hrtlng.2013.07.009; 10.1111/tmi.12658","ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University.

Nevertheless, characteristics relating to socioeconomic status (SES) are poorly described in research reports. The aim of the present review was to verify whether the SES of participants is adequately reported in interventional studies targeting Alzheimer's disease (AD), and to explore the impact of SES proxy measures on the efficacy of the considered medications. A systematic review of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the currently marketed drugs for AD (i.e. cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine) was conducted by performing a structured search on PubMed and the Cochrane databases. The following indicators of SES were considered in the retained studies: (i) educational level, (ii) lifetime job category, (iii) income and (iv) wealth. The study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomized Controlled Trials. A total of 48 articles were finally selected. Overall, only eight RCTs reported data concerning the four considered SES indicators. Indeed, only information pertaining to the educational level of participants was provided. Only one RCT (n = 60) performed ad hoc, secondary analyses accounting for the SES of participating subjects.

Recently, an oral suspension (OS) of riluzole was made available. Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate the adherence to 2 formulations of riluzole in patients with ALS. We enrolled 45 consecutive patients with ALS. At disease diagnosis, riluzole was prescribed in 2 different formulations depending on the severity of dysphagia (27/45 patients received tablets and 18/45 patients received OS). Side effects (SEs) and treatment adherence were investigated using a clinical questionnaire including the &#xa9;Morisky 8-item Medication Adherence Questionnaire. Gastroenteric complaints were the most frequent SEs (58% in the tablet group and 48% in the OS group), followed by those at the nervous system (29% and 40%, respectively). No serious SEs related to treatment were reported. The rate of adherence to riluzole was independent of the formulation of the drug and consistent with other medications assumed for comorbidities (<i>p</i>=0.004). In the tablet group, low adherence was caused by SEs in 55.6% and by dysphagia in 44.4% of patients. In the OS group, SEs caused low adherence in 75% of patients.

Hazardous drinking was defined as consuming &gt;7 (females) or &gt;14 (males) standard drinks per week. Associations between time spent sedentary and a range of correlates were examined using multivariable linear and logistic regression. The mean time spent sedentary in 2142 individuals with hazardous drinking patterns (mean age = 45.7 years; 13% female) was 216&#xb1;135min/day. Nine percent (95%CI=6.1-13.2%) were sedentary for &#x2265;8h per day. Living in an urban setting and unemployment were strong sociodemographic correlates of being sedentary for &#x2265;8h per day. From a health-related perspective, weak grip strength, stroke and disability were associated with increasing time spent sedentary. The current data provides important guidance for future interventions across low- and middle-income countries to assist hazardous drinkers to reduce sedentary behaviour.",2018,3,1,"Psychiatry research","10.1016/j.psychres.2018.01.025",NA,"Psychiatry Res","eng","D000328; D000368; D000428; D003430; D005260; D006184; D006801; D007182; D057187; D008137; D008297; D008875; D011203; D057185; D011795; D014478; D014505","Adult; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Habits; Humans; Income; Independent Living; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Poverty; Sedentary Behavior; Surveys and Questionnaires; Unemployment; Urban Population","ICA-CL-2017-03-001","NA",NA,"Research and Development Unit, Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de D&#xe9;u, Universitat de Barcelona, Fundaci&#xf3; Sant Joan de D&#xe9;u, Sant Boi de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain; Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Centro de Investigaci&#xf3;n Biom&#xe9;dica en Red de Salud Mental, CIBERSAM, Madrid, Spain."
"29352539","Income inequality and depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association and a scoping review of mechanisms.","Vikram Patel, Jonathan K Burns, Monisha Dhingra, Leslie Tarver, Brandon A Kohrt, Crick Lund","Most countries have witnessed a dramatic increase of income inequality in the past three decades. This paper addresses the question of whether income inequality is associated with the population prevalence of depression and, if so, the potential mechanisms and pathways which may explain this association. Our systematic review included 26 studies, mostly from high-income countries. Nearly two-thirds of all studies and five out of six longitudinal studies reported a statistically significant positive relationship between income inequality and risk of depression; only one study reported a statistically significant negative relationship. Twelve studies were included in a meta-analysis with dichotomized inequality groupings. The pooled risk ratio was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.07-1.31), demonstrating greater risk of depression in populations with higher income inequality relative to populations with lower inequality. Multiple studies reported subgroup effects, including greater impacts of income inequality among women and low-income populations. We propose an ecological framework, with mechanisms operating at the national level (the neo-material hypothesis), neighbourhood level (the social capital and the social comparison hypotheses) and individual level (psychological stress and social defeat hypotheses) to explain this association. We conclude that policy makers should actively promote actions to reduce income inequality, such as progressive taxation policies and a basic universal income. Mental health professionals should champion such policies, as well as promote the delivery of interventions which target the pathways and proximal determinants, such as building life skills in adolescents and provision of psychological therapies and packages of care with demonstrated effectiveness for settings of poverty and high income inequality.",2018,2,1,"World psychiatry : official journal of the World Psychiatric Association (WPA)","10.1002/wps.20492","PMC5775138","World Psychiatry","eng",NA,NA,"K01 MH104310; R21 MH111280; U19 MH113211","NA",NA,"Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."
"29349277","Patterns of poverty exposure and children's trajectories of externalizing and internalizing behaviors.","Jinette Comeau, Michael H Boyle","Using data from the Child Supplement of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we compare trajectories of externalizing and internalizing behaviors among children exposed to five patterns of poverty from birth to age 14: always or never poor - stable patterns; a single transition into or out of poverty, or repeated fluctuations in and out of poverty - changing patterns. We also examine how low maternal education and single parenthood interact with these poverty exposures to compound their adverse effects. Finally, we compare the magnitude of effects associated with the patterns of poverty exposure, as well as their interactions with low maternal education and single parenthood, on trajectories of externalizing and internalizing behaviors to determine if they are significantly different. Results reveal that initial levels and rates of change in children's trajectories of externalizing and internalizing behaviors are similar across the three changing patterns of poverty exposure, leading us to combine them into a single group representing intermittent poverty. Initial disparities between children who are never poor and their counterparts who are always or intermittently poor are constant over time for internalizing behaviors and grow in magnitude for externalizing behaviors. The cumulative negative effect of poverty exposure over time is stronger for externalizing vs. internalizing behaviors. Low maternal education compounds the adverse effects of persistent poverty, an effect that is similar for externalizing and internalizing behaviors.",2018,4,1,"SSM - population health","10.1016/j.ssmph.2017.11.012","PMC5769125","SSM Popul Health","eng",NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,"Offord Centre for Child Studies, McMaster University, Canada."

All stress experiences are more pronounced in low SES patients with stress emanating from problems with family, job, or money. The SPIRR-CAD study offered an excellent opportunity to examine these risk factors in German speaking mildly and medium depressed patients. In the SPIRR CAD study, a German multi centre randomized clinical trial of 450 male and 120 female coronary patients, we examined the standard and psychosocial risk factor profiles in relation to SES, as assessed by educational level. All differences in risk factors between low and high SES were in the inverse direction. Of standard risk factors, only smoking was socially graded and more common in low SES. Of psychosocial factors and emotions, exhaustion showed the strongest and most consistent inverse social gradient, but also anger, anxiety and depression were socially graded. The findings suggest that in German patients, as in other national groups, social gradients in CHD risk are considerable. They can be ascribed to both psychosocial and to standard risk factors. In the present two years follow-up, the prospective significance of psychological and social risk factors was analyzed showing that emotional factors played an important role, in that low and high SES patients differed in the expected direction.

"29331699","Simultaneous social causation and social drift: Longitudinal analysis of depression and poverty in South Africa.","Crick Lund, Annibale Cois","Two theories have been proposed to explain the observed association between depression and poverty, namely social causation and social drift. Little is known regarding the relative importance of social causation and social drift in low and middle-income countries, where poverty is more severe and where most of the world's depressed individuals live. We analysed nationally representative longitudinal data from the National Income Dynamics Study in South Africa and simultaneously tested social causation and social drift hypotheses using structural equation modelling across three waves. Worse individual economic status at time 1 and 2 was independently associated with worse depression two years later at time 2 (standardised linear regression coefficient &#x3b2; = -0.110, Standard Error (SE): 0.024) and four years later at time 3 (&#x3b2; = -0.113, SE: 0.025) respectively. Conversely worse depression at time 1 and time 2 was independently associated with worse economic status at time 2 (&#x3b2; = -0.037, SE: 0.016) and time 3 (&#x3b2; = -0.028, SE: 0.012) respectively. In addition, the ""effect"" of depression on future assets was stronger among people with less baseline assets. The time span between data rounds is relatively short (four years); response rates are unequal across ethnic, age and sex groups; and the measure of depression is based on self-report. Social causation and social drift act simultaneously in this population, reinforcing poverty/depression cycles. Multi-sectoral policies are required that both prevent depression by addressing its economic determinants, and provide evidence-based treatment to mitigate the economic impact of depression.",2018,3,15,"Journal of affective disorders","10.1016/j.jad.2017.12.050",NA,"J Affect Disord","eng","D000293; D000328; D000368; D000369; D017281; D003863; D005260; D006801; D008137; D008297; D008875; D011203; D013019; D013997; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cost of Illness; Depression; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Poverty; South Africa; Time Factors; Young Adult",NA,"NA",NA,"Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health and Family Medicine, University of Cape Town, South Africa."

The sample of 306 mothers and their preschool children included 29% families at or near poverty, 27% families below the median income, and the remaining families at middle and upper income. Diurnal cortisol, income, cumulative risk, and parenting were measured at 4 time points, once every 9months, starting when children were 36-40months. State-trait models fit the data, suggesting significant state but not trait variance in cortisol. Low income and cumulative risk were related to trait levels of diurnal cortisol with little evidence of time-varying or state effects.

Dementia has been declared a global challenge, yet regions around the world show differences in both the nature and magnitude of such a challenge. This article provides evidence and insights on barriers which, if overcome, would enable the harmonization of strategies to tackle the dementia challenge in LAC. First, we analyze the lack of available epidemiologic data, the need for standardizing clinical practice and improving physician training, and the existing barriers regarding resources, culture, and stigmas. We discuss how these are preventing timely care and research. Regarding specific health actions, most LAC have minimal mental health facilities and do not have specific mental health policies or budgets specific to dementia. In addition, local regulations may need to consider the regional context when developing treatment and prevention strategies. The support needed nationally and internationally to enable a smooth and timely transition of LAC to a position that integrates global strategies is highlighted. We focus on shared issues of poverty, cultural barriers, and socioeconomic vulnerability. We identify avenues for collaboration aimed to study unique populations, improve valid assessment methods, and generate opportunities for translational research, thus establishing a regional network.

We delivered repeated bimodal auditory-somatosensory stimulation to the dorsal cochlear nucleus of guinea pigs with tinnitus, choosing a stimulus interval known to induce long-term depression (LTD). Twenty minutes per day of LTD-inducing bimodal (but not unimodal) stimulation reduced physiological and behavioral evidence of tinnitus in the guinea pigs after 25 days. Next, we applied the same bimodal treatment to 20 human subjects with tinnitus using a double-blinded, sham-controlled, crossover study. Twenty-eight days of LTD-inducing bimodal stimulation reduced tinnitus loudness and intrusiveness. Unimodal auditory stimulation did not deliver either benefit.

We sought to examine the potential mediating role of negative affect, message reactance (ie, an oppositional reaction to a message) and perceived risk in shaping quit intentions. In 2014 and 2015, we randomly assigned 2149 adult US smokers to receive either pictorial warnings or text-only warnings applied to their cigarette packs for 4&#x2009;weeks. Analyses used structural equation modelling with bootstrapped SEs to test our theorised mediational model. Pictorial warnings increased negative affect, message reactance and quit intentions (all P&lt;0.001), but not perceived risk (ie, perceived likelihood and severity of harms of smoking). Negative affect mediated the impact of pictorial warnings on quit intentions (mediated effect=0.16, P&lt;0.001). Message reactance weakened the impact of pictorial warnings on quit intentions, although the effect was small (mediated effect=-0.04, P&lt;0.001). Although pictorial warnings did not directly influence perceived risk, the model showed additional small mediation effects on quit intentions through negative affect and its <i>positive</i> association with perceived risk (mediated effect=0.02, P&lt;0.001), as well as reactance and its <i>negative</i> association with perceived risk (mediated effect=-0.01, P&lt;0.001). Pictorial cigarette pack warnings increased quit intentions by increasing negative affect. Message reactance partially attenuated this increase in intentions.

An important, yet poorly explained epidemiological feature of NCDs is their low incidence in under developed areas of low-income countries and rising rates in urban areas. With the goal of better understanding how urbanization increases the incidence of NCDs, we provide an overview of the urbanization process in sub-Saharan Africa, discuss gene expression differences between rural and urban populations, and review the current NCD determinant model. We conclude by identifying research priorities. Declining rates of chronic and recurrent infection are the hallmark of urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa. Gene profiling studies show urbanization results in complex molecular changes, with almost one-third of the peripheral blood leukocyte transcriptome altered. The current NCD determinant model could be improved by including a possible effect from declining rates of infection and expanding the spectrum of diseases that increase with urbanization. Urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa provides a unique opportunity to investigate the mechanism by which the environment influences disease epidemiology. Research priorities include: (1) studies to define the relationship between infection and risk factors for NCDs, (2) explaining the observed differences in the inflammatory response between rural and urban populations, and (3) identification of animal models that simulate the biological changes that occurs with urbanization. A better understanding of the biological changes that occur with urbanization could lead to new prevention and treatment strategies for some of the most common surgical diseases in high-income countries.",2018,6,1,"World journal of surgery","10.1007/s00268-017-4389-5","PMC5935558","World J Surg","eng","D017954; D002648; D002908; D003906; D015870; D006801; D015994; D007239; D000073296; D011203; D012008; D012307; D012424; D014505; D014507","Africa South of the Sahara; Child; Chronic Disease; Developing Countries; Gene Expression; Humans; Incidence; Infections; Noncommunicable Diseases; Poverty; Recurrence; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Urban Population; Urbanization","R24 TW008910","NA","<b>Financial Conflicts:</b> None. <b>Conflicts of Interest:</b> None","Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, University of California, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA."
"29228912","The association between neighbourhood-level deprivation and depression: evidence from the south african national income dynamics study.","Nicholas Dowdall, Catherine L Ward, Crick Lund","Depression contributes substantially to the burden of disease in South Africa. Little is known about how neighbourhoods affect the mental health of the people living in them. Using nationally representative data (N=11,955) from the South African National Income Dynamics Study and the South African Indices of Multiple Deprivation (SAIMD) modelled at small-area level, this study tested associations between neighbourhood-level deprivation and depression, after controlling for individual-level covariates. Results showed a significant positive association between neighbourhood-level deprivation and depression using the composite SAIMD (&#x3b2; = 0.31 (0.15); p=0.04) as well as the separate deprivation domains. Living environment deprivation (&#x3b2; =0.53 (0.16); p=0.001) and employment deprivation (&#x3b2; = 0.38 (0.13); p=0.004), respectively, were the two most salient domains in predicting this relationship. Findings supported the hypothesis that there is a positive association between living in a more deprived neighbourhood and depression, even after controlling for individual-level covariates.

Regression with manifold responses has wide applications in shape analysis, neuroscience, medical imaging and many other areas. Our approach embeds the manifold where the responses lie onto a higher dimensional Euclidean space, obtains a local regression estimate in that space, and then projects this estimate back onto the image of the manifold. Outside the regression setting both intrinsic and extrinsic approaches have been proposed for modeling i.i.d manifold-valued data. However, to our knowledge our work is the first to take an extrinsic approach to the regression problem. The proposed extrinsic regression framework is general, computationally efficient and theoretically appealing. Asymptotic distributions and convergence rates of the extrinsic regression estimates are derived and a large class of examples are considered indicating the wide applicability of our approach.",2017,1,1,"Journal of the American Statistical Association","10.1080/01621459.2016.1208615","PMC5722259","J Am Stat Assoc","eng",NA,NA,"NSF IIS1546331.; DMS-1127914; R01 MH086633; R01 ES017240; DMS-1407655; UL1 TR001111; SES-1357666","NA",NA,"Department of Statistical Science, Duke University, Durham, NC."

Yet most extant samples are small or based upon low-risk populations, and few studies address the potential role of maternal weight during pregnancy in their study designs or sampling strategy. Here we report basal and reactivity levels of salivary cortisol within a racially and ethnically diverse sample of 132 infants approximately one month of age (Age in days: M=37.61, SD=7.27) born to lower income overweight or obese mothers. Reactivity was assessed in response to a multi-domain infant stressor paradigm, which included assessment via the Newborn Behavioral Observation (NBO) system and extensive anthropometric measurements. Sample means for basal, post stressors, and reactivity to the NBO were significantly lower than those reported in reviews of low-risk samples. Parity was associated with cortisol levels such that first-born infants had lower resting cortisol and higher reactivity than infants born to multiparous women. Latino infants had lower basal cortisol. No other demographic characteristics significantly predicted cortisol. The variability in cortisol levels present in this sample suggests that considerable psychophysiological diversity may exist in samples of low-SES or high-risk participants.

Wireless transmission has the advantage of removing the wires between the animal and the recording equipment but is hampered by the large number of data to be sent at a relatively high rate. To reduce transmission bandwidth, we propose an encoder/decoder scheme based on adaptive non-uniform quantization. Our algorithm uses the current transmitted codeword to adapt the quantization intervals to changing statistics in LFP signals. It is thus backward adaptive and does not require the sending of side information. The computational complexity is low and similar at the encoder and decoder sides. These features allow for real-time signal recovery and facilitate hardware implementation with low-cost commercial microcontrollers. As proof-of-concept, we developed an open-source neural recording device called NeRD. The NeRD prototype digitally transmits eight channels encoded at 10&#x2009;kHz with 2 bits per sample. It occupies a volume of 2&#x2009;&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;&#x2009;2&#x2009;&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;&#x2009;2&#x2009;cm<sup>3</sup> and weighs 8&#x2009;g with a small battery allowing for 2&#x2009;h 40&#x2009;min of autonomy. The power dissipation is 59.4 mW for a communication range of 8 m and transmission losses below 0.1%. The small weight and low power consumption offer the possibility of mounting the entire device on the head of a rodent without resorting to a separate head-stage and battery backpack. The NeRD prototype is validated in recording LFPs in freely moving rats at 2 bits per sample while maintaining an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (&gt;30 dB) over a range of noisy channels. Adaptive quantization in neural implants allows for lower transmission bandwidths while retaining high signal fidelity and preserving fundamental frequencies in LFPs.",2018,4,1,"Journal of neural engineering","10.1088/1741-2552/aaa041",NA,"J Neural Eng","eng","D000222; D000818; D001921; D004567; D004867; D008297; D009474; D051381; D017207; D013686; D059015","Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Brain; Electrodes, Implanted; Equipment Design; Male; Neurons; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Telemetry; Wireless Technology",NA,"NA",NA,"Laboratoire Lorrain de Recherche en Informatique et ses Applications (LORIA), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), UMR7503, Vand&#x153;uvre-l&#xe8;s-Nancy, France."
"29213232","Stress-Induced Chronic Visceral Pain of Gastrointestinal Origin.","Beverley Greenwood-Van Meerveld, Anthony C Johnson","Visceral pain is generally poorly localized and characterized by hypersensitivity to a stimulus such as organ distension. In concert with chronic visceral pain, there is a high comorbidity with stress-related psychiatric disorders including anxiety and depression. The mechanisms linking visceral pain with these overlapping comorbidities remain to be elucidated. Evidence suggests that long term stress facilitates pain perception and sensitizes pain pathways, leading to a feed-forward cycle promoting chronic visceral pain disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Early life stress (ELS) is a risk-factor for the development of IBS, however the mechanisms responsible for the persistent effects of ELS on visceral perception in adulthood remain incompletely understood. In rodent models, stress in adult animals induced by restraint and water avoidance has been employed to investigate the mechanisms of stress-induce pain. ELS models such as maternal separation, limited nesting, or odor-shock conditioning, which attempt to model early childhood experiences such as neglect, poverty, or an abusive caregiver, can produce chronic, sexually dimorphic increases in visceral sensitivity in adulthood. Chronic visceral pain is a classic example of gene &#xd7; environment interaction which results from maladaptive changes in neuronal circuitry leading to neuroplasticity and aberrant neuronal activity-induced signaling. One potential mechanism underlying the persistent effects of stress on visceral sensitivity could be epigenetic modulation of gene expression. While there are relatively few studies examining epigenetically mediated mechanisms involved in visceral nociception, stress-induced visceral pain has been linked to alterations in DNA methylation and histone acetylation patterns within the brain, leading to increased expression of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters. This review will discuss the potential neuronal pathways and mechanisms responsible for stress-induced exacerbation of chronic visceral pain. Additionally, we will review the importance of specific experimental models of adult stress and ELS in enhancing our understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms of pain processing.",2017,1,1,"Frontiers in systems neuroscience","10.3389/fnsys.2017.00086","PMC5702626","Front Syst Neurosci","eng",NA,NA,"I01 BX001195; I01 BX002188; IK2 BX003630; IK6 BX003610","10.1152/ajprenal.00297.2015; 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2010.04409.x; 10.1016/j.pain.2008.12.007; 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2011.01865.x; 10.1111/nmo.12154; 10.1111/nmo.13081; 10.1016/j.pain.2004.10.002; 10.1136/gut.2005.084194; 10.1111/bph.13352; 10.1111/bph.13348; 10.1111/bph.13355; 10.1111/bph.13350; 10.1016/j.brainres.2003.10.073; 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2005.12.002; 10.1016/S0306-4522(99)00445-5; 10.1007/s00406-005-0624-4; 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2011.01805.x; 10.1097/01.ASW.0000358637.38161.8f; 10.1007/s00418-013-1081-1; 10.1046/j.1365-2826.2001.00698.x; 10.1053/j.gastro.2016.02.028; 10.1111/nmo.13148; 10.1093/brain/awr288; 10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.033; 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.06.004; 10.1046/j.1365-2982.2002.00305.x; 10.1371/journal.pone.0130938; 10.1053/j.gastro.2006.01.037; 10.1016/j.pain.2006.10.028; 10.1152/ajpgi.90557.2008; 10.1152/ajpgi.00500.2004; 10.1016/j.cgh.2011.12.018; 10.1016/j.neuron.2014.01.018; 10.1152/ajpgi.00437.2016; 10.1038/nrgastro.2013.29; 10.1038/nrn3516; 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2009.04.003; 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2012.01921.x; 10.1002/dev.420210103; 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307748; 10.1177/1744806916660722; 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-310971; 10.1016/j.jpain.2012.11.008; 10.1053/j.gastro.2005.09.071; 10.1007/s10620-008-0575-5; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.06.024; 10.1152/ajpgi.00240.2001; 10.1016/0006-8993(95)00525-U; 10.1152/ajpgi.00290.2013; 10.1111/jam.13320; 10.1038/nrn1683; 10.1038/nn.3628; 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2007.05987.x; 10.1097/ALN.0b013e3182700383; 10.1016/0145-2134(96)00091-9; 10.1038/ajg.2011.201; 10.7326/0003-4819-113-11-828; 10.1016/j.bcp.2004.06.037; 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2009.01385.x; 10.1210/en.2010-0285; 10.1126/science.1121158; 10.1111/nmo.12272; 10.1371/journal.pone.0085073; 10.1046/j.1365-2982.2003.00420.x; 10.2165/11630070-000000000-00000; 10.1016/j.yexmp.2014.04.009; 10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.11.075; 10.1111/nmo.12458; 10.1016/0887-8994(96)00153-1; 10.1002/da.20605; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.12.002; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.03.004; 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2008.12.007; 10.1038/nri3621; 10.1016/S0006-8993(00)03305-9; 10.1152/ajpgi.00463.2014; 10.1016/B978-0-12-803239-8.00041-7; 10.1038/srep07642; 10.1016/j.brainres.2007.08.030; 10.1046/j.1365-2982.1997.d01-63.x; 10.1016/j.yfrne.2014.06.001; 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000089; 10.1152/ajpgi.00349.2010; 10.1016/j.yfrne.2007.10.004; 10.1210/en.2011-1470; 10.1006/hbeh.1994.1044; 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2008.12.009; 10.1016/j.genm.2009.03.004; 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2008.02.020; 10.1016/S0166-2236(96)10069-2; 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2009.11.001; 10.1002/ejp.847; 10.1016/j.ynstr.2015.12.003; 10.1136/gut.2008.157594; 10.1053/j.gastro.2014.09.032; 10.1053/j.gastro.2010.11.003; 10.1016/j.mayocp.2016.04.029; 10.1016/j.nicl.2017.06.001; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.04.019; 10.1016/j.brainres.2011.01.002; 10.1152/jn.00135.2007; 10.1152/jn.01148.2007; 10.1111/nmo.12549; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.04.070; 10.3748/wjg.v19.i22.3487; 10.4172/2157-7536.1000e109; 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2015.01.018; 10.1007/164_2016_120; 10.1371/journal.pone.0008573; 10.1038/tp.2015.16; 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2012.01899.x; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.06.050; 10.1111/bph.13740; 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2016.11.016; 10.1111/j.1572-0241.1998.540_i.x; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2017.01.021; 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2017.08.023; 10.1073/pnas.0507572102; 10.1016/S0006-8993(96)01108-0; 10.1038/nm.2231; 10.1016/S0022-3999(02)00399-9; 10.1152/ajpgi.00072.2009; 10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.11.045; 10.1037/a0019712; 10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.11.102; 10.1124/jpet.115.231670; 10.3748/wjg.v21.i23.7181; 10.1186/s13041-015-0169-z; 10.1111/nmo.13170; 10.1124/pr.58.4.9; 10.1111/ejn.12440; 10.1159/000375454; 10.1016/j.clinph.2014.10.004; 10.1111/j.1526-4610.2012.02209.x; 10.1007/s00210-017-1384-1; 10.3748/wjg.v21.i3.836; 10.1038/sj.npp.1301200; 10.3748/wjg.v20.i22.6725; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5540-03.2004; 10.1136/gut.2004.051391; 10.1371/journal.pone.0073749; 10.1038/srep19399; 10.1007/s40272-014-0080-6; 10.12980/APJTB.4.2014C205; 10.1073/pnas.0705615105; 10.1111/nmo.12675; 10.1016/j.brainres.2011.12.049; 10.1037/0735-7044.118.2.274; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0499-06.2006; 10.2147/JPR.S60433",NA,"VA Medical Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States."

Evidence of DNA-methylation differences by SES suggests a possible association of SES with epigenetic age acceleration (AA). We investigated the association of SES with AA in more than 5,000 individuals belonging to three independent prospective cohorts from Italy, Australia, and Ireland.

The results were consistent across different SES indicators. The associations were only partially modulated by the unhealthy lifestyle habits of individuals with lower SES. Individuals who experienced life-course SES improvement had intermediate AA compared to extreme SES categories, suggesting reversibility of the effect and supporting the relative importance of the early childhood social environment.

We examine this gap by socio-economic status (SES; indicated by family income and respondent education) and service sector in a cross-national analysis of community epidemiological survey data. Data come from 16 753 respondents with 12-month DSM-IV disorders from community surveys in 25 countries in the WHO World Mental Health Survey Initiative. DSM-IV anxiety, mood, or substance disorders and treatment of these disorders were assessed with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Only 13.7% of 12-month DSM-IV/CIDI cases in lower-middle-income countries, 22.0% in upper-middle-income countries, and 36.8% in high-income countries received treatment. Highest-SES respondents were somewhat more likely to receive treatment, but this was true mostly for specialty mental health treatment, where the association was positive with education (highest treatment among respondents with the highest education and a weak association of education with treatment among other respondents) but non-monotonic with income (somewhat lower treatment rates among middle-income respondents and equivalent among those with high and low incomes). The modest, but nonetheless stronger, an association of education than income with treatment raises questions about a financial barriers interpretation of the inverse association of SES with treatment, although future within-country analyses that consider contextual factors might document other important specifications.

Thus, we investigated this association among adults aged &#x2265;50 years across six LMICs. A cross-sectional analysis using data from the World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa) was conducted. A perceived stress score [range 0 (lowest stress) -100 (highest stress)] was computed based on two questions from the Perceived Stress Scale. Thirteen chronic conditions were assessed. Multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted. 34,129 adults with a mean age of 62.4 (SD=16.0)years (52.1% females) were included. Overall, 56.6% (95% CI=55.0%-58.2%) had multimorbidity. In the adjusted model including all countries, compared with those with no chronic conditions, higher numbers of chronic conditions were significantly associated with higher stress levels, dose dependently. In a countrywide meta-analysis, multimorbidity was associated with significantly higher stress levels in all countries (especially India and Ghana) although characterized by moderate heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>=54.6%). For single chronic conditions, notably high stress scores were observed for depression, stroke, and hearing problems. Chronic conditions and multimorbidity are associated with higher levels of stress in older adults in LMICs.

In this hospital-based follow-up study, the main aim was to examine white matter microstructure and its relationship to fine and gross motor function in 31 VLBW young adults without cerebral palsy compared with 31 term-born controls, at mean age 22.6&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.7&#xa0;years. The participants were examined with tests of fine and gross motor function (Trail Making Test-5: TMT-5, Grooved Pegboard, Triangle from Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2: MABC-2 and High-level Mobility Assessment Tool: HiMAT) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Probabilistic tractography of motor pathways of the corticospinal tract (CST) and corpus callosum (CC) was performed. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated in non-crossing (capsula interna in CST, body of CC) and crossing (centrum semiovale) fibre regions along the tracts and examined for group differences. Associations between motor test scores and FA in the CST and CC were investigated with linear regression. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was used to examine group differences in DTI metrics in all major white matter tracts. The VLBW group had lower scores on all motor tests compared with controls, however, only statistically significant for TMT-5. Based on tractography, FA in the VLBW group was lower in non-crossing fibre regions and higher in crossing fibre regions of the CST compared with controls. Within the VLBW group, poorer fine motor function was associated with higher FA in crossing fibre regions of the CST, and poorer bimanual coordination was additionally associated with lower FA in crossing fibre regions of the CC. Poorer gross motor function was associated with lower FA in crossing fibre regions of the CST and CC. There were no associations between motor function and FA in non-crossing fibre regions of the CST and CC within the VLBW group. In the TBSS analysis, the VLBW group had lower FA and higher mean diffusivity compared with controls in all major white matter tracts. The findings in this study may indicate that the associations between motor function and FA are caused by other tracts crossing the CST and CC, and/or by alterations in the periventricular white matter in the centrum semiovale. Some of the associations were in the opposite direction than hypothesized, thus higher FA does not always indicate better function. Furthermore, widespread white matter alterations in VLBW individuals persist into young adulthood.",2018,1,1,"NeuroImage.

A cross-country qualitative study was conducted, interviewing 83 stakeholders of mental health services. Our analysis showed that service user and caregiver involvement in the health system strengthening process was an alien concept for most participants. They reported very limited access to direct participation. Stigma and poverty were described as the main barriers for involvement. Several strategies were identified by participants to overcome existing hurdles to facilitate service user and caregiver involvement in the mental health system strengthening process, such as support to access treatment, mental health promotion and empowerment of service users. This study suggests that capacity building for service users, and strengthening of user groups would equip them to contribute meaningfully to policy development from informed perspectives. Involvement of service users and their caregivers in mental health decision-making is still in its infancy in LMICs. Effective strategies are required to overcome existing barriers, for example making funding more widely available for Ph.D. studies in participatory research with service users and caregivers to develop, implement and evaluate approaches to involvement that are locally and culturally acceptable in LMICs.",2018,2,1,"Epidemiology and psychiatric sciences","10.1017/S2045796017000634","PMC6998885","Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci","eng","D017028; D003430; D003906; D005260; D006282; D006297; D006801; D007407; D008297; D001523; D008603; D008605; D010342; D010358; D011203; D011320; D036301","Caregivers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Developing Countries; Female; Health Personnel; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Patient Participation; Poverty; Primary Health Care; Qualitative Research",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Psychiatry,Addis Ababa University,College of Health Sciences,School of Medicine,Addis Ababa,Ethiopia."

Women of lower socioeconomic status (SES) are less compliant to recommended prenatal care and suffer a higher risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. Several attempts to encourage optimal pregnancy follow-up have shown controversial results, particularly in high-income countries. Few studies have assessed financial incentives to encourage prenatal care, and none reported materno-fetal events as the primary outcome. Our study aims to determine whether financial incentives could improve pregnancy outcomes in women with low SES in a high-income country. This pragmatic cluster-randomised clinical trial includes pregnant women with the following criteria: (1) age above 18 years, (2) first pregnancy visit before 26 weeks of gestation and (3) belonging to a socioeconomically disadvantaged group. The intervention consists in offering financial incentives conditional on attending scheduled pregnancy follow-up consultations. Clusters are 2-month periods with random turnover across centres. A composite outcome of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality is the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include maternal or neonatal outcomes assessed separately, qualitative assessment of the perception of the intervention and cost-effectiveness analysis for which children will be followed to the end of their first year through the French health insurance database. The study started in June 2016, and based on an expected decrease in the primary endpoint from 18% to 14% in the intervention group, we plan to include 2000 women in each group. Ethics approval was first gained on 28 September 2014. An independent data security and monitoring committee has been established.

In this paper, we provide an overview of the neuroscience of SES, with a focus on three key sets of findings. First, lower SES is linked to greater attunement to others. Second, lower SES is associated with holistic cognitive styles. Third, lower SES is linked to greater reactivity to threat.

"29072182","Social challenges of contemporary psychiatry.","N Bouras","Psychiatry and society are interrelated and the biopsychosocial model continues to dominate the clinical psychiatric practice. Some doubts have been expressed in recent years about the value and the wide acceptance of the biopsychosocial model. Ghaemi (2009)1 considers it to be anti-humanistic and advocates the use of less eclectic, less generic, and less vague alternatives. The fundamental changes that have been witnessed in our times across the spectrum of biology, psychology and sociology have made necessary that a conceptual clarity should prevail. The remarkable advances in neurosciences, neurobiology and genetics tend to swing the emphasis towards a more biological basis. Psychosis for example is the condition often regarded as being biologically constructed and most independent of the social context. The symptoms, however, of hallucinations and delusions in psychosis have social meaning for the person experiencing them and are primarily defined socially.2 Furthermore, vulnerability is often the result of social trauma, whether in the form of recent stressors that trigger onset, or earlier circumstances that shape cognitive and emotional style. Moreover, the approved treatment and management of long term psychiatric disorders has involved interventions that are either directly social, or psychosocial. Furthermore, doubts have also been raised by the endophenotype project,3 related to the genetics of schizophrenia. Cohen4 suggested that there may be more individual genotypic patterns associated with schizophrenia than people with schizophrenia on the planet. A recent alternative interpretation (network approach) is gaining some support. It suggests that a stressor causes symptoms that activate other symptoms, in a circular, self-reinforcing way.5 This theory moves away from psychiatric disorders being traditionally conceptualised as categorical or dimensional models. While psychiatry has shifted its focus to a more biological approach, social factors still have an important role in crosscultural diagnosis, psychiatric disorders relating to social deprivation, rehabilitation and enabling social inclusion. The degree to which society is willing to accept people with mental health problems has an obvious impact on their quality of life. We live in a period of cataclysmic social changes with disastrous wars, increased poverty and growing income inequality. The consequences on mental health are phenomenal with epidemics of self-harm and suicidality, higher rates of depression, and intensifying diagnosis of mood and conduct disorders in children and young adults. Other adversities include the disproportional number of people with mental health problems in prisons and penal institutions, the massive escalation of dementia sufferers and the shortcomings of the aspirations of community mental health care. In addition, there is an escalating social pathology with significant numbers of refugees and asylum seekers and rising numbers of homeless particularly in urban areas of the developed world. We should not, however, overlook the better rates of treatment for mental health problems, the emphasis on human rights, the empowerment and the service users' participation and the development in global mental health. All these social factors are important to contemporary psychiatry presenting complex challenges and demanding urgent attention and action.6 There is a need to embrace the development of evidence-based mental health services and a pluralistic approach, which balances appropriately the relevance of biological, psychological and social factors associated with mental health problems. The concept Meta-Community mental health builds on the successes of biological, psychological, social and community psychiatry.7 It incorporates neurosciences, sociology, psychology and anthropology and is delivered wherever the evidence shows that it makes a difference, whether in community or hospital, prisons, schools, court-room, place of work, refugee camp or battle-front. New technologies should be included for public information and education together with e-mental health, training of providers, tele-psychiatry and self-help methods delivered via IT. The boundaries of mental health are enlarging very rapidly and indeed new stakeholders and partners should be welcomed. This opens exciting possibilities but also creates some risks and strong evidence base should continue to guide us. Likelihood of finding early diagnostic and individualized treatment for psychosis, autism and dementia are likely to be of high financial cost. The importance of the social challenges of modern psychiatry was recognised by including mental health for the first time in the New Sustainable Development Goals of United Nations that will determine the global development by 2030 aiming at the promotion of life expectancy for all.8 Strengthening the prevention and treatment of mental health problems is a massive task for sustainable development as mental health has a direct impact on the whole range of Sustainable Development Goals.",2017,1,1,"Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki","10.22365/jpsych.2017.283.199",NA,"Psychiatriki","eng","D006115; D006801; D011570; D011618; D012559; D012944","Greece; Humans; Psychiatry; Psychotic Disorders; Schizophrenia; Social Support",NA,"NA",NA,"Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry-King's College, London, UK."

However, a paucity of multinational studies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), has investigated correlates of physical activity (PA). Thus, we assessed the correlates of PA using cross-sectional, community-based data of the World Health Survey including 46 LMICs.

Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the PA correlates. The prevalence of low PA in 206,356 persons (mean age 38.4years; 49.6% males) was 29.2% (95%CI=28.3%-30.0%). In the overall sample, female sex, not married/cohabiting, high education and wealth, unemployment, and urban setting were significant sociodemographic correlates of low PA. In terms of other correlates, inadequate fruit and vegetable intake, subsyndromal depression, worse sleep/energy and cognition, visual impairment, hearing problems and asthma were associated with not meeting the WHO recommendations. There were some variations in the correlates depending on age and sex. Interventions should be developed that operate at multiple levels of influence and take into account age- and gender-related PA patterns in order to assist people in LMICs to comply with the WHO PA recommendations.

Symptomatic raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure can be treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion (VPS). In HIV-infected patients however, there is a concern that VPS might be associated with unacceptably high rates of mortality. We aim to systematically review and appraise published literature to determine reported outcomes and identify predictors of outcome following VPS in relevant subgroups of HIV-infected adults. The following electronic databases will be searched: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), LILACS (BIREME), Research Registry ( www.researchregistry.com ), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) ( www.controlled-trials.com ), ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) and OpenSIGLE database. Any randomised studies, cohort studies, case-control studies, interrupted time series or sequential case series reporting survival following VPS in HIV-infected individuals will be included. If high-quality homogenous studies exist, meta-analysis will be conducted to determine 1-, 6- and 12-month mortality with comparison made between underlying aetiologies of hydrocephalus. This study will generate a comprehensive review of VPS in HIV-infected patients for publication. The primary outcome of meta-analysis is 12-month survival. If only low-quality, heterogeneous studies are available, this study will demonstrate this deficiency and will be of value in justifying and aiding the design of future studies.

Little is known about whether text messaging parents of children enrolled in obesity treatment will improve child health. We conducted a 2-group randomized controlled study among 101 children aged 5-12 and their parent/guardian enrolling in tertiary-care obesity treatment. Participants were randomized to standard care or standard care plus daily motivational interviewing-based text messages. The primary outcome was change in child BMI at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included feasibility, health behaviors, attrition, motivation, and parent BMI. We enrolled 101 parent-child dyads and retained 81% to 3-month follow-up. Child participants had a mean age of 9.9 years, and baseline BMI of 30.5&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Half (48%) of participants were Black, and 64% of parent participants had a high school equivalent education or less. Ninety-nine percent of parents owned a mobile device with unlimited text messaging. Parents responded to 80% of texts, and 95% felt the texts ""always"" or ""almost always"" helped them make a good health decision. We observed no between-group difference in child zBMI from baseline to 3 months (0.0 vs. 0.2, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.2). Intervention participants had significantly better adherence to clinic visits (3.3 visits vs. 2.1 visits/3 months, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Parent-directed text messages did not significantly change child BMI. However, texting significantly reduced attrition for treatment visits.

Here, we examined the association between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and ASD risk at 7&#xa0;years of age using the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), a representative cohort of 13,192 children born in the UK from 2000 to 2001. We also sought to examine cytokine expression in the serum of women with pre-eclampsia, which is the most common HDP, and whether exposure of foetal neurons to this serum could change patterns of neuronal growth. HDP were reported by mothers 9&#xa0;months post-delivery. ASD was parent reported at age seven, based on a doctor or health care professional's diagnosis. Weighted logistic regression was used for data analysis, adjusting for several potential confounders including maternal alcohol consumption, education, depression, age, and poverty status. Sensitivity analyses were performed excluding pre-term births, small for gestational age (SGA), and pre-pregnancy hypertension and depression. There was a significant association between HDP and a twofold increased risk of ASD (AOR&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.10 [95% CI 1.20-3.70]). Excluding preterm births, SGA births, and offspring of women who had pre-pregnancy hypertension or over the age of 40 did not change the results materially. At the cellular level, exposure of foetal cortical neurons to 3% serum isolated from women with an established HDP increased neuronal growth and branching in vitro.

"28933882","Maternal depressive symptoms, mother-child interactions, and children's executive function.","Noa Gueron-Sela, Marie Camerota, Michael T Willoughby, Lynne Vernon-Feagans, Martha J Cox","This study examined the independent and mediated associations between maternal depression symptoms (MDS), mother-child interaction, and child executive function (EF) in a prospective longitudinal sample of 1,037 children (50% boys) from predominantly low-income and rural communities. When children were 6, 15 and 24 months of age, mothers reported their level of depressive symptomatology. At 24 and 36 months of age, mother-child interactions during play were rated for warmth-sensitivity and harsh-intrusiveness, and dyadic joint attention and maternal language complexity were assessed from a book sharing activity. Children's EF (i.e., inhibitory control, working memory, and set shifting) were assessed at ages 36 and 48 months using a battery of six tasks. Results indicated that MDS at ages 15 and 24 months were negatively associated with children's EF at age 48 months. Additionally, harsh-intrusive mother-child interactions partially mediated this link. Although warmth-sensitivity, dyadic joint attention and maternal language complexity were all longitudinally related to EF, they did not serve as mediating mechanisms between MDS and EF. These results were obtained while controlling for multiple demographic factors, children's earlier cognitive abilities, maternal general distress and childcare experiences. Findings from this study identify 1 mechanism through which early exposure to MDS could be related to children's EF.

However, the safety and efficacy of cooling therapy in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where 99% of the disease burden occurs, remains unclear. We will examine whether whole body cooling reduces death or neurodisability at 18-22 months after neonatal encephalopathy, in LMICs. We will randomly allocate 408 term or near-term babies (aged&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;6&#xa0;h) with moderate or severe neonatal encephalopathy admitted to public sector neonatal units in LMIC countries (India, Bangladesh or Sri Lanka), to either usual care alone or whole-body cooling with usual care. Babies allocated to the cooling arm will have core body temperature maintained at 33.5&#xa0;&#xb0;C using a servo-controlled cooling device for 72&#xa0;h, followed by re-warming at 0.5&#xa0;&#xb0;C per hour. All babies will have detailed infection screening at the time of recruitment and 3 Telsa cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy at 1-2 weeks after birth.

In the present study, we investigated the converse issue, namely whether and how reading acquisition is constrained by the anatomy of the brain. Using multimodal MRI, we found that (a) the pattern (continuous or interrupted sulcus) of the posterior part of the left lateral occipito-temporal sulcus (OTS) hosting the visual word form area (VWFA) predicts reading skills in adults; that (b) this effect is modulated by the age of reading acquisition; and that (c) the length of the OTS sulcal interruption is associated with reading skills.

The study includes 3,913 men and 4,803 women aged 20-72 who participated in the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health (SLOSH). The respondents were divided into three groups depending on frequency of MBE practice (never/seldom/often). Measures regarding MBE practice, health behaviors, self-rated health, and illnesses were drawn from the SLOSH questionnaire, while more objective measures of socioeconomic status and education were derived from registry data. In addition, data on purchases of prescription drugs for all respondents were included in the study. These data were obtained from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, which contains information about prescription drugs dispensed at Swedish pharmacies. Separate analyses were performed for mental MBE (mindfulness, meditation, relaxation techniques) and physical MBE (yoga, Tai Chi, Qi Gong), respectively. A high intensity MBE practice is cross-sectionally related to poor self-assessed health (sleeping problems, pain, depressive symptoms, mental disorders), high levels of stress, and high levels of purchases of psychotropic drugs and analgesics. These cross-sectional relationships are generally stronger for mental MBE than for bodily-directed MBE. More women than men are practicing MBE on a regular basis, and physically active people participate to a greater extent in MBE compared with the physically inactive. Overall, the study shows that frequent participation in mind and body exercises is associated with high levels of purchases of psychotropic drugs and analgesics as well as with poor self-assessed health and high levels of stress. However, since this is a cross-sectional study, it is impossible to establish cause and effect, and to further investigate the associations found; longitudinal studies that can account for temporality between covariates and MBE use are needed.",2017,1,1,"PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0184635","PMC5600368","PLoS One","eng","D000293; D000328; D000368; D000700; D003430; D005260; D005500; D006801; D008297; D008875; D026441; D015995; D011619; D012042; D012647; D012959; D013548","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Analgesics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mind-Body Therapies; Prevalence; Psychotropic Drugs; Registries; Self-Assessment; Socioeconomic Factors; Sweden",NA,"10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.13018; 10.1037/a0020146; 10.1016/j.psychres.2010.08.011; 10.1037/a0018555; 10.1002/da.21964; 10.1016/j.cpr.2011.05.002; 10.3310/hta19730; 10.1002/da.22166; 10.1016/j.jad.2005.08.013; 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11040090; 10.1097/01.pra.0000367775.88388.96; 10.1016/j.ctcp.2010.09.007; 10.1016/j.jpain.2011.10.001; 10.1097/AJP.0b013e31825e1492; 10.1186/1472-6882-10-23; 10.1002/da.10106; 10.1016/j.jad.2013.05.042; 10.1016/j.psym.2011.11.009; 10.1007/s10654-010-9521-x; 10.1093/eurpub/cks064; 10.1093/occmed/kqu058; 10.1186/1471-2458-11-130; 10.1186/1478-7954-4-8; 10.5665/SLEEP.1288; 10.1007/s00420-009-0406-9; 10.5271/sjweh.3378; 10.5665/sleep.4828; 10.1371/journal.pone.0060637; 10.1097/MLR.0b013e31817a835d; 10.1016/j.jad.2014.10.062; 10.1111/j.1742-7843.2009.00494.x","<b>Competing Interests: </b>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."

Laquinimod is in clinical development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and Huntington Disease (HD). The objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and cytoimmunologic effects following escalating doses of laquinimod in patients with RRMS. One hundred twelve patients were randomly assigned to laquinimod/placebo in a series of separate dose-escalating cohorts starting from a daily oral dose of 0.9&#xa0;mg/1.2&#xa0;mg escalating to 2.7&#xa0;mg, in 0.3&#xa0;mg increments. Twenty-eight patients received placebo and 84 received laquinimod ranging from 0.9 to 2.7&#xa0;mg. No deaths occurred. One serious adverse event (SAE) of perichondritis was reported, which was unrelated to laquinimod (0.9&#xa0;mg). There was no increased incidence of adverse events (AEs) with escalating doses. Laquinimod-treated patients showed more abnormal laboratory levels in liver enzymes, P-amylase, C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen, but most shifts were clinically non-significant. The exposure of laquinimod was dose proportional and linear in the tested dose range. An immunological substudy showed significant dose-dependent decreases in 6-sulpho LacNAc + dendritic cell (slanDC) frequency following laquinimod compared to placebo. Laquinimod doses up to 2.7&#xa0;mg were safely administered to patients with RRMS. An in vivo effect of laquinimod on the innate immune system was demonstrated. EudraCT Number: 2009-011234-99 .

"28851421","Engaging and staying engaged: a phenomenological study of barriers to equitable access to mental healthcare for people with severe mental disorders in a rural African setting.","Maji Hailemariam, Abebaw Fekadu, Martin Prince, Charlotte Hanlon","In low-and middle-income countries, integration of mental health into primary care is recommended to reduce the treatment gap. In this study we explored barriers to initial and ongoing engagement of people with severe mental disorders (SMD) in rural Ethiopia after implementing integrated primary mental healthcare services. A qualitative approach was employed. In-depth interviews were conducted with 50 key informants: service users/caregivers engaged with care (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17), non-engagers and their caregivers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;10), those who had initiated treatment but disengaged and their caregivers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;12) and primary healthcare professionals (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11). Two focus group discussions were conducted with community health workers (10 per group). Thematic analysis was used. Most respondents reported improved access to care, usually equated with medication, and were motivated to remain engaged due to experienced benefits of care. However, four main barriers to engagement emerged. (1) Poverty: resulting in inability to pay for medication and undermining vital social support affected engagement for all respondents. (2) Unreliable medication supplies and lack of second line options for inadequate response or intolerable side-effects. (3) The long-term nature of the illness: expectations of cure, stigma of chronic illness, low awareness about the illness and treatment and declining social support over time. (4) The nature of SMD: difficulty conveying the person when acutely disturbed and no flexibility for proactive outreach or legal frameworks to provide care when patients lacked capacity. In those who never engaged, geographical inaccessibility was an important barrier. Alternative cultural explanations for illness were only mentioned as a barrier only by two of the respondents. Economic interventions may be needed to support ongoing engagement in care for people with SMD. Systems of care for chronic illness need to be strengthened in combination with legal frameworks. Expanded options for affordable and effective medication and psychosocial interventions are required for person-centred care.",2017,8,29,"International journal for equity in health","10.1186/s12939-017-0657-0","PMC5576237","Int J Equity Health","eng","D000293; D000328; D000368; D005002; D005260; D054625; D006801; D008297; D001523; D008605; D008875; D036301; D012424; D012959; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Ethiopia; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult",NA,"10.1093/schbul/sbp046; 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61404-X; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.07.057; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61093-3; 10.1080/18374905.2014.11081896; 10.1186/s12939-016-0410-0; 10.1177/160940690400300104; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1999.tb10687.x; 10.1016/j.jad.2005.03.011; 10.1186/s12875-017-0628-y; 10.1371/journal.pone.0126666; 10.1007/s10488-013-0528-y; 10.1186/1471-2288-8-73; 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.04.027; 10.1007/s00127-012-0587-5; 10.1093/heapol/czw084; 10.1371/journal.pone.0116897; 10.1001/jama.298.16.1900; 10.1093/heapol/czu142; 10.1093/wber/lhv009; 10.1016/S0306-9192(01)00014-8; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.08.044; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001166; 10.4314/ajpsy.v11i3.30227; 10.1017/S2045796015000803; 10.1186/s13063-016-1427-9; 10.1371/journal.pone.0143572; 10.1176/ps.2010.61.10.1028; 10.1007/s11013-012-9270-2; 10.1016/j.healthpol.2011.10.006; 10.1136/qshc.2004.010744; 10.1186/s12888-016-0981-8; 10.1093/heapol/czv072; 10.1186/s12913-016-1323-8; 10.1186/s12916-015-0309-4; 10.1186/1471-244X-11-165; 10.1016/S0140-6736(71)92410-X; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61458-X; 10.1016/j.ijlp.2013.11.024","ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the College of Health Sciences of Addis Ababa University.

To date, correlates of independent outdoor play have not been investigated. This study aimed to identify potential demographic, behavioural, environmental and social correlates of children's independent outdoor play. Data were from the Millennium Cohort Study when children were aged 7&#xa0;years. Parents reported whether their children played out unsupervised (yes/no) as well as the above mentioned correlates of unsupervised outdoor play. Children's physical activity levels were measured using waist worn accelerometry. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine associations between correlates and odds of independent (unsupervised) outdoor play. Adjusted multiple linear regression was used to estimate associations between independent outdoor play and objective measures of physical activity. Activity was measured as average daily moderate-to-vigorous activity, steps, and sedentary behaviour. 3856 (<i>n</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;29%) participants were categorised as engaging in independent outdoor play. Older age, being white British, being in poverty, living in close proximity to both family friends and family, having fewer internalising problems, having more externalising conduct problems and fewer pro-social behaviours were associated with higher odds of independent outdoor play. Independent outdoor play was associated with &gt;&#xa0;2 additional minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity (B&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.21 95% CI, 1.09 to 3.34), &gt;&#xa0;330 additional steps per day (B&#xa0;=&#xa0;336.66 95% CI 209.80 to 463.51), and nearly 5&#xa0;min less time spent sedentary per day (B&#xa0;=&#xa0;-&#xa0;4.91 95% CI -&#xa0;7.54, -&#xa0;2.29) Younger children, those from a higher socio-economic-status, those isolated in location from family friends and family, and those with high levels of prosocial behaviour have lower levels of independent outdoor play.

This study aimed to identify which young women are at the greatest risk of repeat unintended pregnancies; which interventions are effective and cost-effective; and what are the barriers to and facilitators for the uptake of these interventions. We conducted a mixed-methods systematic review which included meta-analysis, framework synthesis and application of realist principles, with stakeholder input and service user feedback to address this. We searched 20 electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica database, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts and Research Papers in Economics, to cover a broad range of health, social science, health economics and grey literature sources. Searches were conducted between May 2013 and June 2014 and updated in August 2015. Twelve randomised controlled trials (RCTs), two quasi-RCTs, 10 qualitative studies and 53 other quantitative studies were identified. The RCTs evaluated psychosocial interventions and an emergency contraception programme. The primary outcome was repeat conception rate: the event rate was 132 of 308 (43%) in the intervention group versus 140 of 289 (48%) for the control group, with a non-significant risk ratio (RR) of 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-1.08]. Four studies reported subsequent birth rates: 29 of 237 (12%) events for the intervention arm versus 46 out of 224 (21%) for the control arm, with an RR of 0.60 (95% CI 0.39-0.93). Many repeat conceptions occurred in the context of poverty, low expectations and aspirations and negligible opportunities. Qualitative and realist evidence highlighted the importance of context, motivation, future planning and giving young women a central and active role in the development of new interventions. Little or no evidence for the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of any of the interventions to reduce repeat pregnancy in young women was found. Qualitative and realist evidence helped to explain gaps in intervention design that should be addressed. More theory-based, rigorously evaluated programmes need to be developed to reduce unintended repeat pregnancy in young women. PROSPERO, CRD42012003168 .

Participation in screening is strongly associated with socioeconomic status. The aim of this study was to determine whether a supplementary leaflet providing the 'gist' of guaiac-based Faecal Occult Blood test (gFOBt) screening for colorectal cancer could reduce the socioeconomic status (SES) gradient in uptake in the English NHS BCSP. The trial was integrated within routine BCSP operations in November 2012. Using a cluster randomised controlled design all adults aged 59-74&#xa0;years who were being routinely invited to complete the gFOBt were randomised based on day of invitation. The Index of Multiple Deprivation was used to create SES quintiles. The control group received the standard information booklet ('SI'). The intervention group received the SI booklet and the Gist leaflet ('SI&#xa0;+&#xa0;Gist') which had been designed to help people with lower literacy engage with the invitation. Blinding of hubs was not possible and invited subjects were not made aware of a comparator condition. The primary outcome was the gradient in uptake across IMD quintiles. In November 2012, 163,525 individuals were allocated to either the 'SI' intervention (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;79,104) or the 'SI&#xa0;+&#xa0;Gist' group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;84,421). Overall uptake was similar between the intervention and control groups (SI: 57.3% and SI&#xa0;+&#xa0;Gist: 57.6%; OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.02, 95% CI: 0.92-1.13, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.77). Uptake was 42.0% (SI) vs. 43.0% (SI&#xa0;+&#xa0;Gist) in the most deprived quintile and 65.6% vs. 65.8% in the least deprived quintile (interaction p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.48). The SES gradient in uptake was similar between the study groups within age, gender, hub and screening round sub-groups. Providing supplementary simplified information in addition to the standard information booklet did not reduce the SES gradient in uptake in the NHS BCSP. The effectiveness of the Gist leaflet when used alone should be explored in future research.

"28803556","Buffering effects of safe, supportive, and nurturing relationships among women with childhood histories of maltreatment.","S R Jaffee, R Takizawa, L Arseneault","Adults who were victims of childhood maltreatment tend to have poorer health compared with adults who did not experience abuse. However, many are in good health. We tested whether safe, supportive, and nurturing relationships buffer women with a history of childhood maltreatment from poor health outcomes in later life. Participants included women from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study who were involved in an intimate relationship at some point by the time their twin children were 10 years old. Women were initially interviewed in 1999-2000 (mean age = 33 years) and 2, 5, and 7 years later. They reported on their physical and mental health, and their health-risk behaviours. Compared with women who did not experience abuse in childhood, women with histories of maltreatment were at elevated risk for mental, physical, and health-risk behaviours, including major depressive disorder, sleep, and substance use problems. Cumulatively, safe, supportive, and nurturing relationships characterized by a lack of violence, emotional intimacy, and social support buffered women with a history of maltreatment from poor health outcomes. Our findings emphasize that negative social determinants of health - such as a childhood history of maltreatment - confer risk for psychopathology and other physical health problems. If, however, a woman's current social circumstances are sufficiently positive, they can promote good health, particularly in the face of past adversity.",2017,11,1,"Psychological medicine","10.1017/S0033291717001027","PMC6293977","Psychol Med","eng","D000328; D054523; D001008; D003865; D004739; D005260; D006304; D006801; D007398; D008137; D011203; D065840; D012307; D012747; D012893; D012944; D019966; D014852","Adult; Adult Survivors of Child Abuse; Anxiety Disorders; Depressive Disorder, Major; England; Female; Health Status; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Longitudinal Studies; Poverty; Protective Factors; Risk Factors; Sexual Partners; Sleep Wake Disorders; Social Support; Substance-Related Disorders; Wales","G1002190; R01 HD077482","10.1111/jcpp.12621","<b>Declaration of interest:</b> None. <b>Conflict of interest:</b> None","MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre,Institute of Psychiatry,Psychology and Neuroscience,King's College London,London SE5 8AF,UK."

We evaluated whether the prevalence of ADHD varies by socioeconomic status (SES) and parental history of ADHD in a population-sample of elementary school children age 6-14&#xa0;years. We screened all children in grades 1-5 in 17 schools in one North Carolina (U.S.) county for ADHD using teacher rating scales and 1,160 parent interviews, including an ADHD structured interview (DISC). We combined parent and teacher ratings to determine DSM-IV ADHD status. Data analysis was restricted to 967 children with information about parental history of ADHD. SES was measured by family income and respondent education. We found an interaction between family income and parental history of ADHD diagnosis (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.016). The SES gradient was stronger in families without a parental history and weaker among children with a parental history. Among children without a parental history of ADHD diagnosis, low income children had 6.2 times the odds of ADHD (95% CI 3.4-11.3) as high income children after adjusting for covariates. Among children with a parental history, all had over 10 times the odds of ADHD as high income children without a parental history but the SES gradient between high and low income children was less pronounced [odds ratio (OR)&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.4, 95% CI 0.6-3.5]. Socioeconomic status and parental history of ADHD are each strong risk factors for ADHD that interact to determine prevalence. More research is needed to dissect the components of SES that contribute to risk of ADHD. Future ADHD research should evaluate whether the strength of other environmental risk factors vary by parental history. Early identification and interventions for children with low SES or parental histories of ADHD should be explored.",2018,3,1,"Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","10.1111/jcpp.12775","PMC5809323","J Child Psychol Psychiatry","eng","D000293; D001289; D002648; D016241; D005260; D006801; D008297; D009657; D015995; D012307; D012923","Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Child; Child of Impaired Parents; Female; Humans; Male; North Carolina; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Social Class","P20 GM109089; R01 MH071563; U54 GM104944; UL1 TR001449","NA","Conflict of interest statement: No conflicts declared.","Biostatistics and Computational Biology Branch, NIH, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Research Triangle Park, NC, USA."

Treatment options are scarce, and there is a need for effective and accessible treatments. Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (Internet-CBT) based on exposure exercises is effective for adult and adolescent irritable bowel syndrome, but it has not been evaluated for younger children. The objective of this study was to assess acceptability, feasibility, and potential clinical efficacy of Internet-CBT for children with P-FGIDs. This was a feasibility study with a within-group design. We included 31 children aged 8-12 years and diagnosed with P-FGID, according to the ROME III criteria. Mean duration of abdominal symptoms at baseline was 3.8 years (standard deviation [SD] 2.6). The treatment was therapist-guided and consisted of 10 weekly modules of exposure-based Internet-CBT. The children were instructed to provoke abdominal symptoms in a graded manner and to engage in previously avoided activities. The parents were taught to decrease their attention to their children's pain behaviors and to reinforce and support their work with the exposures. Assessments included treatment satisfaction, subjective treatment effect, gastrointestinal symptoms, quality of life, pain intensity, anxiety, depression, and school absence. Data were collected at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. Means, standard errors (SEs), and Cohen d effect sizes were estimated based on multi-level linear mixed models. Most children 25/31 (81%) completed 9 or 10 of the 10 treatment modules. Almost all children, 28/31 (90%), reported that the treatment had helped them to deal more effectively with their symptoms, and 27/31 (87%) children declared that their symptoms had improved during the treatment. Assessments from the parents were in accordance with the children's reports. No child or parent reported that the symptoms had worsened. We observed a large within-group effect size on the primary outcome measure, child-rated gastrointestinal symptoms from pretreatment to posttreatment (Cohen d=1.14, P&lt;.001, 95% CI 0.69-1.61), and this effect size was maintained at 6-month follow-up (Cohen d=1.40, P&lt;.001, 95% CI 1.04-1.81). We also observed significant improvements from pretreatment to posttreatment on a wide range of child- and parent-rated measures including quality of life, pain intensity, anxiety, depression, and school absence. All results remained stable or were further improved at 6-month follow-up. This study shows that children with longstanding P-FGIDs, and their parents, perceive exposure-based Internet-CBT as a helpful and feasible treatment. The included children improved significantly despite a long duration of abdominal symptoms before the intervention. The treatment shows potential to be highly effective for P-FGIDs. The results need to be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).",2017,8,10,"JMIR mental health","10.2196/mental.7985","PMC5571236","JMIR Ment Health","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1053/j.gastro.2005.08.063; 10.1371/journal.pone.0126982; 10.1016/j.jpeds.2008.09.047; 10.1136/jim-2016-000300; 10.1016/j.jpeds.2014.09.067; 10.1542/peds.2014-2123; 10.1016/j.cpr.2016.09.005; 10.1002/14651858.CD010971.pub2; 10.1016/j.cgh.2016.04.035; 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2004.02007.x; 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2010.01.003; 10.1016/j.janxdis.2013.04.006; 10.1371/journal.pone.0164647; 10.1016/j.brat.2011.04.001; 10.1016/j.brat.2010.03.003; 10.1016/j.brat.2014.01.007; 10.1038/ajg.2016.503; 10.1037/a0035216; 10.1016/j.pain.2005.12.020; 10.1038/ajg.2010.106; 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000800; 10.1080/17474124.2016.1207524; 10.1586/erp.12.67; 10.2196/jmir.1848; 10.1016/j.invent.2014.07.002; 10.1016/j.brat.2015.11.006; 10.1016/j.jaac.2016.09.515; 10.4088/JCP.09m05305whi; 10.1016/j.jbtep.2010.01.001; 10.1016/j.beth.2010.02.004; 10.1186/1471-2458-13-688; 10.1016/j.jpain.2008.04.007; 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2012.08.016; 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2010.01.025; 10.1016/j.pain.2007.08.038; 10.1542/peds.2013-0242; 10.1002/j.1532-2149.2013.00450.x; 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.00857.x; 10.1097/01.ajp.0000205257.80044.01; 10.1093/jpepsy/jsv095; 10.1016/j.jpain.2014.10.005; 10.1001/archinte.166.10.1092; 10.1016/j.pain.2010.05.011; 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000639; 10.1186/1471-230X-11-110; 10.1038/ajg.2011.139; 10.1001/2013.jamapediatrics.282; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2017.0091; 10.1007/s12529-012-9228-3; 10.1037/a0033439","Conflicts of Interest: None declared.","Department of Medicine, Solna, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."

Evidence indicates that perceived stress may comprise a barrier for smoking cessation, but little is known about the association of perceived stress and smoking in LMICs. We conducted a cross-sectional, community-based study comprising 217,561 people [mean age 38.5 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;16.1) years, 49.4% males]. A perceived stress score [range 2 (lowest-stress) 10 (highest-stress)] was computed from the Perceived Stress Scale. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted. In the overall sample, a one-unit increase in perceived-stress resulted in a 5% increased odds of smoking (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.05; 95%CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.03-1.06). Increased stress was associated with smoking in Africa (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.06; 95%CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.04-1.09), Americas (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.03; 95%CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.01-1.05), and Asia (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.06; 95%CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.04-1.08), but not Europe (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.99; 95%CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.95-1.02).

Nonetheless, there is limited research examining these relationships during late childhood, and particularly in the critical period of brain development occurring between 8 and 10&#xa0;years of age. The effects of the family environment on the brain during late childhood may have significant implications for later functioning, and particularly mental health. The Families and Childhood Transitions Study (FACTS) is a multidisciplinary longitudinal cohort study of brain development and mental health, with two waves of data collection currently funded, occurring 18-months apart, when child participants are aged approximately 8- and 10-years old. Participants are 163 children (M age [SD]&#xa0;=&#xa0;8.44 [0.34] years, 76 males) and their mothers (M age [SD]&#xa0;=&#xa0;40.34 [5.43] years). Of the 163 families who consented to participate, 156 completed a video-recorded and observer-coded dyadic interaction task and 153 completed a child magnetic resonance imaging brain scan at baseline. Families were recruited from lower socioeconomic status (SES) areas to maximise rates of social disadvantage and variation in parenting behaviours. All experimental measures and tasks completed at baseline are repeated at an 18-month follow-up, excluding the observer coded family interaction tasks. The baseline assessment was completed in October 2015, and the 18-month follow up will be completed May 2017. This study, by examining the neurobiological and mental health consequences of variations in parenting, has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of child development and risk processes. Recruitment of lower SES families will also allow assessment of resilience factors given the poorer outcomes often associated with this population.",2017,6,30,"BMC pediatrics","10.1186/s12887-017-0905-x","PMC5493854","BMC Pediatr","eng","D001921; D002648; D002657; D002985; D005260; D006801; D008137; D008279; D008297; D001523; D010287; D016487; D012307","Brain; Child; Child Development; Clinical Protocols; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mental Disorders; Parent-Child Relations; Parenting; Risk Factors",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0147774; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.01.005; 10.1177/2167702613505531; 10.1016/j.dcn.2013.10.006; 10.1017/S0954579410000684; 10.1017/S0954579410000787; 10.1093/scan/nsp012; 10.1073/pnas.0709815105; 10.1001/archpsyc.65.12.1377; 10.1017/S1355617710000585; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.07.003; 10.1073/pnas.1118003109; 10.1016/S0149-7634(00)00014-2; 10.1037/0893-3200.19.2.305; 10.1037/0003-066X.53.2.185; 10.1177/0743554897121003; 10.2307/2137333; 10.1207/s15374424jccp2402_7; 10.1037/0893-3200.22.1.123; 10.1023/A:1005295328151; 10.1023/A:1009524626436; 10.1037/0021-843X.116.1.144; 10.1176/ajp.2006.163.6.993; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01196.x; 10.1007/s10802-011-9542-2; 10.1016/j.brat.2011.02.008; 10.1023/A:1025768504415; 10.1038/nature02725; 10.1016/S0885-2014(02)00121-1; 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9861(19971020)387:2&lt;167::AID-CNE1&gt;3.0.CO;2-Z; 10.1016/S0736-5748(98)00025-2; 10.1016/0306-4530(93)90026-H; 10.1210/endo.136.8.7628364; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02271.x; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.05.074; 10.1001/archpediatrics.2011.565; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.08.007; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02281.x; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13070920; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.3139; 10.1073/pnas.1601443113; 10.1016/j.jaac.2015.07.009; 10.1371/journal.pone.0154220; 10.1002/ab.20016; 10.1097/00004583-199612000-00020; 10.1037/0893-3200.16.2.209; 10.1207/s15327922par0601_4; 10.1007/s00787-014-0619-7; 10.1111/1467-8624.00405; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2003.09.013; 10.1002/dev.21275; 10.1371/journal.pone.0004887; 10.1901/jaba.1979.12-691; 10.1037/0012-1649.27.6.1000; 10.1037/0022-006X.71.4.782; 10.1097/00001756-200001170-00009; 10.1016/j.physbeh.2007.05.004; 10.1016/j.bbi.2013.08.010; 10.1186/1471-2431-14-115; 10.1186/1471-2288-11-170; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.10.004; 10.1016/j.forsciint.2011.02.015; 10.25011/cim.v30i5.2894; 10.1016/j.ygcen.2006.01.005; 10.1097/00004583-199707000-00021; 10.1111/cdev.12017; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.02.076; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.02.084; 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.032408.153550; 10.3758/BF03206553; 10.1038/13158; 10.1093/cercor/bhr018; 10.2307/1130197; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.05.007; 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2006.06.010; 10.1017/S095457940100311X; 10.1038/nrn2639; 10.1016/S0018-506X(02)00008-9; 10.1016/S0140-6736(94)92587-9; 10.1002/ajhb.21111; 10.1017/S0954579411000587; 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2006.12.007; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.02.011; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.06.028; 10.1016/j.cpr.2016.10.003; 10.1016/S0191-8869(00)00074-X; 10.1023/A:1021326822957; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1998.tb06161.x; 10.1016/0028-3932(71)90067-4; 10.1111/1467-9507.00073; 10.1016/j.paid.2014.09.040; 10.1037/0012-1649.32.3.457; 10.1207/s15374424jccp2503_8; 10.1037/0022-3514.70.6.1327; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2007.02114.x; 10.1037/0022-006X.56.6.893; 10.1891/vivi.2005.20.5.529; 10.1542/pir.21-8-265; 10.1007/BF00911316; 10.1037/1040-3590.12.2.174; 10.1177/014662167700100306; 10.1111/j.1467-842X.2000.tb00145.x; 10.2307/1129734; 10.1177/104973159900900105; 10.1007/BF01537962; 10.1007/BF02088471","ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Ethics approval was granted by the University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Office (#1339904).

"28666425","A process evaluation exploring the lay counsellor experience of delivering a task shared psycho-social intervention for perinatal depression in Khayelitsha, South Africa.","Memory Munodawafa, Crick Lund, Marguerite Schneider","Task sharing of psycho-social interventions for perinatal depression has been shown to be feasible, acceptable and effective in low and middle-income countries. This study conducted a process evaluation exploring the perceptions of counsellors who delivered a task shared psycho-social counselling intervention for perinatal depression in Khayelitsha, Cape Town together with independent fidelity ratings. Post intervention qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with six counsellors from the AFrica Focus on Intervention Research for Mental health (AFFIRM-SA) randomised controlled trial on their perceptions of delivering a task shared psycho-social intervention for perinatal depression. Themes were identified using the framework approach and were coded and analysed using Nvivo v11. These interviews were supplemented with fidelity ratings for each counsellor and supervision notes. Facilitating factors in the delivery of the intervention included intervention related factors such as: the content of the intervention, ongoing training and supervision, using a counselling manual, conducting counselling sessions in the local language (isiXhosa) and fidelity to the manual; counsellor factors included counsellors' confidence and motivation to conduct the sessions; participant factors included older age, commitment and a desire to be helped. Barriers included contextual factors such as poverty, crime and lack of space to conduct counselling sessions and participant factors such as the nature of the participant's problem, young age, and avoidance of contact with counsellors. Fidelity ratings and dropout rates varied substantially between counsellors. These findings show that a variety of intervention, counsellor, participant and contextual factors need to be considered in the delivery of task sharing counselling interventions. Careful attention needs to be paid to ongoing supervision and quality of care if lay counsellors are to deliver good quality task shared counselling interventions in under-resourced communities.

Initial stages of these disorders are essential in understanding the increased vulnerability of developing cardiometabolic disturbances, associated with a reduced life expectancy. This study aimed to evaluate the metabolic profile of a cohort of patients with a FEP and its evolution during a two year follow-up, as well as the factors that influence the changes in their metabolic status. 16 participating centers from the PEPs Project recruited 335 subjects with a FEP and 253 matched healthy controls, aged 9-35years. We investigated a set of anthropometric measures, vital signs and laboratory data obtained from each participant over two years in a prospective, naturalistic study. From the beginning of the study the FEP group showed differences in the metabolic profile compared to the control group, together with a progressive worsening in the major part of the analyzed variables during the follow-up period, with higher rates of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Certain risk factors were related to determinate clinical variables such as male gender, the presence of affective symptoms or an early onset or to treatment variables such as the use of antipsychotic polypharmacy, antidepressants or mood stabilizers.

An RCT using a three-cohort multiple baseline design was conducted in 2010-2014. Participants were United Methodist clergy in North Carolina, U.S., in 2010, invited based on occupational status. Of invited 1,745 clergy, 1,114 consented, provided baseline data, and were randomly assigned to immediate intervention (n=395), 1-year waitlist (n=283), or 2-year waitlist (n=436) cohorts for a 48-month trial duration. The 2-year intervention consisted of personal goal setting and encouragement to engage in monthly health coaching, an online weight loss intervention, a small grant, and three workshops delivering stress management and theological content supporting healthy behaviors. Participants were not blinded to intervention. Trial outcomes were metabolic syndrome (primary) and self-reported stress and depressive symptoms (secondary). Intervention effects were estimated in 2016 in an intention-to-treat framework using generalized estimating equations with adjustment for baseline level of the outcome and follow-up time points. Log-link Poisson generalized estimating equations with robust SEs was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) for binary outcomes; mean differences were used for continuous/score outcomes. Baseline prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 50.9% and depression was 11.4%. The 12-month intervention effect showed a benefit for metabolic syndrome (PR=0.86, 95% CI=0.79, 0.94, p&lt;0.001). This benefit was sustained at 24 months of intervention (PR=0.88; 95% CI=0.78, 1.00, p=0.04). There was no significant effect on depression or stress scores. The Spirited Life intervention improved metabolic syndrome prevalence in a population of U.S. Christian clergy and sustained improvements during 24 months of intervention. These findings offer support for long-duration behavior change interventions and population-level interventions that allow participants to set their own health goals.

"28639082","Socio-economic factors associated with the 1&#x2011;year prevalence of severe pain and pain-related sickness absence in the Austrian population.","Ellenor Mittendorfer-Rutz, Thomas Ernst Dorner","The aim of this study was to (1)&#xa0;investigate the relation of socio-economic status (SES), measured as education, occupation, and income, with the 12-month prevalence of severe pain and with pain-related sickness absence, and (2)&#xa0;analyse to what extent sociodemographic and medical factors influence these associations. The study population comprised 8084 subjects aged between 15 and 65&#xa0;years from the Austrian Health Interview Survey in 2006/07. Associations of SES with the 1&#x2011;year prevalence of severe pain and sickness absence due to pain in those with severe pain was assessed with logistic regression analysis and adjusted for socio-demographic and chronic medical conditions. The 1&#x2011;year prevalence of severe pain was 33.7%. Among those with severe pain, 32.9% were on sickness absence due to pain. SES was significantly associated with the prevalence of severe pain and even more strongly with sickness absence due to pain. Stepwise adjustment for socio-demographics and medical factors had only marginal effects on these associations.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of sodium oxybate in clinical practice in patients with narcolepsy and cataplexy refractory to other treatments. This was a retrospective single centre study including patients with severe narcolepsy with cataplexy refractory to other treatments, who were initiated on sodium oxybate between 2009 and 2015. Patients were allowed to be on other stimulants or/and anti-cataplectic agents. Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) and weekly cataplexy events were recorded. Side effects (SEs) were recorded at every follow-up visit. 90 patients were prescribed sodium oxybate, with a total of 3116 patient-months of drug exposure. ESS and weekly cataplexy events were significantly reduced by sodium oxybate for all patients (&#x394;ESS&#xa0;=&#xa0;4.3&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;4.4 and &#x394;cataplexy&#xa0;=&#xa0;21.8&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;18.5 events/week; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.0001, respectively). The required maintenance dose could not be predicted based upon gender, body mass index, or clinical factors. 60% of patients were able to reduce or come off other medications. Half of the patients experienced at least one SE, and 26.6% had to stop treatment due to limiting SEs. Nausea, mood swings and enuresis were the most commonly reported SEs. SEs that led to drug discontinuation, particularly psychosis, were associated with increasing age and were observed early after the initiation of the drug. Sodium oxybate provides a good clinical efficacy and acceptable safety profile in routine clinical practice for the treatment of patients suffering from narcolepsy with cataplexy.

Understanding longitudinal alterations to white matter may provide new insights into trajectories of brain change in both healthy aging and AD, and fluid biomarkers may be particularly useful in this effort. To examine this, 151 late-middle-aged participants enriched with risk for AD with at least one lumbar puncture and two diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans were selected for analysis from two large observational and longitudinally followed cohorts. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was assayed for biomarkers of AD-specific pathology (phosphorylated-tau/A&#x3b2;42 ratio), axonal degeneration (neurofilament light chain protein, NFL), dendritic degeneration (neurogranin), and inflammation (chitinase-3-like protein 1, YKL-40). Linear mixed effects models were performed to test the hypothesis that biomarkers for AD, neurodegeneration, and inflammation, or two-year change in those biomarkers, would be associated with worse white matter health overall and/or progressively worsening white matter health over time. At baseline in the cingulum, phosphorylated-tau/A&#x3b2;42 was associated with higher mean diffusivity (MD) overall (intercept) and YKL-40 was associated with increases in MD over time. Two-year change in neurogranin was associated with higher mean diffusivity and lower fractional anisotropy overall (intercepts) across white matter in the entire brain and in the cingulum. These findings suggest that biomarkers for AD, neurodegeneration, and inflammation are potentially important indicators of declining white matter health in a cognitively healthy, late-middle-aged cohort.",2019,2,1,"Brain imaging and behavior","10.1007/s11682-017-9732-9","PMC5723250","Brain Imaging Behav","eng","D000328; D000368; D000544; D053327; D015415; D056324; D018450; D005260; D006801; D008137; D008297; D008875; D009410; D066127","Adult; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoprotein E4; Biomarkers; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Nerve Degeneration; White Matter","U54 HD090256; DGE-1256259; T32GM008692; U54-HD090256; U54 AI117924; UL1 TR000427; UL1 RR025011; F30 AG054115; UL1RR025011; R01-EB022883; P50 AG033514; U54-AI117924; R56-AG052698; R01 EB022883; AG000213; T32 GM007507; T32 AG000213; SES-0849122; T32 GM008692; T32GM007507; AG021155; R01 AG021155; R56 AG037639; AG027161; R01 AG037639; RF1 AG027161; UF1 AG051216; UF1-AG051216; R01 AG027161; R56 AG052698; AG037639","10.1002/mrm.25226; 10.1002/iub.357; 10.1016/s1474-4422(12)70291-0; 10.1001/jamaneurol.2015.1867; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.050; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.02.028; 10.1038/nrg2825; 10.3233/JAD-150897; 10.3390/ijms15034671; 10.3233/JAD-2012-120787; 10.1073/pnas.210184697; 10.1093/brain/awv267; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.10.030; 10.3233/BEN-2009-0234; 10.1001/jamaneurol.2015.1285; 10.1001/jamaneurol.2016.0086; 10.1001/jamaneurol.2015.3037","<b>Conflict of Interest</b>.

Evidence suggests a relationship between economic variables and suicidal behaviour. To plan effective suicide prevention interventions in LMICs we need to understand the relationship between poverty and suicidal behaviour and how contextual factors may mediate this relationship. We conducted a systematic mapping of the English literature on poverty and suicidal behaviour in LMICs, to provide an overview of what is known about this topic, highlight gaps in literature, and consider the implications of current knowledge for research and policy. Eleven databases were searched using a combination of key words for suicidal ideation and behaviours, poverty and LMICs to identify articles published in English between January 2004 and April 2014. Narrative analysis was performed for the 84 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Most English studies in this area come from South Asia and Middle, East and North Africa, with a relative dearth of studies from countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Most of the available evidence comes from upper middle-income countries; only 6% of studies come from low-income countries. Most studies focused on poverty measures such as unemployment and economic status, while neglecting dimensions such as debt, relative and absolute poverty, and support from welfare systems. Most studies are conducted within a risk-factor paradigm and employ descriptive statistics thus providing little insight into the nature of the relationship.

A sizeable interdisciplinary literature was organized through a bifurcated developmental trajectory (BiDeT) framework, an account of the external and internal variables associated with low SES that may lead to difficulties with attention and learning, along with buffers that may protect against negative outcomes. A consistent neurocognitive finding is that low-SES children attend to information nonselectively, and engage in late filtering out of task-irrelevant information. Attentional preferences influence the development of latent inhibition (LI), an aspect of learning that involves reassigning meaningful associations to previously learned but irrelevant stimuli. LI reflects learning processes clarifying the relationship between neurobiological mechanisms related to attention and socioeconomic disadvantage during child development. Notably, changes in both selective attention and typical LI development may occur via the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (MsCL-DA) system. Chaotic environments, social isolation, and deprivation associated with low SES trigger stress responses implicating imbalances in the MsCL-DA and consolidating anxiety traits. BiDeT describes plausible interactions between socioemotional traits and low-SES environments that modify selective attention and LI, predisposing individuals to vulnerability in cognitive development and academic achievement.

However, there is little evidence from LMICs to guide this process. The aim of this study was to explore barriers to, and facilitators of, service user/caregiver involvement in rural Ethiopia to inform the development of a scalable approach. Thirty nine semi-structured interviews were carried out with purposively selected mental health service users (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;13), caregivers (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;10), heads of primary care facilities (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;8) and policy makers/planners/service developers (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;8). The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed in Amharic, and translated into English. Thematic analysis was applied. All groups of participants supported service user and caregiver involvement in mental health system strengthening. Potential benefits were identified as (i) improved appropriateness and quality of services, and (ii) greater protection against mistreatment and promotion of respect for service users. However, hardly any respondents had prior experience of service user involvement. Stigma was considered to be a pervasive barrier, operating within the health system, the local community and individuals. Competing priorities of service users included the need to obtain adequate individual care and to work for survival. Low recognition of the potential contribution of service users seemed linked to limited empowerment and mobilization of service users. Potential health system facilitators included a culture of community oversight of primary care services. All groups of respondents identified a need for awareness-raising and training to equip service users, caregivers, service providers and local community for involvement. Empowerment at the level of individual service users (information about mental health conditions, care and rights) and the group level (for advocacy and representation) were considered essential, alongside improved, accessible mental health care and livelihood interventions.

SES disparities have been linked to variance in brain structures particularly the hippocampus, a neural substrate of learning and memory. However, it is unclear whether the association between SES and hippocampal volume is similar in children and adults. We investigated the relationship between hippocampal volume and SES in a group of children (n = 31, age 8-12&#xa0;years) and a group of young adults (n = 32, age 18-25&#xa0;years). SES was assessed with four indicators that loaded on a single factor, therefore a composite SES scores was used in the main analyses. Hippocampal volume was measured using manual demarcation on high resolution structural images. SES was associated with hippocampal volume in the children, but not in adults, suggesting that in childhood, but not adulthood, SES-related environmental factors influence hippocampal volume. In addition, hippocampal volume, but not SES, was associated with scores on a memory task, suggesting that net effects of postnatal environmental factors, captured by SES, are more distal determinants of memory performance than hippocampal volume. Longitudinal investigation of the association between SES, hippocampal volume and cognitive functioning may further our understanding of the putative neural mechanisms underlying SES-related environmental effects on cognitive development.",2018,5,1,"Developmental science","10.1111/desc.12561","PMC5668203","Dev Sci","eng","D000293; D000328; D001076; D002648; D003071; D005260; D006624; D006801; D008297; D008568; D009929; D012923; D013315; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Aptitude; Child; Cognition; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Male; Memory; Organ Size; Social Class; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult","R01 MH107512","NA",NA,"The Institute of Gerontology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, 48202, USA."

Significant sex disparities have been identified for affective pathology, with females having an increased risk of developing anxiety and depressive disorder. However, the effects of early life stress (ELS) on cognitive development have not been as well characterized, especially in reference to sex specific impacts of ELS on cognitive abilities over development. In mice, fragmented maternal care resulting from maternal bedding restriction, was used to induce ELS. The development of spatial abilities were tracked using a novel object placement (NOP) task at several different ages across early development (P21, P28, P38, P50, and P75). Male mice exposed to ELS showed significant impairments in the NOP task compared with control reared mice at all ages tested. In female mice, ELS led to impaired NOP performance immediately following weaning (P21) and during peri-adolescence (P38), but these effects did not persist into early adulthood. Prior work has implicated impaired hippocampus neurogenesis as a possible mediator of negative outcomes in ELS males. In the hippocampus of behaviorally na&#xef;ve animals there was a significant decrease in expression of Ki-67 (proliferative marker) and doublecortin (DCX-immature cell marker) as mice aged, and a more rapid developmental decline in these markers in ELS reared mice. However, the effect of ELS dissipated by P28 and no main effect of sex were observed. Together these results indicate that ELS impacts the development of spatial abilities in both male and female mice and that these effects are more profound and lasting in males.",2017,12,1,"Neurobiology of stress","10.1016/j.ynstr.2017.04.001","PMC5408156","Neurobiol Stress","eng",NA,NA,"P20 GM103430; T32 NS062443","NA",NA,"Department of Neuroscience, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, United States."

However, few studies have taken an intersectional approach to investigate inequalities in mental health using latent class analysis (LCA). This study will examine the association between multiple indicator classes of social identity with common mental disorder (CMD). Data on CMD symptoms were assessed in a diverse inner London sample of 1052 participants in the second wave of the South East London Community Health study. LCA was used to define classes of social identity using multiple indicators of SES, ethnicity and migration status. Adjusted associations between CMD and both individual indicators and multiple indicators of social identity are presented. LCA identified six groups that were differentiated by varying levels of privilege and disadvantage based on multiple SES indicators. This intersectional approach highlighted nuanced differences in odds of CMD, with the economically inactive group with multiple levels of disadvantage most likely to have a CMD. Adding ethnicity and migration status further differentiated between groups. The migrant, economically inactive and White British, economically inactive classes both had increased odds of CMD. This is the first study to examine the intersections of SES, ethnicity and migration status with CMD using LCA. Results showed that both the migrant, economically inactive and the White British, economically inactive classes had a similarly high prevalence of CMD.

However, findings have been mixed as to whether CT explains links between SES and cognitive performance. In the current study, we hypothesized that this inconsistency may have arisen from the fact that socioeconomic factors (family income and parental education) may moderate the relation between CT and neurocognitive skills. Results indicated that associations between CT and cognitive performance did vary by SES for both language and executive function (EF) abilities. Across all ages, there was a negative correlation between CT and cognitive skills, with thinner cortices associated with higher language and EF scores. Similarly, across all cognitive skills, children from higher-SES homes outperformed their age-matched peers from lower-SES homes. Moderation analyses indicated that the impact of SES was not constant across CT, with SES more strongly predictive of EF skills among children with thicker cortices and more strongly predictive of language skills among children with thinner cortices. This suggests that socioeconomic advantage may in some cases buffer against a neurobiological risk factor for poor performance.

Using a large (N = 34,653), nationally representative US adult sample, the 2004-2005 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, we examined whether individuals who first attempted suicide during childhood (under the age of 13 years) differ from those who first attempted suicide during adolescence (13 through 17 years) in (1) contributing factors for first suicide attempt, including mental disorders and traumatic experiences that occurred before the first suicide attempt, parental history of mental disorders, and family poverty and (2) adulthood mental health outcomes, including lifetime and current prevalence of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders and quality of life measures. Suicide attempts during childhood (n = 104) were more strongly related to childhood maltreatment, while suicide attempts during adolescence (n = 415) were more strongly associated with major depressive episode. Compared to first suicide attempts during adolescence, first attempts during childhood were associated with increased risk for multiple suicide attempts (61.3% vs 32.6%), several psychiatric disorders (mania, hypomania, and panic disorder), and poorer social functioning during adulthood (all P values &lt; .05).

The measured reactivity depends on the quantity of sweat secreted by those eccrine sweat glands that are located in the hypodermis of palmar and plantar regions. Electrodermal hyporeactive individuals are those who show an unusual rapid habituation to identical non-significant stimuli. Previous findings suggested that electrodermal hyporeactivity has a high sensitivity and a high specificity for suicide. The aims of the present study are to test the effectiveness and the usefulness of the EDOR (ElectroDermal Orienting Reactivity) Test as a support in the suicide risk assessment of depressed patients and to assess the predictive value of electrodermal hyporeactivity, measured through the EDOR Test, for suicide and suicide attempt in adult patients with a primary diagnosis of depression. 1573 patients with a primary diagnosis of depression, whether currently depressed or in remission, have been recruited at 15 centres in 9 different European countries. Depressive symptomatology was evaluated through the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale. Previous suicide attempts were registered and the suicide intent of the worst attempt was rated according to the first eight items of the Beck Suicide Intent Scale. The suicide risk was also assessed according to rules and traditions at the centre. The EDOR Test was finally performed. During the EDOR Test, two fingers are put on gold electrodes and direct current of 0.5 V is passed through the epidermis of the fingers according to standards. A moderately strong tone is presented through headphones now and then during the test. The electrodermal responses to the stimuli represent an increase in the conductance due to the increased number of filled sweat ducts that act as conductors through the electrically highly resistant epidermis. Each patient is followed up for one year in order to assess the occurrence of intentional self-harm. Based on previous studies, expected results would be that patients realizing a suicide attempt with a strong intent or committing suicide should be electrodermally hyporeactive in most cases and non-hyporeactive patients should show only few indications of death intent or suicides.

We investigated the prevalence of delirium occurring within one week of stroke in Nigerian survivors and its association with dementia and mortality at 3months. Delirium was ascertained after repeated assessments within one week of stroke using the Confusion Assessment Method. Demographic and clinical characteristics, stroke severity, current and pre-morbid cognitive functioning were also assessed. Participants were then followed up for 3months using culturally-validated neuropsychological tools. Probable dementia was ascertained according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS-AIREN) criteria. Associations were investigated using both binomial and multinomial logistic regression analyses and presented as odds ratios (O.R) and relative risk ratios (RRR). Of 101 consenting stroke survivors, 99 had two assessments for delirium within one week of the stroke. Delirium was present in 33.3% of stroke survivors (65.6% hypoactive, 21.9% hyperactive, and 12.1% mixed type). Having a severe stroke was associated with delirium (O.R=6.2, 95% C.I=1.1-13.8) after adjusting for age, gender, education and economic status, lifestyle factors, multimorbidities and laterality. At follow-up, those with severe stroke had a stronger association between delirium and dementia (RRR=4.3, 95% C.I=1.2-15.6) or death (RRR=3.7, 95% C.I=1.1-12.1).

Patient's responses to their experiences of using services are under-researched in the context of mental healthcare in low income countries. Our aim was to use mixed methods to develop a new measure of satisfaction for use among consumers of the new models of mental healthcare which are currently being scaled-up. We used qualitative methods to explore the concept of service satisfaction. On the basis of these findings, we developed a new 'Mental health service satisfaction scale' (MHSSS v0.0) by adapting existing measures of service satisfaction. We evaluated psychometric properties of the new measure, among a sample of service users with severe mental disorder (SMD) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;200) and caregivers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;200). Following expert review, a modified version of the measure was developed (MHSSS v1.0) and psychometric properties were examined with data from a second independent sample (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;150 service users with SMD and n&#x2009;=&#x2009;150 caregivers). Factors identified in analysis of the first quantitative sample coincide with core concepts of service satisfaction as reported in the literature and were reflected in the key themes which emerged from our qualitative study: interpersonal factors, efficacy, communication, technical competency and adequacy of facilities. There was generally consensus among caregivers and service users regarding dimensions of satisfaction. However there was evidence of some differences in prioritization. Revisions made to version 0.0 of the Mental Health Service Satisfaction Scale (MHSSS) led to an improved instrument, with excellent internal consistency, convergent validity and factor loadings indicative of a uni-dimensional construct. Our findings suggest that conceptions of service satisfaction among people accessing a service for SMD are broadly similar with those established in the literature. Our findings indicate that the MHSSS might be a useful candidate for inclusion in the new toolkit of measures needed to facilitate monitoring of service satisfaction which will be crucial to quality improvement.",2017,3,9,"BMC health services research","10.1186/s12913-017-2126-2","PMC5343366","BMC Health Serv Res","eng","D017028; D003142; D003156; D003219; D005002; D005260; D006801; D008297; D001523; D008875; D010353; D017060; D010549; D011203; D011369; D011594; D019035","Caregivers; Communication; Community Mental Health Services; Confidentiality; Ethiopia; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Patient Education as Topic; Patient Satisfaction; Personal Satisfaction; Poverty; Professional-Patient Relations; Psychometrics; Rural Health Services","U19 MH095699","10.1001/jama.1988.03410120089033; 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2013.12.010; 10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00210-0; 10.1097/00005650-198407000-00011; 10.4102/curationis.v20i2.1302; 10.1016/0149-7189(83)90005-8; 10.1093/oxfordjournals.schbul.a007000; 10.1016/j.psychres.2014.01.045; 10.1097/00005650-198601000-00007; 10.1371/journal.pone.0100153; 10.1186/1756-0500-7-657; 10.3109/09540261.2010.545990; 10.1017/S2045796015000281; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001359; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61238-0; 10.1186/1472-6963-14-113; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.07.057; 10.2471/BLT.16.170605; 10.1093/heapol/17.1.42; 10.1093/intqhc/10.2.93; 10.1093/intqhc/mzr019; 10.1017/S0033291700028609; 10.1007/s00127-003-0606-7; 10.1186/s13063-016-1191-x; 10.7748/nr2011.01.18.2.52.c8284; 10.1097/00005053-199309000-00004; 10.1177/001316446002000104; 10.2307/2529310; 10.1093/heapol/czv072; 10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00235-5; 10.1111/j.1440-0979.2005.00363.x; 10.1046/j.1440-0979.2003.00276.x; 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.083733; 10.1007/s00127-006-0123-6; 10.1007/s10597-013-9667-6; 10.1080/00048670802653349; 10.1377/hlthaff.15.4.42",NA,"King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Centre for Global Mental Health, London, UK."

We used annual income data between the ages of 3-14&#x2005;years and identified 5 trajectories (2 high-income upward, 1 downward and 2 low-income upward trajectories). Psychiatric disorders in the follow-up period after age 15 were defined from International Classification of Disease (ICD)-codes in a nationwide patient register. Multiadjusted risks for all psychiatric disorders, as well as for specific psychiatric diagnoses, were calculated as HRs with 95% CIs. Of the 5 identified income trajectories, the constant low and the downward trajectories were particularly associated with later psychiatric disorder. Children with these trajectories had increased risks for psychiatric disorder, including mood, anxiety, psychotic disorders and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The association remained, even after adjusting for important variables including parental psychiatric disorder. In contrast, the relationship was reversed for eating disorders, for which children in higher income trajectories had elevated risks. Findings show that children growing up in a household characterised by low or decreasing family income have an increased risk for psychiatric disorder.

We use primary data from a survey of 330 informal primary caregivers who completed both a RUD-Lite and a socio-demographic questionnaire to evaluate the severity of dementia and caregiver's burden. The costs of dementia are broken into three components: direct medical costs (medical care, drugs, tests); direct social costs (social service, daycare); and indirect costs (mostly associated to informal care). The average monthly cost per patient is estimated at US$ 1,463. Direct medical costs account for 20 per cent, direct social costs for 5 per cent and indirect costs for 75 per cent of the total cost. The mean monthly cost is found to be inversely related to SES, a pattern largely driven by indirect costs. The monthly cost for high SES is US$ 1,083 and US$ 1,588 for low SES. A multivariate regression analysis suggests that severity of dementia and caregiver's burden account for between 49 and 70 per cent of the difference in the indirect cost across SES. However, between one-third and one-half of the variation across SES is not due to gradient in severity of dementia. Direct medical costs increase in higher SES, reflecting differences in purchasing power, while indirect costs are inversely related to SES and more than compensate differences in medical costs. Moreover, in lower SES groups, female caregivers, typically family members who are inactive in the labor market, mostly provide informal care. The average annual cost of dementia in Chile (US$ 17,559) is lower in comparison to high-income countries (US$ 39,595) and the proportion of cost related to informal cost is higher (74 per cent compared to 40 per cent). SES is a key determinant in the cost of dementia. In the absence of universal access to treatment, part of the social cost of dementia potentially preserves or increases income and gender inequality.",2017,1,1,"PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0172204","PMC5340351","PLoS One","eng","D000328; D000368; D000369; D017028; D002677; D017281; D003365; D003430; D003704; D005260; D017048; D006801; D008297; D008875; D012923; D012959; D055815","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Caregivers; Chile; Cost of Illness; Costs and Cost Analysis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dementia; Female; Health Care Costs; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult",NA,"10.1016/S1474-4422(09)70298-4; 10.1056/NEJMp1514202; 10.3233/JAD-122086; 10.1159/000338606; 10.1176/jnp.12.2.233; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.06.046; 10.1007/s10198-003-0189-y; 10.1056/NEJMsa1204629; 10.3233/JAD-2010-1258; 10.1016/j.archger.2015.01.020; 10.1017/S104161021500040X; 10.1002/gps.1729; 10.1016/j.jalz.2010.01.010; 10.1080/13607863.2011.596805; 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60153-2; 10.1212/WNL.0000000000001096; 10.1093/heapol/czt054; 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61646-9; 10.1016/S1474-4422(15)00307-5; 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)71146-6; 10.1056/NEJMsa0707519; 10.1016/j.gaceta.2012.11.005; 10.1136/jnnp.2005.072306; 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61647-0","<b>Competing Interests: </b>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Physiopathology Department, ICBM and East Neuroscience Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile."

"28220086","Students Wearing Police Uniforms Exhibit Biased Attention toward Individuals Wearing Hoodies.","Ciro Civile, Sukhvinder S Obhi","Police provide an essential public service and they often operate in difficult circumstances, requiring high-speed cognition. Recent incidents involving apparent profiling and aggressive behavior have led to accusations that the police are sometimes biased. Given that previous research has shown a link between clothing and cognition, we investigated the question of whether the police uniform itself might induce a bias in social attention. To address this question, and using a Canadian university student sample, we assessed whether wearing a police uniform biases attention toward black faces compared to white faces, and low-status individuals compared to high-status individuals. In Experiment 1 (<i>n</i> = 28), participants wore either a police-style uniform or mechanic overalls, and performed a shape categorization task in the presence of a distractor that could be either: a black face, a white face, a person wearing a hoodie (whom we propose will be associated with low SES), or a person wearing a suit (whom we propose will be associated with high SES). Participants wearing the police-style uniform exhibited biased attention, indexed by slower reaction times (RTs), in the presence of low-SES images. In Experiment 2 (<i>n</i> = 28), we confirmed this bias using a modified Dot-Probe task - an alternate measure of attentional bias in which we observed faster RTs to a dot probe that was spatially aligned with a low SES image. Experiment 3 (<i>n</i> = 56) demonstrated that attentional bias toward low-SES targets appears only when participants <i>wear</i> the police-style uniform, and not when they are simply exposed to it - by having it placed on the desk in front of them. Our results demonstrate that wearing a police-style uniform biases attention toward low-SES targets. Thus, wearing a police-style uniform may induce a kind of ""status-profiling"" in which individuals from low-status groups become salient and capture attention. We note that our results are limited to university students and that it will be important to extend them to members of the community and law-enforcement officers. We discuss how uniforms might exert their effects on cognition by virtue of the power and cultural associations they evoke in the wearer.",2017,1,1,"Frontiers in psychology","10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00062","PMC5292616","Front Psychol","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.7717/peerj.1210; 10.1037/a0033872; 10.1177/0093854883010001002; 10.1080/02690055.2013.826885; 10.1111/j.1559-1816.1974.tb02599.x; 10.1177/0361684315604820; 10.1177/2158244016646150; 10.1108/13639510310460314; 10.1177/1077727X7500400103; 10.1038/nrn755; 10.1037/0022-3514.83.6.1314; 10.1177/1745691611406920; 10.1080/08838151.2011.651187; 10.1037/0022-3514.87.6.876; 10.2147/JPR.S67431; 10.3758/BF03193146; 10.1177/0887302X9201100103; 10.1037/0003-066X.48.6.621; 10.1080/026999300378996; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01824.x; 10.1016/j.trf.2013.09.005; 10.2307/1169991; 10.1016/S0022-1031(03)00020-9; 10.2307/1165127; 10.1111/j.1745-9125.1998.tb01251.x; 10.1037/a0033477; 10.1037/xge0000023; 10.1080/00909889109365301; 10.1080/17470210802271650; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2007.08.002; 10.1177/147470491201000113; 10.1080/14640748808402292; 10.1037/0021-843X.95.1.15; 10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2006.05.006; 10.1111/j.1755-618X.2005.tb00841.x; 10.1111/j.1559-1816.1984.tb02219.x; 10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2005.06.002; 10.1086/680326; 10.1016/S0047-2352(03)00002-3; 10.1037/0022-3514.81.2.181; 10.1111/j.0956-7976.2005.00800.x; 10.1037/0022-3514.61.3.380; 10.5465/AMR.1993.3997506; 10.1037/0022-3514.39.4.590; 10.1177/0146167203029005008; 10.1068/p281059; 10.1080/00223980.1985.10542882; 10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00312.x; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01992.x; 10.1037/0033-2909.120.1.3",NA,"Social Brain, Body and Action Lab, Department of Psychology, Neuroscience and Behavior, McMaster University Hamilton, ON, Canada."

Secondary analyses of the National Survey of Children's Health for years 2003, 2007, and 2011-2012 were conducted to identify trends in parent reported lifetime prevalence and comorbidity among children with asthma, ADHD, and ASD and examine variation by sociodemographic characteristics, poverty status, and insurance coverage. Using 2011-2012 data, multivariable regression was used to examine whether poverty status predicted higher than average comorbid conditions after adjusting for other sociodemographic characteristics. Parent-reported lifetime prevalence of asthma and ADHD rose 18% and 44%, respectively, whereas the lifetime prevalence of ASD rose almost 400% (from 0.5% to 2%). For asthma, the rise was most prominent among the poor at 25.8%.

"28184204","Neuroscience of Childhood Poverty: Evidence of Impacts and Mechanisms as Vehicles of Dialog With Ethics.","Sebasti&#xe1;n J Lipina, Kathinka Evers","Several studies have identified associations between poverty and development of self-regulation during childhood, which is broadly defined as those skills involved in cognitive, emotional, and stress self-regulation. These skills are influenced by different individual and contextual factors at multiple levels of analysis (i.e., individual, family, social, and cultural). Available evidence suggests that the influences of those biological, psychosocial, and sociocultural factors on emotional and cognitive development can vary according to the type, number, accumulation of risks, and co-occurrence of adverse circumstances that are related to poverty, the time in which these factors exert their influences, and the individual susceptibility to them. Complementary, during the past three decades, several experimental interventions that were aimed at optimizing development of self-regulation of children who live in poverty have been designed, implemented, and evaluated. Their results suggest that it is possible to optimize different aspects of cognitive performance and that it would be possible to transfer some aspects of these gains to other cognitive domains and academic achievement. We suggest that it is an important task for ethics, notably but not exclusively neuroethics, to engage in this interdisciplinary research domain to contribute analyses of key concepts, arguments, and interpretations. The specific evidence that neuroscience brings to the analyses of poverty and its implications needs to be spelled out in detail and clarified conceptually, notably in terms of causes of and attitudes toward poverty, implications of poverty for brain development, and for the possibilities to reduce and reverse these effects.",2017,1,1,"Frontiers in psychology","10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00061","PMC5266697","Front Psychol","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.appdev.2015.12.005; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.15081014; 10.2307/1125869; 10.1126/science.1204534; 10.1186/1471-2458-13-835; 10.1038/4551057a; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2015.09.003; 10.1371/journal.pone.0112393; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01643.x; 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233; 10.1108/17466660200700003; 10.1111/1467-8624.00405; 10.2307/1602387; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2009.11.001; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.10.015; 10.1177/0963721414550704; 10.1111/mono.12271; 10.1016/j.dcn.2010.12.001; 10.1111/cdev.12391; 10.1126/science.1151148; 10.1017/S0954579413000667; 10.1002/wcs.1176; 10.1037/0894-4105.22.3.293; 10.1037/0003-066X.59.2.77; 10.1111/desc.12082; 10.15252/embr.201642783; 10.1038/nrn2649; 10.1016/j.gfs.2016.03.003; 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032814-112855; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181e1a23c; 10.1073/pnas.1320217111; 10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.003; 10.1038/nrn2897; 10.1111/desc.12246; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.1475; 10.1371/journal.pone.0018712; 10.1371/journal.pone.0080954; 10.1126/science.1128898; 10.1038/nrn1787; 10.1016/j.tine.2015.03.003; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2014.09.031; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.10.020; 10.1016/j.dr.2005.11.002; 10.1038/nrn2721; 10.3758/s13421-013-0364-z; 10.1371/journal.pone.0042486; 10.1542/peds.2015-3075; 10.1073/pnas.1308240110; 10.1162/jocn.2009.21101; 10.1097/00004583-200502000-00010; 10.1111/desc.12096; 10.1002/ijop.12282; 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00238; 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00053; 10.1111/desc.12080; 10.3102/0013189X032001014; 10.1016/S0893-133X(99)00129-3; 10.1038/nn.4086; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.10.012; 10.1177/0956247806069627; 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2003.03070.x; 10.1038/nn.3862; 10.1073/pnas.1304437110; 10.1037/0012-1649.41.1.99; 10.1038/nn.3983; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2012.01147.x; 10.1111/desc.12077; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00542.x; 10.1159/000216541; 10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2014.11.005; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.04.025; 10.3389/neuro.09.003.2010; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.01.021; 10.1037/0003-066X.53.2.109; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.07.003; 10.1038/nature.2015.17227; 10.1111/cdev.12270; 10.1016/j.ynstr.2014.11.001; 10.1111/j.1741-3737.2005.00188.x; 10.1073/pnas.0506897102; 10.1146/annurev.psych.121208.131619; 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00205; 10.1016/S0006-3223(02)01836-X; 10.1371/journal.pone.0035744; 10.1542/peds.2011-2663; 10.1542/peds.2013-1632; 10.1002/ana.22631; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00807.x; 10.1073/pnas.0030098100; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00745.x; 10.1111/desc.12079; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2004.03.011; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2010.00971.x; 10.1111/psyp.12547; 10.1016/j.dcn.2013.12.002; 10.1111/cdep.12125; 10.1111/j.1751-228X.2009.01075.x; 10.1186/1744-9081-2-19; 10.1038/nn1401; 10.1037/a0028015",NA,"Centre for Research Ethics and Bioethics (CRB), Uppsala Universitet Uppsala, Sweden."

The collection of 11 papers are published in 2 serial subsections of consecutive issues of the journal. The science they present captures the leading edge of work examining the interface of cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physiological self-regulation in parenting and how these operate to protect or increment risk for poorer parenting among families who face chronic stressors (e.g., poverty, single parenthood, homelessness, mood disorders). Samples span the poor to the affluent, many ethnicities, several nationalities, and a wide variety of geographic locations. The studies also are diverse in the methods employed, spanning behavioral and questionnaire indicators of executive function and effortful control, attentional and social-cognitive biases, and psychophysiology. Taken together, the papers present clear and compelling evidence for the crucial role of parental neurobiological and neurocognitive deficits and strengths in the etiology of distressed and resilient parenting.

The present study was designed to evaluate the link between socioeconomic status (SES), physical activity (PA), independence (I) and the health status (HS) of older people in Iran, using structural equation modelling. Using computerized randomly selection, a representative sample of 851 75-year-olds living in Tehran (2007-2008), Iran, was included. Participants answered questions regarding indicators of HS, SES and also PA and I through interviews. Both measurement and conceptual models of our hypotheses were tested using Mplus 5. Maximum-likelihood estimation with robust standard errors (MLR estimator), chi-square tests, the goodness of fit index (and degrees of freedom), as well as the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RSMEA) were used to evaluate the model fit.

This is an important research gap, given the rapid increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases associated with lifestyle changes in these countries. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the association between chronic conditions, multimorbidity and low physical activity (PA) among community-dwelling adults in 46 LMICs, and explore the mediators of these relationships. World Health Survey data included 228,024 adults aged &#x2265;18&#xa0;years from 46 LMICs. PA was assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Nine chronic physical conditions (chronic back pain, angina, arthritis, asthma, diabetes, hearing problems, tuberculosis, visual impairment and edentulism) were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analyses were used to assess the association between chronic conditions or multimorbidity and low PA. Overall, in the multivariable analysis, arthritis (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.12), asthma (1.19), diabetes (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.33), edentulism (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.46), hearing problems (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.90), tuberculosis (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.24), visual impairment (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.29), multimorbidity (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.31; 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.21-1.42) were significantly associated with low PA. More significant associations were observed in individuals aged &#x2265;50&#xa0;years. In older adults, depression mediated between 5.1% (visual impairment) to 23.5% (angina) of the association between a chronic condition and low PA. Mobility difficulties explained more than 25% of the association for seven of the eight chronic conditions. Pain was a strong mediator for angina (65.9%) and arthritis (64.9%), while sleep problems mediated up to 43.7% (angina) of the association. In LMICs, those with chronic conditions and multimorbidity are significantly less physically active (especially older adults). Research on the efficacy and effectiveness of PA in the management of chronic diseases in LMICs is urgently needed. Targeted promotion of physical activity to populations in LMICs experiencing chronic conditions may ameliorate associated depression, mobility difficulties and pain that are themselves important barriers for initiating or adopting an active lifestyle.",2017,1,18,"The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity","10.1186/s12966-017-0463-5","PMC5241915","Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act","eng","D000328; D000368; D000787; D001168; D002908; D015897; D003430; D003863; D003906; D003920; D015444; D005260; D014943; D006306; D006801; D007182; D008019; D016015; D008297; D008875; D051346; D010146; D011203; D015995; D012890; D055815","Adult; Aged; Angina Pectoris; Arthritis; Chronic Disease; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Developing Countries; Diabetes Mellitus; Exercise; Female; Global Health; Health Surveys; Humans; Income; Life Style; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Mobility Limitation; Pain; Poverty; Prevalence; Sleep; Young Adult",NA,"10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61340-X; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61729-2; 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.004046; 10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-204627; 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60692-4; 10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-204428; 10.1111/odi.12428; 10.1093/eurpub/ckr176; 10.4081/idr.2016.6570; 10.1016/j.ophtha.2013.05.025; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61696-1; 10.1370/afm.1337; 10.1371/journal.pone.0102149; 10.1080/13814780802436093; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60482-6; 10.1186/1477-7525-2-51; 10.1177/1077558711399580; 10.1007/s11606-015-3524-y; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60240-2; 10.1111/sms.12581; 10.1249/MSS.0b013e318206c66e; 10.1136/bjsports-2014-094306; 10.1186/1471-2458-14-1170; 10.1186/s12966-016-0330-9; 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00128-2; 10.1001/jama.2013.184182; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61240-9; 10.1007/s00038-015-0680-0; 10.1016/j.pmedr.2015.11.009; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61415-9; 10.3109/09638288.2011.587090; 10.1371/journal.pone.0063315; 10.1093/ije/dyq238; 10.1186/s12916-016-0734-z; 10.1093/schbul/sbq099; 10.1111/acps.12010; 10.1017/S0033291716001422; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.04.003; 10.1371/journal.pone.0114742; 10.1177/0049124113494572; 10.5665/sleep.5232; 10.1177/0269215514538069; 10.1186/s13075-015-0533-5; 10.1016/j.jbspin.2015.10.002; 10.1017/S0950268813002070; 10.1016/S1473-3099(16)00070-0; 10.1097/01.hjr.0000086303.28200.50; 10.1111/jgs.12938; 10.1123/apaq.2013-0039; 10.1111/j.1741-2358.2007.00196.x; 10.1186/s13033-016-0057-7; 10.1177/1359105307076232; 10.1016/j.schres.2015.02.015; 10.1016/j.jad.2013.10.051; 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2015.11.008; 10.7326/M14-1651; 10.1093/gerona/glq208",NA,"Physiotherapy Department, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill, London, SE5 8AZ, UK."

Molecular approaches for revealing premorbid risk factors.","Monica Uddin, Stefan Jansen, Eva H Telzer","The means by which social environmental exposures influence risk of mental disorders is a persistent and still open question. A key candidate mechanism for the biologic mediation of environmental effects involves epigenetic factors, which regulate gene function without altering underlying DNA sequence. Recent work has shown that environmental exposures such as childhood abuse, family history of mental disorder, and low socioeconomic status (SES) associate with differential DNA methylation (5mC) - a relatively stable, but modifiable, epigenetic factor. However, the longitudinal relation among SES, 5mC, brain function, and risk of depression remains to be elucidated. Here, we briefly review literature relevant to these associations and discuss recent findings that, for the first time, prospectively demonstrate sequential links between low SES, changes in 5mC, changes in brain function, and risk of depression in a cohort of adolescents.",2017,3,1,"BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology","10.1002/bies.201600194",NA,"Bioessays","eng","D000293; D019175; D003863; D044127; D006801; D012307; D012923","Adolescent; DNA Methylation; Depression; Epigenesis, Genetic; Humans; Risk Factors; Social Class",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."
"28073390","The behavioural constellation of deprivation: Causes and consequences.","Gillian V Pepper, Daniel Nettle","Socioeconomic differences in behaviour are pervasive and well documented, but their causes are not yet well understood. Here, we make the case that a cluster of behaviours is associated with lower socioeconomic status (SES), which we call ""the behavioural constellation of deprivation."" We propose that the relatively limited control associated with lower SES curtails the extent to which people can expect to realise deferred rewards, leading to more present-oriented behaviour in a range of domains. We illustrate this idea using the specific factor of extrinsic mortality risk, an important factor in evolutionary theoretical models. We emphasise the idea that the present-oriented behaviours of the constellation are a contextually appropriate response to structural and ecological factors rather than a pathology or a failure of willpower. We highlight some principles from evolutionary theoretical models that can deepen our understanding of how socioeconomic inequalities can become amplified and embedded. These principles are that (1) small initial disparities can lead to larger eventual inequalities, (2) feedback loops can embed early-life circumstances, (3) constraints can breed further constraints, and (4) feedback loops can operate over generations. We discuss some of the mechanisms by which SES may influence behaviour. We then review how the contextually appropriate response perspective that we have outlined fits with other findings about control and temporal discounting. Finally, we discuss the implications of this interpretation for research and policy.",2017,1,1,"The Behavioral and brain sciences","10.1017/S0140525X1600234X",NA,"Behav Brain Sci","eng","D005075; D003467; D065786; D005260; D006801; D008297; D011610; D012201; D012307; D012309; D012919; D012923; D012959","Biological Evolution; Cultural Deprivation; Delay Discounting; Female; Humans; Male; Psychosocial Deprivation; Reward; Risk Factors; Risk-Taking; Social Behavior; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors",NA,"NA",NA,"Institute of Neuroscience,Newcastle University,Newcastle NE2 4HH,United"

Previous work has suggested hyperactive neural response to social fear cues, as well as impairment in neural regulatory functions. However, despite differences found between males and females in stress-related and anxiety disorders, possible sex-specific effects of poverty on emotional processing have not been explored. We analyzed data from three previously reported experiments of childhood poverty effects on emotional processing and regulation, for sex-specific effects. Participants were 52 healthy Caucasian males and females, from a longitudinal cohort of poverty development study, who were recruited for examining the long-term effects of childhood poverty and stress. The three functional MRI studies included emotion regulation task, emotional face assessment task, and shifted attention emotion appraisal task. Brain activations that associated with childhood poverty previously were entered into a regression analysis with interaction of gender by childhood income-to-need ratio as the independent variable, and age and current income-to-need ratio as variables of no interest, separately for males and females. Amygdala reactivity to implicitly processed fearful faces was positively correlated with childhood income-to-need in adult females but not males. On the other hand, activation in dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal regions during emotion regulation by reappraisal was positively correlated with childhood income-to-need in males. Childhood poverty may exert sex-specific effects in adulthood as presented by hypersensitive emotional reactivity of the amygdala in females, and impaired emotion regulatory function of the prefrontal cortex in males.

To examine the developmental pathways that lead to first-episode adolescent-onset MDD (incident cases) in those at high familial risk and to postulate a theoretically informed model that enables simultaneous testing of different pathways to incident adolescent-onset MDD composed of contributions from familial/genetic and social risk factors, as well as effects via specific clinical antecedents. This investigation was a 4-year longitudinal study (April 2007 to March 2011) among offspring of depressed parents in the general community. Analyses were conducted between September 1, 2015, and May 27, 2016. Participants were 337 families in whom the index parent (315 mothers and 22 fathers) had experienced at least 2 episodes of MDD (recruited through primary care) and among whom there was a biologically related child in the age range of 9 to 17 years living with the index parent (197 girls and 140 boys with a mean [SD] age of 12.4 [2.0] years) at baseline. Offspring with MDD before the study or at baseline (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;27), offspring with an episode of MDD that had remitted by follow-up (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4), and offspring with missing baseline MDD data (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2) were excluded. Ninety-two percent (279 of 304) of families completed the follow-up. The primary outcome was new-onset offspring MDD, and the secondary outcome was the total DSM-IV MDD symptom score. On average, children and adolescents had a mean (SD) of 1.85 (1.74) (range, 0-8.5) DSM-IV symptoms of MDD at follow-up. Twenty (6 males and 14 females) had new-onset MDD, with a mean (SD) age at onset of 14.4 (2.0) years (range, 10-18 years). Irritability (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.12, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.03) and fear and/or anxiety (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.38, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) were significant independent clinical antecedents of new adolescent-onset MDD, but disruptive behavior (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.08, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.14) and low mood (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.03, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.65) were not. The results were similar for the DSM-IV symptom count at follow-up. All the measured familial/genetic and social risk indicators directly influenced risk for new-onset MDD rather than indirectly through acting on dimensional clinical antecedents. There are multiple pathways to first-onset adolescent depression in individuals at familial risk. Irritability and fear/anxiety may be additional clinical phenomena to be included as targets in primary preventive interventions focusing on the child. In addition to targeting these phenomena in parents and children, depression prevention methods in high-risk groups may need to take into consideration social risks, such as poverty and psychosocial adversity.",2017,2,1,"JAMA psychiatry","10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.3140",NA,"JAMA Psychiatry","eng","D000293; D002648; D003865; D039721; D005260; D020022; D006801; D008137; D008297; D011203; D011446; D011610; D012306","Adolescent; Child; Depressive Disorder, Major; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Poverty; Prospective Studies; Psychosocial Deprivation; Risk","MR/L010305/1","NA",NA,"Medical Research Council Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, Wales."

A cross-sectional study was carried out to develop age- and sex-specific norms for EFs using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Preschool Version (BRIEF-P) among 2- to 5-year-olds from urban Bangalore, India. In addition, the association between EFs and anthropometric measures, a marker of nutritional status, is also examined. Primary caregivers of 412 children, equally distributed by age and sex, participated. Raw scores for each domain and indices were converted to standard t-scores and percentiles were computed. A t-score at or above 63 corresponding to the 90th percentile was considered as the cutoff for executive dysfunction in this sample. The prevalence of executive dysfunction is 10% based on the Global Executive Composite score of the BRIEF-P. The cutoff score for identifying executive dysfunction using existing United States (US) norms is higher compared to the cutoff score obtained in the current study. Therefore, using US norms for Indian children could result in the prevalence of executive dysfunction been underestimated. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that stunted and underweight children have significantly elevated EF scores after adjusting for age, sex and socioeconomic status (SES; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.01). A greater understanding of EFs in preschool children is important for the early identification of executive dysfunction and implementing interventions to improve their future prospects.

How to accurately measure these conditions is a point of debate in the current literature on child development, health, and social determinants. We have evaluated four existing indices of socioeconomic status (SES) to determine the most relevant for the analysis of early childhood development (ECD) in Canada. Following a literature review of published SES indices which used 2006 Canadian Census data, four indices were chosen based on their relevance to ECD and the number of citations in subsequent articles. These were: the Canadian Deprivation Index, the Socioeconomic Factor Index, the Canadian Marginalization Index and an index created by the Early Childhood Mapping Project in Alberta, Canada. The indices were replicated using SES data for 2038 customized geographic neighbourhoods encompassing 99.9% of the Canadian population, and the relationship of the indices to ECD was investigated by linking to aggregated data from the Early Development Instrument (EDI), a teacher-completed questionnaire used to assess kindergarten children's physical, social, emotional, and cognitive development, and communication skills. The derived SES indices were compared based on four criteria: the input variables used, the index structure, the interpretability of the index and the variance they explained (R<sup>2</sup>) in the different EDI outcome measures. In terms of variance explained, material components of the SES indices (e.g., income, education) consistently showed the strongest association with children's language and cognitive development. The patterns of association for the non-material SES components and the other developmental domains of the EDI were more complex. We discuss the findings in regard to current developments in the field, and the need for refining empirical and theoretical approaches to examine associations between different facets of SES contextual factors and different aspects of ECD outcomes.",2017,12,1,"SSM - population health","10.1016/j.ssmph.2016.11.006","PMC5769026","SSM Popul Health","eng",NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,"Saskatchewan Population Health and Evaluation Research Unit, University of Saskatchewan, 104 Clinic Road, Saskatoon, SK, Canada S7N 5E5."

In adults, prosocial behavior toward strangers is markedly decreased in low socio-economic status (SES) neighborhoods, suggesting that environmental harshness has a negative impact on some prosocial behaviors. Similar results have been obtained with 9-year-olds recruited from low vs. high SES schools. In the current study, we investigate whether these findings generalize to a younger age group and a developing country. Specifically, we worked with a sample of thirty-nine 6- to 7-year-olds in two neighborhoods in a single city in Romania.

Compared with the average non-welfare-recipient image, the average welfare-recipient image was perceived (by a separate sample) as more African American and more representative of stereotypes associated with welfare recipients and African Americans. In Study 3, participants were asked to determine whether they supported giving welfare benefits to the people pictured in the average welfare-recipient and non-welfare-recipient images generated in Study 2.

However, little is known about physical health multimorbidity in this population or in people with subclinical psychosis and in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study explores physical health multimorbidity patterns among people with psychosis or subclinical psychosis. Overall, data from 242,952 individuals from 48 LMICs, recruited via the World Health Survey, were included in this cross-sectional study. Participants were subdivided into those (1) with a lifetime diagnosis of psychosis (""psychosis""); (2) with more than one psychotic symptom in the past 12&#xa0;months, but no lifetime diagnosis of psychosis (""subclinical psychosis""); and (3) without psychotic symptoms in the past 12&#xa0;months or a lifetime diagnosis of psychosis (""controls""). Nine operationalized somatic disorders were examined: arthritis, angina pectoris, asthma, diabetes, chronic back pain, visual impairment, hearing problems, edentulism, and tuberculosis. The association between psychosis and multimorbidity was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of multimorbidity (i.e., two or more physical health conditions) was: controls&#x2009;=&#x2009;11.4% (95% CI, 11.0-11.8%); subclinical psychosis&#x2009;=&#x2009;21.8% (95% CI, 20.6-23.0%), and psychosis&#x2009;=&#x2009;36.0% (95% CI, 32.1-40.2%) (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). After adjustment for age, sex, education, country-wise wealth, and country, subclinical psychosis and psychosis were associated with 2.20 (95% CI, 2.02-2.39) and 4.05 (95% CI, 3.25-5.04) times higher odds for multimorbidity. Moreover, multimorbidity was increased in subclinical and established psychosis in all age ranges (18-44, 45-64, &#x2265; 65&#xa0;years). However, multimorbidity was most evident in younger age groups, with people aged 18-44 years with psychosis at greatest odds of physical health multimorbidity (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.68; 95% CI, 3.46-6.32). This large multinational study demonstrates that physical health multimorbidity is increased across the psychosis-spectrum. Most notably, the association between multimorbidity and psychosis was stronger among younger adults, thus adding further impetus to the calls for the early intervention efforts to prevent the burden of physical health comorbidity at later stages.

Participants were primary caregivers and children aged 7 to 15&#xa0;years (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;479 families). Families were randomly assigned to receive an adapted version of the Strengthening Families Program (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;240) or a wait-list control condition (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;239). Assessments were conducted at baseline and 1-month post-intervention for both conditions and at 6&#xa0;months for treatment group only. One month after the program, children in the treatment condition showed significant reductions in externalizing problems (caregiver effect size (ES) -0.22, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02; child report ES -0.11, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) and child attention problems compared with controls (caregiver report ES -0.23, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03). There was no significant treatment effect on children's internalizing problems (ES -0.06; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.31).

Exploring new food items with improved dietary nutrition factors may, therefore, help to decrease the mortality rate in the poor countries like Bangladesh. Accordingly, the present study was a proximate composition and fatty acid analysis of <i>L. purpureus</i> seed-a legume seed which is given no careful attention locally, though it might be a good source of valuable nutrition factors for both animals and humans. The purpose of the study was, therefore, to generate awareness that <i>L. purpureus</i> could also act as a good source of food components essential for good health. Proximate analysis revealed that the seed powder contained 8.47&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.52% moisture; 3.50&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.0.07% ash; 1.02&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.06% total fat; 23.95&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.15% total protein; 1.21&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.16% total dietary fiber; 61.86&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.70% total carbohydrate and 352.4&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.66&#xa0;kcal/100&#xa0;g energy. Phytic acid content (%) was 1.014&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.048. Major fatty acid composition (%): the essential fatty acid linoleic acid (C18:2, &#x3c9;-6) was 9.50&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.68, while the linolenic acid (C18:3, &#x3c9;-3) was 1.95&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.18.

"27842184","Socioeconomic Disparities in Childhood Obesity Risk: Association With an Oxytocin Receptor Polymorphism.","Nicole R Bush, Amber L Allison, Alison L Miller, Julianna Deardorff, Nancy E Adler, W Thomas Boyce","Pediatricians are paying increased attention to the effects of socioeconomic status (SES) on children's health. Low SES is a robust predictor of obesity across the life course and may interact with genes affecting metabolism to influence obesity risk. Recent animal literature and burgeoning human research suggest that the hormone oxytocin (OT) may be important for metabolic regulation. To date, this association has not been examined in children. To examine whether an OT receptor polymorphism (rs53576) interacts with SES, potentially exacerbating and buffering the effects of stress, to predict anthropometry during childhood, and based on differential neurobiological susceptibility theory, to test whether carriers of the A allele of the OXTR gene, compared with GG genotyped individuals, would be most sensitive to the effects of SES on anthropometry for better or for worse. In this observational study, families were recruited from public school classrooms and enrolled in the Peers and Wellness Study (PAWS), which examined the effects of social status on health. Families were assessed during children's kindergarten year (fall semester of 2003, 2004, and 2005) and again during middle childhood (2009-2011) for a follow-up assessment that included anthropometric measures and DNA collection. The dates of the analysis were January 2015 to June 2016. Socioeconomic disparities. Child body mass index z score (BMIz) and triceps skinfold thickness. Family SES was collected through questionnaires mailed to homes. Body measurements and DNA were collected in homes by trained research assistants. From the original community sample of 338 typically developing children, participants were 186 socioeconomically and racially/ethnically diverse children (mean age, 10.3 years; age range, 9.4-11.3 years; 93 females [50%]) who had sufficient data at the follow-up assessment for inclusion in this study. Among 97 A allele carriers, a 1-SD increase in SES was associated with a decrease in BMIz of 0.28 (95% CI, -0.47 to -0.09) and a decrease in skinfold thickness of 0.95 (95% CI, -1.77 to -0.12) mm, such that they exhibited the highest BMIz and skinfold thickness in contexts of low SES but exhibited the lowest BMIz and skinfold thickness in contexts of high SES. Socioeconomic status was unrelated to BMIz (95% CI, -0.21 to 0.26) or skinfold thickness (95% CI, -0.42 to 1.45) for 89 GG genotyped children. These findings advance etiologic understanding of childhood obesity, highlighting complex effects of SES on child health and adding to growing evidence that OT relates to human obesity risk. The results also support differential neurobiological susceptibility theory, suggesting that the A allele renders individuals more sensitive to both positive and negative health effects of socioecological context.",2017,1,1,"JAMA pediatrics","10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.2332",NA,"JAMA Pediatr","eng","D000483; D000886; D002648; D005260; D020022; D005838; D006801; D008297; D063766; D018045; D012307; D012923; D012959","Alleles; Anthropometry; Child; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Humans; Male; Pediatric Obesity; Receptors, Oxytocin; Risk Factors; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors","R21 HD056581","NA",NA,"Center for Health and Community, Weill Neuroscience Institute, Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco2Division of Developmental Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco6School of Population and Public Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."
"27831702","Effects of a classroom intervention with spatial play materials on children's object and viewer transformation abilities.","Karin M Vander Heyden, Mariette Huizinga, Jelle Jolles","Children practice their spatial skills when playing with spatial toys, such as construction materials, board games, and puzzles. Sex and SES differences are observed in the engagement in such spatial play activities at home, which relate to individual differences in spatial performance. The current study investigated the effects of explicitly providing spatial play activities in the school setting on different types of spatial ability. We presented 8- to 10-year-old children with a short and easy-to-adopt classroom intervention comprising a set of different spatial play materials. The design involved a pretest-posttest comparison between the intervention group (n = 70) and a control group without intervention (n = 70). Effects were examined on object transformation ability (i.e., a paper-and-pencil mental rotation and paper folding task) and viewer transformation ability (i.e., a hands-on 3D spatial perspective-taking task). Results showed specific effects: there were no differences between the intervention and control group in progress on the two object transformation tasks. Substantial improvements were found for the intervention group compared to the control group on the viewer transformation task. Training progress was not related to sex and socioeconomic background of the child. These findings support the value of spatial play in the classroom for the spatial development of children between 8 and 10 years of age.

Further, neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia have also been associated with latent toxoplasmosis. Previously, we found no association between T. gondii immunoglobulin G antibody (IgG) seropositivity and depression in human adults between the ages of 20 and 39 years (n = 1 846) in a sample representative of the United States collected by the Centers for Disease Control as part of a National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from three datasets collected between 1999-2004. In the present study, we used NHANES data collected between 2009 and 2012 that included subjects aged 20 to 80 years (n = 5 487) and used the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) to assess depression with the overall aim of testing the stability of the results of the prior study. In the current study, the seroprevalence of T. gondii was 13%. The percentage of subjects reporting clinical levels of depression assessed with the PHQ-9 was 8%. As before, we found no association between T. gondii IgG seroprevalence and depression (OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.81-1.25; p = 0.944) while controlling for sex, educational attainment, race-ethnicity, age, poverty-to-income ratio and cigarette smoking. We also found no positive associations between anti-T. gondii antibody titre and depression (OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.96-1.06; p = 0.868).

However, there have been few reports assessing how health disparities impact pediatric patients with malignancies. The objective in this study was to examine the impact of racial/ethnic and social factors on disease presentation and outcome for children with primary CNS solid tumors. METHODS The authors examined all children (age &#x2264; 18 years) in whom CNS solid tumors were diagnosed and who were enrolled in the Texas Cancer Registry between 1995 and 2009 (n = 2421). Geocoded information was used to calculate the driving distance between a patient's home and the nearest pediatric cancer treatment center. Socioeconomic status (SES) was determined using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality formula and 2007-2011 US Census block group data. Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with advanced-stage disease. Survival probability and hazard ratios were calculated using life table methods and Cox regression. RESULTS Children with advanced-stage CNS solid tumors were more likely to be &lt; 1 year old, Hispanic, and in the lowest SES quartile (all p &lt; 0.05). The adjusted odds ratios of presenting with advanced-stage disease were higher in children &lt; 1 year old compared with children &gt; 10 years old (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.06-2.75), and in Hispanic patients compared with non-Hispanic white patients (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.19-2.04). Distance to treatment and SES did not impact disease stage at presentation in the adjusted analysis. Furthermore, 1- and 5-year survival probability were worst in children 1-10 years old, Hispanic patients, non-Hispanic black patients, and those in the lowest SES quartile (p &lt; 0.05). In the adjusted survival model, only advanced disease and malignant behavior were predictive of mortality. CONCLUSIONS Racial/ethnic disparities are associated with advanced-stage disease presentation for children with CNS solid tumors.

We hypothesized that experience communicating in two languages provides an enriched linguistic environment that can bolster neural precision in subcortical auditory processing which, in turn, enhances cognitive and linguistic function, regardless of the adolescent's socioeconomic standing. Consistent with this, we report that adolescent bilinguals of both low and high SES demonstrate more stable neural responses, stronger phonemic decoding skills, and heightened executive control, relative to their monolingual peers. These results support the argument that bilingualism can bolster cognitive and neural function in low-SES children and suggest that strengthened neural response consistency provides a biological mechanism through which these enhancements occur.",2016,11,1,"Developmental science","10.1111/desc.12347",NA,"Dev Sci","eng","D000293; D003056; D056344; D005260; D006801; D007802; D008297; D019303; D012677; D012959","Adolescent; Cochlear Nerve; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Language; Male; Multilingualism; Sensation; Socioeconomic Factors",NA,"NA",NA,"Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory (www.brainvolts.northwestern.edu), Northwestern University, USA."

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, ScieELO, Google Scholar and Cochrane databases for studies reporting evidence, experience or evaluation of capacity-building of policy-makers, service planners or managers in mental health system strengthening in LMICs. Reports in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French or German were included. Additional papers were identified by hand-searching references and contacting experts and key informants. Database searches yielded 2922 abstracts and 28 additional papers were identified. Following screening, 409 full papers were reviewed, of which 14 fulfilled inclusion criteria for the review. Data were extracted from all included papers and synthesized into a narrative review. Only a small number of mental health system-related capacity-building interventions for policy-makers and planners in LMICs were described. Most models of capacity-building combined brief training with longer term mentorship, dialogue and/or the establishment of networks of support. However, rigorous research and evaluation methods were largely absent, with studies being of low quality, limiting the potential to separate mental health system strengthening outcomes from the effects of associated contextual factors.

"27744097","The application of neuroimaging to social inequity and language disparity: A cautionary examination.","Monica E Ellwood-Lowe, Matthew D Sacchet, Ian H Gotlib","In the nascent field of the cognitive neuroscience of socioeconomic status (SES), researchers are using neuroimaging to examine how growing up in poverty affects children's neurocognitive development, particularly their language abilities. In this review we highlight difficulties inherent in the frequent use of reverse inference to interpret SES-related abnormalities in brain regions that support language. While there is growing evidence suggesting that SES moderates children's developing brain structure and function, no studies to date have elucidated explicitly how these neural findings are related to variations in children's language abilities, or precisely what it is about SES that underlies or contributes to these differences. This issue is complicated by the fact that SES is confounded with such linguistic factors as cultural language use, first language, and bilingualism. Thus, SES-associated differences in brain regions that support language may not necessarily indicate differences in neurocognitive abilities. In this review we consider the multidimensionality of SES, discuss studies that have found SES-related differences in structure and function in brain regions that support language, and suggest future directions for studies in the area of cognitive neuroscience of SES that are less reliant on reverse inference.",2016,12,1,"Developmental cognitive neuroscience","10.1016/j.dcn.2016.10.001","PMC5135574","Dev Cogn Neurosci","eng","D001076; D001921; D002648; D002657; D002675; D003467; D005260; D006801; D007802; D007804; D008297; D019303; D059906; D012923","Aptitude; Brain; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Cultural Deprivation; Female; Humans; Language; Language Development; Male; Multilingualism; Neuroimaging; Social Class","R01 MH101495","NA",NA,"Department of Psychology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Neurosciences Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."

The strongest pre-literacy predictors of dyslexia are rapid automatized naming (RAN), phonological awareness (PA), letter knowledge, and verbal short-term memory. The relationship among these constructs has been debated, and several theories have emerged to explain the unique role of each in reading ability/disability. Furthermore, the stability of identification of risk based on these measures varies widely across studies, due in part to the different cut-offs employed to designate risk. We applied a latent profile analysis technique with a diverse sample of 1215 kindergarten and pre-kindergarten students from 20 schools, to investigate whether PA, RAN, letter knowledge, and verbal short-term memory measures differentiated between homogenous profiles of performance on these measures. Six profiles of performance emerged from the data: average performers, below average performers, high performers, PA risk, RAN risk, and double-deficit risk (both PA and RAN). A latent class regression model was employed to investigate the longitudinal stability of these groups in a representative subset of children (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;95) nearly two years later, at the end of 1st grade. Profile membership in the spring semester of pre-kindergarten or fall semester of kindergarten was significantly predictive of later reading performance, with the specific patterns of performance on the different constructs remaining stable across the years. There was a higher frequency of PA and RAN deficits in children from lower socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds. There was no evidence for the IQ-achievement discrepancy criterion traditionally used to diagnose dyslexia. Our results support the feasibility of early identification of dyslexia risk and point to the heterogeneity of risk profiles. These findings carry important implications for improving outcomes for children with dyslexia, based on more targeted interventions.",2017,9,1,"Developmental science","10.1111/desc.12471","PMC5393968","Dev Sci","eng","D001364; D002657; D002675; D032882; D005260; D005500; D006801; D007807; D008137; D008297; D008570; D009511; D011582; D011932; D014706; D014825","Awareness; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Comprehension; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Language Tests; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Memory, Short-Term; New England; Psychological Theory; Reading; Verbal Learning; Vocabulary","R01 HD065762; R01 HD067312; U54 HD090255","NA",NA,"Laboratories of Cognitive Neuroscience, Division of Developmental Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, USA."

The biopsychosocial model of depression and prevailing socioeconomic hardships for older people in LMICs have provided the impetus to determine the prevalence of geriatric depression; to study its associations with health, social, and economic variables; and to investigate socioeconomic inequalities in depression prevalence in LMICs. The authors accessed the World Health Organization Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health Wave 1 data that studied nationally representative samples from six large LMICs (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;14,877). A computerized algorithm derived depression diagnoses. The authors assessed hypothesized associations using survey multivariate logistic regression models for each LMIC and pooled their risk estimates by meta-analyses and investigated related socioeconomic inequalities using concentration indices. Cross-national prevalence of geriatric depression was 4.7% (95% CI: 1.9%-11.9%). Female gender, illiteracy, poverty, indebtedness, past informal-sector occupation, bereavement, angina, and stroke had significant positive associations, whereas pension support and health insurance showed significant negative associations with geriatric depression. Pro-poor inequality of geriatric depression were documented in five LMICs. Socioeconomic factors and related inequalities may predispose, precipitate, or perpetuate depression amongolder people in LMICs. Relative absence of health safety net places socioeconomically disadvantaged older people in LMICs at risk.

The study comprised black (n = 10,274, 41%) and white (n = 14,601) stroke-free participants, aged 45 and older, enrolled in 2003-2007 in Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS), a national population-based cohort. A neighborhood socioeconomic score (nSES) was constructed using 6 neighborhood variables. Incident stroke was defined as first occurrence of stroke over an average 7.5 (SD 3.0) years of follow-up. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate associations between nSES score and incident stroke, adjusted for demographics (age, race, sex, region), individual socioeconomic status (SES) (education, household income), and other risk factors for stroke. After adjustment for demographics, compared to the highest nSES quartile, stroke incidence increased with each decreasing nSES quartile. The hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) ranged from 1.28 (1.05-1.56) in quartile 3 to 1.38 (1.13-1.68) in quartile 2 to 1.56 (1.26-1.92) in quartile 1 (p &lt; 0.0001 for linear trend). After adjustment for individual SES, the trend remained marginally significant (p = 0.085). Although there was no evidence of a differential effect by race or sex, adjustment for stroke risk factors attenuated the association between nSES and stroke in both black and white participants, with greater attenuation in black participants. Risk of incident stroke increased with decreasing nSES but the effect of nSES is attenuated through individual SES and stroke risk factors.

In Nepal the use of open stoves with solid biomass fuels is the primary method of domestic cooking. To assess patterns of domestic air pollution we performed continuous measurement of carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate Matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) in 12 biomass fuel households in Janakpur, Nepal. We measured kitchen PM<sub>2.5</sub> and CO concentrations at one-minute intervals for an approximately 48-h period using the TSI DustTrak II 8530/SidePak AM510 (TSI Inc, St. Paul MN, USA) or EL-USB-CO data logger (Lascar Electronics, Erie PA, USA) respectively. We also obtained information regarding fuel, stove and kitchen characteristics and cooking activity patterns. Household cooking was performed in two daily sessions (median total duration 4&#xa0;h) with diurnal variability in pollutant concentrations reflecting morning and evening cooking sessions and peak concentrations associated with fire-lighting. We observed a strong linear relationship between PM<sub>2.5</sub> measurements obtained by co-located photometric and gravimetric monitoring devices, providing local calibration factors of 4.9 (DustTrak) and 2.7 (SidePak).

Maternal childhood adversity scores were derived using an integrated measure derived from the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and the Parental Bonding Index (PBI). Maternal depression was measured in the prenatal period with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). SES measures included maternal highest level of education and family income as obtained prenatally. The analyses yielded significant interaction effects between maternal childhood adversity and prenatal depression that predicted income, prenatally. Women who reported higher levels of childhood adversity combined with higher levels of self-reported depressive symptoms were significantly more likely to live in low SES environments. Results also showed that level of education was predicted by childhood adversity independent of maternal symptoms of depression. The results suggest that SES is influenced by a life course pathway that begins in childhood and includes adversity-related mental health outcomes. Since child health and development is influenced by both maternal mental health and SES, this pathway may also contribute to the intergenerational transmission of the risk for psychopathology in the offspring.

"27604273","Development and validation of a contextual measure of functioning for people living with severe mental disorders in rural Africa.","Kassahun Habtamu, Atalay Alem, Girmay Medhin, Abebaw Fekadu, Martin Prince, Charlotte Hanlon","Most measures of functioning in people with severe mental disorders (SMD) have been developed in Western societies. Many of the questions in these scales are culture-bound, fail to capture differentiation of tasks by gender and are difficult to adapt to other contexts. The aim of this study was to develop a measure of functioning for people with SMD which is contextually appropriate for a rural African setting. A review of existing scales, a qualitative study, free listing and pile sorting exercises, and expert consensus were used to establish a pool of items. Cognitive interviewing guided initial item reduction and refinement. The resulting scale was pilot-tested in people with SMD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;200) and their caregivers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;200) to inform further item reduction based on psychometric properties. The final Butajira Functioning Scale (BFS) comprised 33 items that were common to both men and women, and an additional eight items for women only, covering the following domains: self-care, work, and family and community participation. Psychometric properties of the finalized BFS were examined in a facility-based sample of 150 people with SMD and their caregivers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;150), with longitudinal follow-up of n&#x2009;=&#x2009;84. The BFS in people with SMD had excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's &#x3b1;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.99), acceptable convergent validity (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.88 with the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule [WHODAS-2.0] and r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.32 with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS-E]) and was sensitive to change following treatment (effect size =0.50). Addition of the items specific to women did not improve the psychometric properties. The caregiver version had similar psychometric properties but higher mean values for each item and better responsiveness to change. Exploratory factor analysis of the BFS provided evidence of construct validity, with four underlying dimensions. We have developed a measure of functioning for people with SMD in a rural, low income country setting with acceptable psychometric properties. The BFS is easy to administer, sensitive to changes following treatment and has content, construct and convergent validity. The BFS includes domains from existing measures, but has more emphasis on social and occupational domains, which reflects priorities in the setting.",2016,9,7,"BMC psychiatry","10.1186/s12888-016-1022-3","PMC5015207","BMC Psychiatry","eng","D000328; D000349; D010054; D004185; D005163; D005260; D005500; D006801; D008137; D008297; D001523; D010865; D011203; D011594; D036301; D015203; D012424","Adult; Africa; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; Disability Evaluation; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mental Disorders; Pilot Projects; Poverty; Psychometrics; Qualitative Research; Reproducibility of Results; Rural Population","U19 MH095699","10.1111/j.1399-5618.2007.00327.x; 10.1186/1745-0179-3-5; 10.1046/j.1440-1614.2001.00846.x; 10.1186/s12888-015-0418-9; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2007.01108.x; 10.1177/1363461504043565; 10.1007/s00127-004-0763-3; 10.1097/00005053-200209000-00009; 10.1007/s00127-002-0580-5; 10.1590/S1516-44462006000200014; 10.4314/ajpsy.v12i3.48494; 10.3329/icpj.v1i4.10063; 10.1192/bjp.191.50.s71; 10.1016/S0920-9964(00)90482-1; 10.1186/1471-2458-10-390; 10.1017/S1121189X00001305; 10.1016/j.joca.2007.12.015; 10.3758/BRM.41.4.1149; 10.3758/BF03193146; 10.1007/s11136-014-0624-9; 10.2471/BLT.09.067231; 10.1186/s12963-014-0027-8; 10.1186/1477-7525-8-51; 10.1038/ejhg.2013.275; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002716; 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2012.04126.x; 10.1192/bjp.bp.105.019489; 10.1177/1363461508100783; 10.1016/S0895-4356(99)00206-1; 10.1192/bjp.157.6.853; 10.1097/00005650-199804000-00012; 10.1007/s11136-012-0212-9; 10.1016/j.ramb.2012.11.005; 10.1016/j.schres.2005.05.028; 10.1016/j.jad.2005.11.009; 10.1192/bjp.bp.105.013417; 10.1093/schbul/sbl035; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2006.08.003; 10.1176/ajp.2007.164.3.428",NA,"Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, P.O.BOX: 1176, Ethiopia."

A community sample of 2450 girls (43.9% African American) participating in the longitudinal Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS) was interviewed annually about depression symptoms and suicidal ideation, from ages 10-15 years. Caregivers reported on the girls' racial/ethnic background and the family's receipt of public assistance. Race and depression scores explained unique variance in suicidal ideation; receipt of public assistance did not. Endorsement and recurrence of suicidal ideation was more likely for African American than European American girls: there was a nearly two-fold increase in the likelihood of reporting frequent thoughts of death or suicide as a function of race. Of the 255 girls reporting recurrent suicidal ideation, 65.9% were African American. An interaction effect between race and depression symptoms was observed, such that African American girls were more likely to report suicidal ideation at lower levels of depression severity. The findings indicate that race is a critical factor for understanding, preventing, and treating suicidal ideation in girls.",2016,12,1,"Journal of adolescence","10.1016/j.adolescence.2016.08.013","PMC5116270","J Adolesc","eng","D000293; D001741; D002648; D003863; D005260; D006801; D008137; D008297; D011203; D015995; D057566; D059020; D014481; D044465","Adolescent; Black or African American; Child; Depression; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Poverty; Prevalence; Self Report; Suicidal Ideation; United States; White People","R01 MH056630; R01 MH066167","NA",NA,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA."
"27596808","Non-symbolic approximate arithmetic training improves math performance in preschoolers.","Joonkoo Park, Vanessa Bermudez, Rachel C Roberts, Elizabeth M Brannon","Math proficiency at early school age is an important predictor of later academic achievement. Thus, an important goal for society should be to improve math readiness in preschool-age children, especially in low-income children who typically arrive in kindergarten with less mathematical competency than their higher income peers. The majority of existing research-based math intervention programs target symbolic verbal number concepts in young children. However, very little attention has been paid to the preverbal intuitive ability to approximately represent numerical quantity, which is hypothesized to be an important foundation for full-fledged mathematical thinking. Here, we tested the hypothesis that repeated engagement of non-symbolic approximate addition and subtraction of large arrays of items results in improved math skills in very young children, an idea that stems from our previous studies in adults. In the current study, 3- to 5-year-olds showed selective improvements in math skills after multiple days of playing a tablet-based non-symbolic approximate arithmetic game compared with children who played a memory game. These findings, collectively with our previous reports, suggest that mental manipulation of approximate numerosities provides an important tool for improving math readiness, even in preschoolers who have yet to master the meaning of number words.",2016,12,1,"Journal of experimental child psychology","10.1016/j.jecp.2016.07.011","PMC5053875","J Exp Child Psychol","eng","D000073978; D001288; D002675; D005260; D006801; D007182; D008297; D008433; D008570; D011203; D012574; D013561; D013850","Academic Performance; Attention; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Income; Male; Mathematics; Memory, Short-Term; Poverty; Schools; Symbolism; Thinking","R01 HD079106","10.1007/BF03217428; 10.1177/0956797614547539; 10.1080/10409280802206619; 10.1177/1745691613491271; 10.2307/30035522; 10.2307/30034954; 10.1126/science.1204537; 10.1111/bjdp.12118; 10.1037/0012-1649.43.6.1428; 10.1177/0022219411410233; 10.1037/0022-0063.97.3.493; 10.1111/desc.12013; 10.1016/0010-0277(92)90050-R; 10.1371/journal.pone.0054651; 10.1016/0010-0277(94)90068-X; 10.1016/j.cognition.2010.02.002; 10.1177/0956797613516471; 10.1126/science.1094492; 10.1037/a0012682; 10.1073/pnas.1200196109; 10.1038/nature07246; 10.1016/j.cognition.2013.12.007; 10.3758/s13423-011-0154-1; 10.1073/pnas.0812142106; 10.1016/j.lindif.2009.07.004; 10.1111/j.1540-5826.2007.00229.x; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2006.00862.x; 10.1037/a0014939; 10.1037/0012-1649.42.1.59; 10.1016/j.learninstruc.2012.12.001; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2011.01080.x; 10.1016/j.cognition.2016.01.005; 10.1016/j.cognition.2011.07.009; 10.1016/j.lindif.2014.05.006; 10.1371/journal.pone.0023749; 10.1177/0956797613482944; 10.1016/j.cognition.2014.06.011; 10.1016/j.cognition.2016.02.012; 10.1177/0956797612464057; 10.1126/science.1102085; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01131.x; 10.1016/j.jecp.2012.10.012; 10.1037/a0014239; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2004.01.002; 10.1016/j.visres.2013.06.006; 10.1111/j.2044-8279.2011.02049.x; 10.1016/S0010-0277(99)00066-9; 10.1016/S0885-2014(96)90027-1",NA,"Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."

To determine how much CHWs would need to reduce emergency department (ED) visits and associated hospitalizations among their assigned patients to be cost-neutral from a payer's perspective. Using a microsimulation of patient health care utilization, costs, and revenues, we estimated what portion of ED visits and hospitalizations for different conditions would need to be prevented by a CHW program to fully pay for the program's expenses. The model simulated CHW programs enrolling patients with a history of at least 1 ED visit for a chronic condition in the prior year, utilizing data on utilization and cost from national sources. CHWs assigned to patients with uncontrolled hypertension and congestive heart failure, as compared with other common conditions, achieve cost-neutrality with the lowest number of averted visits to the ED. To achieve cost-neutrality, 4-5 visits to the ED would need to be averted per year by a CHW assigned a panel of 70 patients with uncontrolled hypertension or congestive heart failure-approximately 3%-4% of typical ED visits among such patients, respectively. Most other chronic conditions would require between 7% and 12% of ED visits to be averted to achieve cost-savings. Offsetting costs of a CHW program is theoretically feasible for many common conditions.

To document the clinical benefit of treatment in NF trials targeting these manifestations, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) assessing pain and physical functioning should be included as study endpoints. Currently, there is no consensus on the selection and use of such measures in the NF population. This article presents the recommendations of the PRO group of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration for assessing the domains of pain and physical functioning for NF clinical trials. The REiNS PRO group reviewed and rated existing PRO measures assessing pain intensity, pain interference, and physical functioning using their systematic method. Final recommendations are based primarily on 4 main criteria: patient characteristics, item content, psychometric properties, and feasibility for clinical trials.

The aim of this study was to inform delivery of a new primary care-based mental health service in rural Ethiopia by identifying potential barriers to equitable access to mental healthcare and strategies to overcome them. A qualitative study was conducted as formative work for the PRogramme for Improving Mental healthcarE (PRIME), a project supporting delivery of mental healthcare integrated into primary care in a rural district in south central Ethiopia. In-depth interviews (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21) were carried out with stakeholders selected purposively from mental health service users, caregivers, community leaders and healthcare administrators. A focus group discussion (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;12) was conducted with community health extension workers. Framework analysis was employed using an adapted version of the access framework developed for use in contexts of livelihood insecurity, which considers (1) availability, (2) accessibility and affordability. and (3) acceptability and adequacy dimensions of access. Primary care-based mental healthcare was considered as a positive development, and would increase availability, accessibility and affordability of treatments. Low levels of community awareness, and general preference for traditional and religious healing were raised as potential challenges to the acceptability of integrated mental healthcare. Participants believed integrated mental healthcare would be comprehensive and of satisfactory quality. However, expectations about the effectiveness of treatment for mental disorders were generally low. Threats to equitable access to mental healthcare were identified for perinatal women, persons with physical disability, those living in extreme poverty and people with severe and persistent mental disability. Establishing an affordable service within reach, raising awareness and financial support to families from low socioeconomic backgrounds were suggested to improve equitable access to mental healthcare by vulnerable groups including perinatal women and people with disabilities. Innovative approaches, such as telephone consultations with psychiatric nurses based in nearby towns and home outreach need to be developed and evaluated.",2016,7,26,"International journal for equity in health","10.1186/s12939-016-0410-0","PMC4962424","Int J Equity Health","eng","D005002; D006297; D054625; D006801; D001523; D008605; D011320; D036301","Ethiopia; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Primary Health Care; Qualitative Research","U19 MH110001","10.1093/schbul/sbn029; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1999.tb10693.x; 10.1186/1472-6963-13-256; 10.1186/1475-9276-12-30; 10.4314/ejhd.v21i2.10046; 10.1017/S0033291708003929; 10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00441-X",NA,"College of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia."

This study aims to explore the barriers and facilitators, as well as perceptions about the feasibility and acceptability of plans to deliver perinatal mental health care in primary care settings in a low income, rural district in Uganda. Six focus group discussions comprising separate groups of pregnant and postpartum women and village health teams as well as eight key informant interviews were conducted in the local language using a topic guide. Transcribed data were translated into English, analyzed, and coded. Key themes were identified using a thematic analysis approach. Participants perceived that there was an important unmet need for perinatal mental health care in the district. There was evidence of significant gaps in knowledge about mental health problems as well as negative attitudes amongst mothers and health care providers towards sufferers. Poverty and inability to afford transport to services, poor partner support and stigma were thought to add to the difficulties of perinatal women accessing care. There was an awareness of the need for interventions to respond to this neglected public health problem and a willingness of both community- and facility-based health care providers to provide care for mothers with mental health problems if equipped to do so by adequate training. This study highlights the acceptability and relevance of perinatal mental health care in a rural, low-income country community. It also underscores some of the key barriers and potential facilitators to delivery of such care in primary care settings.

Despite this, no empirical research to date has examined the impact of neurocognitive functioning on quality of life for this pediatric group. Thus, the current study aims to examine the relationship between executive functioning and quality of life in a sample of children with SCD and further explore psychosocial and family/caregiver resources as moderators of this relationship. A total of 45 children with SCD aged 8 to 16 years and their caregivers completed measures of quality of life, behavioral ratings of executive functioning, and psychosocial functioning. Hierarchical linear regression models were utilized to determine the impact of executive functioning on quality of life and further test the interaction effects of proposed moderating variables. Controlling for age, pain, and socioeconomic status (SES), executive functioning was found to significantly predict child- and parent-reported quality of life among youth with SCD. Psychosocial resources of the primary caregiver or family was not found to moderate the relationship between executive functioning and quality of life. These results provide the first empirical evidence that lower executive skills negatively predict quality of life for children with SCD, supporting clinical and research efforts which aim to establish efficacious interventions that target cognitive decrements within this pediatric population.",2017,11,1,"Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence","10.1080/09297049.2016.1205011",NA,"Child Neuropsychol","eng","D000293; D000755; D002648; D056344; D005260; D006801; D008297; D011788","Adolescent; Anemia, Sickle Cell; Child; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Male; Quality of Life",NA,"NA",NA,"a Department of Psychology &amp; Neuroscience , Duke University , Durham , NC , USA."

Most studies to date have examined the effectiveness of single-disorder mental health treatments - an approach that may be a significant challenge to scale-up and sustainability in lower resource settings. This paper presents a brief overview of the scientific progress in global mental health, and suggests consideration of an internal stepped care delivery approach. An internal stepped care model is one idea of a delivery system, utilizing a common elements approach, where the same provider could navigate between different elements based on severity and type of problems of the client. It is distinct from traditional stepped care models in that clients remain with the same provider, rather than relying on referral systems. An internal stepped care delivery system based on a simplified common elements approach could be more efficient, scalable, sustainable, and reduce the loss of clients to referrals in lower resource settings.",2016,7,12,"BMC psychiatry","10.1186/s12888-016-0938-y","PMC4941014","BMC Psychiatry","eng","D003695; D014943; D006801; D007182; D001523; D008603; D008605; D011203","Delivery of Health Care; Global Health; Humans; Income; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Poverty",NA,"10.1038/475027a; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61239-2; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61414-7; 10.1093/heapol/czl003; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60368-7; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61263-X; 10.1097/WTF.0000000000000070; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61385-8; 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61508-5; 10.1001/jama.289.23.3117; 10.1001/jama.298.5.519; 10.1056/NEJMoa1211853; 10.1037/0022-006X.76.4.686; 10.1159/000327253; 10.1001/jama.2011.1060; 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61400-2; 10.1016/j.brat.2011.06.012; 10.1016/j.chc.2008.03.002; 10.1186/1752-4458-7-24; 10.1097/WTF.0000000000000065; 10.3109/09540261.2014.966067; 10.1192/bjp.bp.109.065565; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61093-3; 10.1016/j.healthpol.2009.09.009; 10.1016/j.cbpra.2013.06.005; 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62382-X; 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032814-112820; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.07.057; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.06.004; 10.1007/s11020-005-1962-6; 10.1016/j.brat.2009.07.005; 10.1891/0889-8391.23.1.6; 10.1016/j.beth.2012.01.001; 10.1016/j.brat.2015.04.010; 10.1002/da.21974; 10.1002/da.22018; 10.1016/j.janxdis.2015.09.003; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.147; 10.1037/a0014565; 10.1186/s12888-015-0622-7; 10.1192/bjp.186.1.11; 10.1016/j.brat.2015.03.009",NA,"Center for Global Mental Health; Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, 16 De Crespigny Park, London SE5 8AF, London, UK."

The baseline data of 8916 participants of the Paris Prospective Study 3, an observational cohort on novel markers for future cardiovascular disease, were used. The AHA 7-item tool includes four health behaviours (smoking, body weight, physical activity and optimal diet) and three biological measures (blood cholesterol, blood glucose and blood pressure). A validated 11-item score of individual material and psychosocial deprivation, the Evaluation de la Pr&#xe9;carit&#xe9; et des In&#xe9;galit&#xe9;s dans les Centres d'Examens de Sant&#xe9;-Evaluation of Deprivation and Inequalities in Health Examination centres (EPICES) score was used. The mean age was 59.5&#x2005;years (standard deviation 6.2), 61.2% were men and 9.98% had an ideal CVH. In sex-specific multivariable polytomous logistic regression, the odds ratio (OR) for ideal behavioural CVH progressively decreased with quartile of increasing deprivation, from 0.54 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.72) to 0.49 (0.37 to 0.65) in women and from 0.61 (0.50 to 0.76) to 0.57 (0.46 to 0.71) in men. Associations with ideal biological CVH were confined to the most deprived women (OR=0.60; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.99), whereas in men, greater deprivation was related to higher OR of intermediate biological CVH (OR=1.28; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.57 for the third quartile vs the first quartile).

"27323755","Subjective Social Status and Psychological Distress in Mothers of Young Children.","Nicole Michelson, Jenna L Riis, Sara B Johnson","Introduction Perceptions of social standing have increasingly well-documented relationships with health. Higher subjective social status (SSS) is associated with better psychological well-being among women, and mothers of newborns. The relationship between SSS and psychological distress among mothers of young children, however, is largely unknown. SSS may provide insight into aspects of maternal functioning that are relevant to parenting capacity, as well as insight into future health; in addition, SSS is brief, and may be perceived as less intrusive than other measures of socioeconomic status or mental health. We evaluated the relationship between SSS and psychological distress among mothers of 5-year-old children from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Methods One hundred and sixty-two mothers of 5-year old children, who participated in a study of child self-regulation, completed surveys that assessed sociodemographics, mental health, and perceived social support. The MacArthur Scale of SSS used pictures of ten-rung ladders to assess respondents' social position in relation to the US (SES ladder) and their community (community ladder). Quantile regression models were used to assess the relationship between maternal psychological distress (perceived social support, depressive symptoms, anxiety) and the ladders (individually and together), adjusting for maternal age, race, education, and number of children. To examine whether the SSS-health relationships differed by race, the models were also stratified by race. Results Community ladder ranking was positively associated with social support (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.34, SE&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.33, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001), and negatively associated with depressive symptoms (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-1.34, SE&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.52, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.05). SES ladder ranking was positively associated with social support (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.17, SE&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.52, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.05). Findings in the full sample were driven by more robust relationships between psychological distress and community SSS among Black/African-American mothers. Discussion The findings suggest that perceived social standing in one's community is associated with maternal psychological well-being. Community SSS may be particularly influential for Black/African-American mothers' well-being.",2016,10,1,"Maternal and child health journal","10.1007/s10995-016-2027-8","PMC5025367","Matern Child Health J","eng","D000328; D001741; D044383; D002648; D003863; D005260; D054624; D006801; D008423; D009035; D012923; D012959; D013315; D011795; D055815","Adult; Black or African American; Black People; Child; Depression; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Maternal Age; Mothers; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","K01 DA027229; R01 HD027592","10.1111/1471-0528.12837",NA,"Department of Population, Family and Reproductive Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 200 N Wolfe St, Room 2017, Baltimore, MD, 21287, USA."

A cross-sectional, mixed (within and between group) design was used to compare a paediatric BT survivor group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;33) with an age-matched control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;34) on two multi-informant (self-report, parent, teacher) social competence questionnaires: Social Skills Improvement System (SSIS) and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). Demographic factors (age, gender, social economic status (SES), intellectual ability and emotional/behavioural difficulties were investigated as potential non-insult-related risk factors. Compared to controls, the BT group was reported to have difficulties in social adjustment, interactions and information processing, on both social competence questionnaire measures by parents and teachers, but not self-report. Social competence scores for the BT group were broadly distributed within the normal-severe clinical range, with 40&#xa0;% of BT survivors scoring in the clinical range for social competence difficulties on the SRS. Lower intellectual ability and emotional/behavioural difficulties accounted for some of the group differences in social competence, but group effects remained once estimated IQ and emotional/behavioural difficulties were controlled for. Paediatric BT survivors were reported by parents and teachers to have significant difficulties at all three levels of social competence: adjustment, interaction and information processing. The results highlight the importance of routine assessment in clinic settings for social competence and emotional/behavioural difficulties in BT survivors, to promote early identification and to ensure that survivors are referred for appropriate services and intervention as part of their multi-disciplinary care package.",2016,11,1,"Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer","10.1007/s00520-016-3301-4",NA,"Support Care Cancer","eng","D000293; D001932; D002648; D002675; D003430; D005260; D006801; D007223; D008297; D012917; D066107; D011795; D017741","Adolescent; Brain Neoplasms; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Social Adjustment; Social Skills; Surveys and Questionnaires; Survivors",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway University of London, Egham, Surrey, TW20 0EX, UK."

To test the effectiveness of prenatal docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on birth outcomes and infant development in a sample of African American women with Medicaid insurance and living in the city of Pittsburgh. The Nutrition and Pregnancy Study (NAPS) is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of prenatal DHA supplementation conducted between 2012 and 2014. Participants were recruited from obstetric clinics at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Sixty-four pregnant, African American women were enrolled at 16-21 weeks of gestation and randomized to either 450mg/day of DHA (22:6n-3)(n=43) or a soybean placebo (n=21). Four women (6.3%) withdrew from the study: two participants from each study arm; complete data were obtained for 49 infants (76.5%) at the 3-month assessment. Supplementation with DHA or placebo continued from the beginning of enrollment through delivery. Data on birth outcomes were collected from medical records. At approximately 3 months post-partum, mothers brought their infants to the laboratory where the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) were administered and cortisol response to the Face-to-Face Still-Face (FFSF) paradigm was assessed. Infants of mothers who received DHA supplementation had higher birth weight (3.174g versus 2.890g) than infants of mothers receiving placebo (F [2.40]=6.09, p=0.018, eta=0.36), and were more likely to have a 1-min Apgar score greater than 8 (OR=5.99 [95% CI=1.25-28.75], p=0.025). Infants of mothers who received DHA compared with infants of mothers receiving placebo had lower levels of cortisol in response to the FFSF paradigm (F [1.32]=5.36, p=0.018, eta=0.36). None of the scores on the BSID-III differed as a function of active supplement versus placebo. Infants of women living in urban, low-income environments who received DHA supplementation had more optimal birth outcomes and more modulated cortisol response to a stressor.

"27279648","Supplemental Security Income Benefits for Mental Disorders.","James M Perrin, Amy Houtrow, Kelly Kelleher, Kimberly Hoagwood, Ruth E K Stein, Bonnie Zima","The Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI) provides financial support to low-income households with children and youth with severe disabilities. The program included children when it began in the early 1970s. The numbers of children receiving SSI benefits increased substantially in the early 1990s, in part through an expansion of the listings of mental health conditions with which children could become eligible. Over the past 20 years, larger numbers of children have received SSI benefits for mental disorders, and these increases have led to questions from the press and Congress regarding these numbers. Do they indicate more of an increase in mental disorders among SSI children than in the general population? The National Academy of Medicine (NAM; formerly the Institute of Medicine) convened a study panel to examine what is known about mental disorders among the child SSI population and how that compares with evidence about mental disorders in children in general. The NAM report provides detailed information about how SSI works, about the changing numbers of children receiving SSI for mental disorders, and some comparisons with other evidence about rising rates of mental disorders in the general population and especially among children living in poverty. The report indicates that increasing numbers of children with mental disorders in SSI mirror similar increases in the population in general.

This study tested whether socio-economic status (SES) influences the relationship between obesity and antenatal depression. Data were taken from the Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE) cohort. BMI was calculated from measured height and weight at 15&#xb1;1 weeks' gestation. Underweight women were excluded. SES was indicated by self-reported household income (dichotomised around the median: low SES &#x2264;&#xa3;45,000; high SES &gt;&#xa3;45,000). Antenatal depression was defined as scoring &#x2265;13 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at both 15&#xb1;1 and 20&#xb1;1 weeks' gestation, to identify persistently elevated symptoms of depression. Five thousand five hundred and twenty two women were included in these analyses and 5.5% had persistently elevated antenatal depression symptoms. There was a significant interaction between SES and BMI on the risk of antenatal depression (p=0.042). Among high SES women, obese women had approximately double the odds of antenatal depression than normal weight controls (AOR 2.11, 95%CI 1.16-3.83, p=0.014, adjusted for confounders). Among low SES women there was no association between obesity and antenatal depression. The interaction effect was robust to alternative indicators of SES in sensitivity analyses. 1) Antenatal depression was assessed with a self-reported screening measure; and 2) potential mediators such as stigma and poor body-image could not be examined. Obesity was only associated with increased risk of antenatal depression among high SES women in this sample.

However, behavioral studies demonstrate that poor people with high self-esteem are often exempt from the deleterious effect of poverty and instead possess a happy and successful life. Here we investigated whether high self-esteem can buffer against the deleterious effects of poverty, as indicated by low subjective socioeconomic status (SSS), on the hippocampal gray matter volume (GMV) in a large cohort of young participants (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;280). As expected, findings revealed that although low (vs. high) SSS was linked with a smaller hippocampal GMV, the deleterious effect of low SSS on hippocampal GMV was alleviated when the participants have high self-esteem. Commonality analyses further confirmed this observation. The current study suggests that positive psychological resources such as self-esteem may provide protection for the hippocampal atrophy in adversity.

New psychological interventions delivered by non-specialists are needed to fill the treatment gap. This paper describes the process of developing a manual based task sharing counselling intervention for perinatal depression in Khayelitsha, Cape Town. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 participants, including service providers and service users at a clinic in Khayelitsha in order to explore the feasibility, acceptability and content of a task sharing counselling intervention. The interviews were recorded, translated and transcribed. Themes were identified using the framework analysis approach and were coded and analysed using NVivo v10. After the semi-structured interviews, a workshop was conducted with mental health experts on evidence-based psychological interventions for depression, together with a document review of counselling manuals for community health workers in South Africa. The findings indicate that a task sharing counselling intervention was acceptable and feasible for depressed women in Khayelitsha, under the following conditions: (1) respondents preferred a female counsellor and felt that clinic based individual sessions should be provided at least once a month by an experienced Xhosa speaking counsellor from the community; and (2) the content of a counselling intervention should include psycho-education on cognitive and behavioural effects of depression, how to cope with interpersonal problems, and financial stressors. Based on these conditions, the review of manuals and expert consultation, key components of the counselling intervention were identified as: psycho-education, problem solving, healthy thinking and behaviour activation. These were included in the final counselling manual. The development of task sharing counselling interventions for perinatal depression should be informed by the views and needs of local service users and service providers. The study illustrates the manner in which these views can be incorporated for the development of evidence-based psychological interventions, within a task sharing framework in low and middle-income countries.",2016,5,26,"BMC psychiatry","10.1186/s12888-016-0873-y","PMC4881204","BMC Psychiatry","eng","D000328; D003150; D003376; D003863; D019052; D005260; D006801; D011203; D011247; D011248; D013019","Adult; Community Health Workers; Counseling; Depression; Depression, Postpartum; Female; Humans; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; South Africa","U19 MH095699","10.1371/journal.pmed.0020291; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61689-4; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001442; 10.1177/1757913909343882; 10.1080/14767050701209560; 10.1001/archpsyc.61.9.946; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00549.x; 10.2471/BLT.11.091850; 10.1016/j.jad.2005.12.051; 10.1016/j.jad.2009.06.027; 10.1192/bjp.175.6.554; 10.1017/S0033291700001707; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.05.019; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60076-2; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.04.027; 10.1016/j.healthplace.2012.05.004; 10.1007/s00737-007-0193-9; 10.1007/s00127-008-0399-9; 10.1017/S0033291707001420; 10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2013.08.013; 10.2471/BLT.12.109819; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61238-0; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000160; 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12825-5; 10.1186/1472-6963-12-42; 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61400-2; 10.1093/heapol/czr012; 10.1001/jama.289.23.3117; 10.1186/1745-6215-15-457; 10.1080/03057070802037928; 10.1007/BF02687436; 10.1080/13552070500518186; 10.1001/jama.295.12.1376; 10.1016/j.cbpra.2006.11.004; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2005.00896.x; 10.1192/apt.bp.107.004051; 10.3109/09540261.2010.536153; 10.1080/14733140701566282; 10.1186/1748-5908-5-67",NA,"Alan J Flisher Centre for Public Mental Health, Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, University of Cape Town, 46 Sawkins Road, Rondebosch, Cape Town, South Africa."

The experiments in this study are focused on the demonstration of a method for determining amino acids from tear samples. Phenol red thread was used to absorptively collect tear fluid for qualitative and quantitative analyses of amino acids in basal, reflex, and emotional tears. The thread is also used as a support for sample preparation followed by elution with a buffer. The phenol red indicator on the thread turns from yellow to red with 15-s tear absorption and allows accurate volume measurement from 100&#xa0;nL to over 1&#xa0;&#x3bc;L. Derivatization of amino acids was performed directly on the thread with primary amine reactive fluorescamine for fluorescence detection. Analyte elution was performed via centrifugation with the thread in a pipet tip suspended in a centrifuge tube. Collected tear eluate was analyzed via capillary electrophoresis with LED-induced fluorescence. Glycine, glutamate, and aspartate were baseline resolved and used for method characterization. Recoveries were at 50&#xa0;% for a single derivation and elution step but average recoveries near 90&#xa0;% were found with two-step processing. Glutamate and aspartate are shown to be stable stored on thread for 3&#xa0;days. Basal, reflex, and emotional tears were analyzed from three subjects showing distinct amino acid profiles for each tear type. The demonstration of this method may facilitate the development of routine tear compositional analysis to assess ocular health.

"27222425","Association between salt and hypertension in rural and urban populations of low to middle income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis of population based studies.","Asvini K Subasinghe, Simin Arabshahi, Doreen Busingye, Roger G Evans, Karen Z Walker, Michaela A Riddell, Amanda G Thrift","The prevalence of hypertension, the greatest contributor to mortality globally, is increasing in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs). In urban regions of LMICs, excessive salt intake is associated with increased risk of hypertension. We aimed to determine whether this is the case in rural regions as well. We performed a meta-analysis of studies in rural and urban areas of LMICs in which the association of salt and hypertension were assessed using multivariable models. We identified 18 studies with a total of 134,916 participants. The prevalence of high salt intake ranged from 21.3% to 89.5% in rural and urban populations. When salt was analysed as a continuous variable, a greater impact of salt on hypertension was found in urban (n=4) (pooled effect size (ES) 1.42, 95% CI 1.19, 1.69) than in rural populations (n=4) (pooled ES 1.07, 95% CI 1.04, 1.10, p for difference &lt;0.001). In studies where salt was analysed continuously, a greater impact of salt on hypertension was observed in lean rural populations (BMI &lt;23 kg/m2) than in non-lean rural populations (BMI &gt;=23 kg/m2, p for difference &lt;0.001). The prevalence of high salt intake is similar in rural and urban regions. Excessive salt intake has a greater impact on the prevalence of hypertension in urban than rural regions. BMI appears to modify the relationship between salt and hypertension in rural populations. &#x80cc;&#x666f;&#x4e0e;&#x76ee;&#x7684;&#xff1a;&#x5728;&#x5168;&#x7403;&#x9ad8;&#x8840;&#x538b;&#x60a3;&#x75c5;&#x7387;&#x5bf9;&#x6b7b;&#x4ea1;&#x7387;&#x8d21;&#x732e;&#x6700;&#x5927;&#xff0c;&#x5728;&#x4f4e;&#x4e2d;&#x7b49;&#x6536;&#x5165;&#x56fd;&#x5bb6;&#x9ad8;&#x8840; &#x538b;&#x7684;&#x60a3;&#x75c5;&#x7387;&#x5448;&#x589e;&#x52a0;&#x7684;&#x8d8b;&#x52bf;&#x3002;&#x5728;&#x4f4e;&#x4e2d;&#x6536;&#x5165;&#x56fd;&#x5bb6;&#x7684;&#x57ce;&#x5e02;&#xff0c;&#x8fc7;&#x91cf;&#x7684;&#x76d0;&#x6444;&#x5165;&#x4e0e;&#x9ad8;&#x8840;&#x538b;&#x60a3; &#x75c5;&#x98ce;&#x9669;&#x7684;&#x589e;&#x52a0;&#x6709;&#x5173;&#xff0c;&#x6211;&#x4eec;&#x65e8;&#x5728;&#x7814;&#x7a76;&#x519c;&#x6751;&#x5730;&#x533a;&#x662f;&#x5426;&#x4ea6;&#x5982;&#x6b64;&#x3002;&#x65b9;&#x6cd5;&#x4e0e;&#x7814;&#x7a76;&#x8bbe;&#x8ba1;&#xff1a;&#x4f7f; &#x7528;&#x591a;&#x53d8;&#x91cf;&#x6a21;&#x578b;&#xff0c;&#x6211;&#x4eec;&#x8fdb;&#x884c;&#x4e86;&#x4f4e;&#x4e2d;&#x6536;&#x5165;&#x56fd;&#x5bb6;&#x76d0;&#x4e0e;&#x9ad8;&#x8840;&#x538b;&#x5173;&#x7cfb;&#x7684;meta &#x5206;&#x6790;&#x3002;&#x7ed3;&#x679c;&#xff1a; &#x5171;&#x5206;&#x6790;&#x4e86;&#x6765;&#x81ea;18 &#x4e2a;&#x7814;&#x7a76;&#x7684;134,916 &#x540d;&#x53c2;&#x4e0e;&#x8005;&#x3002;&#x519c;&#x6751;&#x548c;&#x57ce;&#x5e02;&#x5c45;&#x6c11;&#x9ad8;&#x76d0;&#x6444;&#x5165;&#x7684;&#x6bd4;&#x4f8b; &#x5728;21.3%&#x5230;89.5%&#x4e4b;&#x95f4;&#x3002;&#x5f53;&#x76d0;&#x6444;&#x5165;&#x91cf;&#x4f5c;&#x4e3a;&#x8fde;&#x7eed;&#x578b;&#x53d8;&#x91cf;&#x5206;&#x6790;&#x65f6;&#xff0c;&#x53d1;&#x73b0;&#x57ce;&#x5e02;&#x5730;&#x533a; &#xff08;n=4&#xff09;[&#x5408;&#x5e76;&#x6548;&#x5e94;&#x5c3a;&#x5ea6;&#xff08;ES&#xff09;&#x4e3a;1.42&#xff0c;95% CI &#x4e3a;1.19-1.69]&#x6bd4;&#x519c;&#x6751;&#x5730;&#x533a; &#xff08;n=4&#xff09;[&#x5408;&#x5e76;&#x6548;&#x5e94;&#x5c3a;&#x5ea6;&#xff08;ES&#xff09;&#x4e3a;1.07&#xff0c;95% CI &#x4e3a;1.04-1.10&#xff0c;p&lt;0.001]&#x3002;&#x5f53;&#x76d0;&#x6444; &#x5165;&#x91cf;&#x4f5c;&#x4e3a;&#x8fde;&#x7eed;&#x578b;&#x53d8;&#x91cf;&#x5206;&#x6790;&#x65f6;&#xff0c;&#x4f53;&#x578b;&#x504f;&#x7626;&#x7684;&#x519c;&#x6751;&#x4eba;&#x7fa4;&#xff08;BMI &lt;23 kg/m2&#xff09;&#x6bd4;&#x4f53;&#x578b;&#x4e0d; &#x504f;&#x7626;&#x7684;&#x519c;&#x6751;&#x4eba;&#x7fa4;&#xff08;BMI &gt;=23 kg/m2&#xff0c;p&lt;0.001&#xff09;&#x76d0;&#x6444;&#x5165;&#x5bf9;&#x9ad8;&#x8840;&#x538b;&#x60a3;&#x75c5;&#x7684;&#x5f71;&#x54cd;&#x66f4; &#x5927;&#x3002;&#x7ed3;&#x8bba;&#xff1a;&#x519c;&#x6751;&#x548c;&#x57ce;&#x5e02;&#x5730;&#x533a;&#x9ad8;&#x76d0;&#x6444;&#x5165;&#x7684;&#x6bd4;&#x4f8b;&#x76f8;&#x8fd1;&#x3002;&#x4e0e;&#x519c;&#x6751;&#x5c45;&#x6c11;&#x76f8;&#x6bd4;&#xff0c;&#x57ce;&#x5e02;&#x5c45;&#x6c11; &#x8fc7;&#x591a;&#x7684;&#x76d0;&#x6444;&#x5165;&#x5bf9;&#x9ad8;&#x8840;&#x538b;&#x60a3;&#x75c5;&#x7387;&#x7684;&#x5f71;&#x54cd;&#x66f4;&#x5927;&#x3002;&#x5728;&#x519c;&#x6751;&#x5c45;&#x6c11;&#x4e2d;&#xff0c;BMI &#x80fd;&#x8c03;&#x8282;&#x76d0;&#x6444;&#x5165; &#x548c;&#x9ad8;&#x8840;&#x538b;&#x7684;&#x5173;&#x7cfb;&#x3002;.",2016,1,1,"Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition","10.6133/apjcn.2016.25.2.25",NA,"Asia Pac J Clin Nutr","eng","D015984; D003906; D006801; D006973; D015994; D011203; D012307; D012424; D012959; D017673; D014505","Causality; Developing Countries; Humans; Hypertension; Incidence; Poverty; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Sodium Chloride, Dietary; Urban Population",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Sciences at Monash Health, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia."
"27217150","An epigenetic mechanism links socioeconomic status to changes in depression-related brain function in high-risk adolescents.","Johnna R Swartz, Ahmad R Hariri, Douglas E Williamson","Identifying biological mechanisms through which the experience of adversity emerges as individual risk for mental illness is an important step toward developing strategies for personalized treatment and, ultimately, prevention. Preclinical studies have identified epigenetic modification of gene expression as one such mechanism. Recent clinical studies have suggested that epigenetic modification, particularly methylation of gene regulatory regions, also acts to shape human brain function associated with risk for mental illness. However, it is not yet clear whether differential gene methylation as a function of adversity contributes to the emergence of individual risk for mental illness. Using prospective longitudinal epigenetic, neuroimaging and behavioral data from 132 adolescents, we demonstrate that changes in gene methylation associated with lower socioeconomic status (SES) predict changes in risk-related brain function. Specifically, we find that lower SES during adolescence is associated with an increase in methylation of the proximal promoter of the serotonin transporter gene, which predicts greater increases in threat-related amygdala reactivity. We subsequently demonstrate that greater increases in amygdala reactivity moderate the association between a positive family history for depression and the later manifestation of depressive symptoms. These initial results suggest a specific biological mechanism through which adversity contributes to altered brain function, which in turn moderates the emergence of general liability as individual risk for mental illness. If replicated, this prospective pathway may represent a novel target biomarker for intervention and prevention among high-risk individuals.",2017,2,1,"Molecular psychiatry","10.1038/mp.2016.82","PMC5122474","Mol Psychiatry","eng","D000293; D000679; D002648; D019175; D003863; D003866; D044127; D057890; D005260; D006801; D008137; D008297; D011401; D011446; D012307; D050486; D012923; D055815","Adolescent; Amygdala; Child; DNA Methylation; Depression; Depressive Disorder; Epigenesis, Genetic; Epigenomics; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; Social Class; Young Adult","R01 AG049789; R01 DA033369; R01 DA031579; P30 DA023026; R01 AA016274; R01 MH087493","NA",NA,"Division of Translational Neuroscience, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708 USA."

Universal newborn hearing screening identifies the majority of the 1 in 1000 children born with a hearing impairment, but later onset can occur at any time and there is no optimum time for further screening. A universal but non-standardised school entry screening (SES) programme is in place in many parts of the UK but its value is questioned. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of hearing screening tests and the cost-effectiveness of the SES programme in the UK. Systematic review, case-control diagnostic accuracy study, comparison of routinely collected data for services with and without a SES programme, parental questionnaires, observation of practical implementation and cost-effectiveness modelling. Second- and third-tier audiology services; community. Children aged 4-6 years and their parents. Diagnostic accuracy of two hearing screening devices, referral rate and source, yield, age at referral and cost per quality-adjusted life-year. The review of diagnostic accuracy studies concluded that research to date demonstrates marked variability in the design, methodological quality and results. The pure-tone screen (PTS) (Amplivox, Eynsham, UK) and HearCheck (HC) screener (Siemens, Frimley, UK) devices had high sensitivity (PTS &#x2265;&#x2009;89%, HC &#x2265;&#x2009;83%) and specificity (PTS &#x2265;&#x2009;78%, HC &#x2265;&#x2009;83%) for identifying hearing impairment. The rate of referral for hearing problems was 36% lower with SES (Nottingham) relative to no SES (Cambridge) [rate ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.69; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001]. The yield of confirmed cases did not differ between areas with and without SES (rate ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.06; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.12). The mean age of referral did not differ between areas with and without SES for all referrals but children with confirmed hearing impairment were older at referral in the site with SES (mean age difference 0.47 years, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.70 years; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Parental responses revealed that the consequences to the family of the referral process are minor. A SES programme is unlikely to be cost-effective and, using base-case assumptions, is dominated by a no screening strategy. A SES programme could be cost-effective if there are fewer referrals associated with SES programmes or if referrals occur more quickly with SES programmes. A SES programme using the PTS or HC screener is unlikely to be effective in increasing the identified number of cases with hearing impairment and lowering the average age at identification and is therefore unlikely to represent good value for money. This finding is, however, critically dependent on the results of the observational study comparing Nottingham and Cambridge, which has limitations. The following are suggested: systematic reviews of the accuracy of devices used to measure hearing at school entry; characterisation and measurement of the cost-effectiveness of different approaches to the ad-hoc referral system; examination of programme specificity as opposed to test specificity; further observational comparative studies of different programmes; and opportunistic trials of withdrawal of SES programmes.

"27166666","A Human-machine-interface Integrating Low-cost Sensors with a Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation System for Post-stroke Balance Rehabilitation.","Deepesh Kumar, Abhijit Das, Uttama Lahiri, Anirban Dutta","A stroke is caused when an artery carrying blood from heart to an area in the brain bursts or a clot obstructs the blood flow to brain thereby preventing delivery of oxygen and nutrients. About half of the stroke survivors are left with some degree of disability. Innovative methodologies for restorative neurorehabilitation are urgently required to reduce long-term disability. The ability of the nervous system to reorganize its structure, function and connections as a response to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli is called neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is involved in post-stroke functional disturbances, but also in rehabilitation. Beneficial neuroplastic changes may be facilitated with non-invasive electrotherapy, such as neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) and sensory electrical stimulation (SES). NMES involves coordinated electrical stimulation of motor nerves and muscles to activate them with continuous short pulses of electrical current while SES involves stimulation of sensory nerves with electrical current resulting in sensations that vary from barely perceivable to highly unpleasant. Here, active cortical participation in rehabilitation procedures may be facilitated by driving the non-invasive electrotherapy with biosignals (electromyogram (EMG), electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG)) that represent simultaneous active perception and volitional effort. To achieve this in a resource-poor setting, e.g., in low- and middle-income countries, we present a low-cost human-machine-interface (HMI) by leveraging recent advances in off-the-shelf video game sensor technology. In this paper, we discuss the open-source software interface that integrates low-cost off-the-shelf sensors for visual-auditory biofeedback with non-invasive electrotherapy to assist postural control during balance rehabilitation. We demonstrate the proof-of-concept on healthy volunteers.",2016,4,12,"Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","10.3791/52394","PMC4941915","J Vis Exp","eng","D004558; D004599; D004576; D006801; D020521; D000071939","Electric Stimulation; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Electromyography; Humans; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation",NA,"NA",NA,"Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique (INRIA); Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors (IfADo);"
"27161428","Critical considerations about the use of poverty measures in the study of cognitive development.","Sebasti&#xe1;n J Lipina","Developmental psychology and developmental cognitive neuroscience generated evidence at different levels of analysis about the influences of poverty on neurocognitive development (i.e., molecular, neural activation, cognition, behaviour). In addition, different individual and environmental factors were identified as mediators of such influences. Such a complexity is also illustrated through the many poverty conceptual and operational definitions generated by social, human and health sciences. However, to establish the causal relationships between the different factors of poverty and neurocognitive outcomes is still an issue under construction. Most studies of this area apply classic unidimensional poverty indicators such as income and maternal education. Nonetheless, this approach does not take into adequate consideration the variability of neurocognitive outcomes depending on the type of poverty measures, and the dynamic nature of changes during development. This creates a virtual underestimation of the complexity imposed by the involved mediating mechanisms. The scientific and policy implications of this underestimation include the risk of not adequately addressing children rights and developmental opportunities. This article proposes to explore such scenario, which is necessary for the reconsideration of the criteria used to analyse the influences of poverty on child development in general and neurocognitive development in particular.",2017,6,1,"International journal of psychology : Journal international de psychologie","10.1002/ijop.12282",NA,"Int J Psychol","eng","D002648; D002657; D003071; D006801; D011203; D012307","Child; Child Development; Cognition; Humans; Poverty; Risk Factors",NA,"NA",NA,"Unidad de Neurobiolog&#xed;a Aplicada (UNA, CEMIC-CONICET), Buenos Aires, Argentina."

Findings From a UK Longitudinal Cohort Study.","Joanne Newbury, Louise Arseneault, Avshalom Caspi, Terrie E Moffitt, Candice L Odgers, Helen L Fisher","Urban upbringing is associated with a 2-fold adulthood psychosis risk, and this association replicates for childhood psychotic symptoms. No study has investigated whether specific features of urban neighborhoods increase children's risk for psychotic symptoms, despite these early psychotic phenomena elevating risk for schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders in adulthood. Analyses were conducted on over 2000 children from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally-representative cohort of UK-born twins. Neighborhood-level characteristics were assessed for each family via: a geodemographic discriminator indexing neighborhood-level deprivation, postal surveys of over 5000 residents living alongside the children, and in-home interviews with the children's mothers. Children were interviewed about psychotic symptoms at age 12. Analyses were adjusted for important family-level confounders including socioeconomic status (SES), psychiatric history, and maternal psychosis. Urban residency at age-5 (OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.16-2.77) and age-12 (OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.15-2.69) were both significantly associated with childhood psychotic symptoms, but not with age-12 anxiety, depression, or antisocial behavior. The association was not attributable to family SES, family psychiatric history, or maternal psychosis, each implicated in childhood mental health. Low social cohesion, together with crime victimization in the neighborhood explained nearly a quarter of the association between urbanicity and childhood psychotic symptoms after considering family-level confounders. Low social cohesion and crime victimization in the neighborhood partly explain why children in cities have an elevated risk of developing psychotic symptoms. Greater understanding of the mechanisms leading from neighborhood-level exposures to psychotic symptoms could help target interventions for emerging childhood psychotic symptoms.",2016,11,1,"Schizophrenia bulletin",NA,"PMC5049530","Schizophr Bull","eng","D001007; D002648; D002675; D003415; D019548; D003863; D005190; D005260; D005500; D006801; D007604; D008137; D008297; D009035; D011618; D012111; D012307; D012923; D006113; D014505","Anxiety; Child; Child, Preschool; Crime; Crime Victims; Depression; Family; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Juvenile Delinquency; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mothers; Psychotic Disorders; Residence Characteristics; Risk Factors; Social Class; United Kingdom; Urban Population","G1002190; R01 HD077482; P30 AG034424; R01 HD061298; G9806489","NA",NA,"MRC Social, Genetic &amp; Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK;"

The purpose of this study was to examine the stigma experiences, explanatory models, unmet needs, preferred interventions and coping mechanisms of caregivers of children with developmental disorders in Ethiopia. Participants comprised caregivers (n = 102) of children with developmental disorders attending two child mental health clinics in Addis Ababa. The majority (66.7%; n = 68) had a diagnosis of intellectual disability (ID); 34 children (33.3%) had autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as their primary diagnosis. All caregivers were administered a structured questionnaire via a face-to-face interview, which included an adaptation of the Family Interview Schedule, closed questions about socio-demographic characteristics, explanatory models of illness, type of interventions used or desired and coping strategies, and an open ended question regarding the family's unmet needs. Most caregivers reported experience of stigma: 43.1% worried about being treated differently, 45.1% felt ashamed about their child's condition and 26.7% made an effort to keep their child's condition secret. Stigma did not depend on the type of developmental disorder, the child's age or gender, or on the age or level of education of the caregiver (all p &gt; 0.05). Reported stigma was significantly higher in caregivers who had sought traditional help (p &lt; 0.01), provided supernatural explanations for their child's condition (p =&#x2009;.02) and in caregivers of Orthodox Christian faith (p =&#x2009;.03). Caregivers gave a mixture of biomedical explanations (e.g. head injury (30.4%) or birth complications (25.5%)) and supernatural explanations (e.g. spirit possession (40.2%) or sinful act (27.5%)) for their child's condition. The biggest reported unmet need was educational provision for their child (74.5%), followed by treatment by a health professional (47.1%), financial support (30.4%) and expert help to support their child's development (27.5%). Most caregivers reported that talking to health professionals (86.3%) and family (85.3%) helped them to cope.

Mean priority scores were calculated per indicator (score range, 1-5). All 52 indicators had a weighted mean score that ranged from 3.20 for the lowest ranked to 4.27 for the highest ranked. The 15 highest ranked indicators cover the different domains of measuring effective mental health treatment coverage. This set of indicators is highly stable between the different groups of experts, as well as between the different participating countries.

The evaluation was designed to assess the impact of program on the contact coverage of evidence-based treatments for depression and AUD through a repeated survey design. This paper describes the baseline prevalence of depression among adults in rural community, association of various demographic and socio-economic factors with depression and estimates contact coverage and costs of care for depression. Population-based cross-sectional survey of adults in 30 villages of Amravati district in Vidarbha region of Central India. The outcome of interest was a probable diagnosis of depression which was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Data were analyzed using simple and multiple logistic regression. The outcome of current depression (PHQ-9&#xa0;&#x2265;&#xa0;10) was observed in 14.6&#xa0;% of the sample (95&#xa0;% CI 12.8-16.4&#xa0;%).

To test the effectiveness of adding a narrative leaflet to the current information material delivered by the NHS English colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programme on reducing socioeconomic inequalities in uptake. Participants. 150,417 adults (59-74 years) routinely invited to complete the guaiac Faecal Occult Blood test (gFOBt) in March 2013. Design. A cluster randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN74121020) to compare uptake between two arms. The control arm received the standard NHS CRC screening information material (SI) and the intervention arm received the standard information plus a supplementary narrative leaflet, which had previously been shown to increase screening intentions (SI + N). Between group comparisons were made for uptake overall and across socioeconomic status (SES). Results. Uptake was 57.7% and did not differ significantly between the two trial arms (SI: 58.5%; SI + N: 56.7%; odds ratio = 0.93; 95% confidence interval: 0.81-1.06; p = 0.27). There was no interaction between group and SES quintile (p = 0.44). Conclusions. Adding a narrative leaflet to existing information materials does not reduce the SES gradient in uptake.

We report on the impact of low socioeconomic position (SEP) on mortality over a 5-year observation period among community-dwelling older adults living in southwestern Nigeria. Data are from a household multistage probability sample of 2,149 Yoruba Nigerians aged 65 years or older. We collected information on indices related to health and well-being at baseline (2003/2004). Socioeconomic positions were estimated using asset-based measures relevant to low income settings. Information on mortality was obtained by research supervisors in multiple waves (2007, 2008, and 2009). Associations between baseline covariates and mortality were explored using discrete time survival models and life tables. We recorded 357 deaths over 5 years, or an annual mortality rate of 4.7% (95% CI = 4.2-5.2). Being 80 years or older (HR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1-2.5) and belonging to the lowest SEP (HR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1-2.1) were the main predictors of mortality. The significant effect of lowest SEP on mortality risk over the study period was independent of age, gender, education, rural or urban residence, weight, physical activity level, and social engagement.

Because the effects of SES can outlast the period of stimulation, we examined the possibility that SES can also enhance the retention of motor performance, motor memory consolidation, after 24 h (Day 2) and 7 days (Day 7), that such effects would be scaled by SES duration, and that such effects were mediated by changes in aspects of corticospinal excitability, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF). Healthy young adults (n = 40) received either 20 (SES-20), 40 (SES-40), or 60 min (SES-60) of real SES, or sham SES (SES-0). The results showed SES-20 increased visuomotor performance on Day 2 (15%) and Day 7 (17%) and SES-60 increased visuomotor performance on Day 7 (11%; all p &lt; 0.05) compared with SES-0. Specific responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) increased immediately after SES (p &lt; 0.05) but not on Days 2 and 7. In addition, changes in behavioral and neurophysiological parameters did not correlate, suggesting that paths and structures other than the ones TMS can assay must be (also) involved in the increases in visuomotor performance after SES. As examined in the present study, low-intensity peripheral electrical nerve stimulation did not have acute effects on healthy adults' visuomotor performance but SES had delayed effects in the form of enhanced motor memory consolidation that were not scaled by the duration of SES.",2016,1,1,"Frontiers in human neuroscience","10.3389/fnhum.2016.00115","PMC4792880","Front Hum Neurosci","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1038/81453; 10.1186/1743-0003-10-51; 10.1093/brain/112.1.147; 10.1016/j.cub.2004.01.033; 10.1007/s11357-015-9779-8; 10.1016/j.brs.2015.01.405; 10.1007/s00221-011-2863-0; 10.1371/journal.pone.0006683; 10.1073/pnas.97.7.3661; 10.1016/0165-1781(89)90047-4; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1399-13.2013; 10.1002/cne.902870403; 10.1016/j.apmr.2007.08.001; 10.1016/j.clinph.2010.07.025; 10.1007/s002210050005; 10.1007/s00415-006-0364-z; 10.1002/ana.10070; 10.1016/j.neuron.2011.10.008; 10.1007/PL00005641; 10.1002/hbm.22306; 10.1152/jn.00346.2005; 10.1007/s00221-008-1620-5; 10.1007/PL00005612; 10.1006/nimg.2002.1195; 10.1212/WNL.62.12.2262; 10.1016/S0959-4388(02)00307-0; 10.1113/jphysiol.2001.012801; 10.1007/s00221-002-1094-9; 10.1113/jphysiol.1997.sp022015; 10.1007/s00221-003-1628-9; 10.1007/s00221-002-1329-9; 10.1007/s00415-008-0990-8; 10.1136/jnnp.2008.161117; 10.1113/jphysiol.1993.sp019912; 10.1016/j.neuron.2015.05.006; 10.1002/jnr.20733; 10.1097/00001756-200207190-00011; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5965-08.2009; 10.1038/nature712; 10.1152/japplphysiol.01073.2003; 10.1016/0028-3932(71)90067-4; 10.1016/j.brs.2015.04.001; 10.1016/0168-5597(92)90097-U; 10.3389/fncom.2013.00111; 10.1016/S1474-4422(13)70213-8; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1319-11.2011; 10.1016/j.specom.2004.02.004; 10.1016/S1388-2457(01)00592-2; 10.1038/nrn1426; 10.1016/j.clinph.2009.08.016; 10.1007/s00221-007-0960-x; 10.1161/01.STR.0000195130.16843.ac; 10.1371/journal.pone.0051298; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.09.014; 10.1097/JES.0b013e3181c5cce7; 10.1152/jn.01187.2007; 10.1126/science.277.5327.821; 10.1002/pri.515; 10.1111/j.1532-5415.1992.tb01992.x; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.07.013; 10.1007/s00421-015-3248-z; 10.1016/j.apmr.2005.11.019; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.05.055; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.01.026; 10.1002/ana.23761",NA,"Center for Human Movement Sciences, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen Groningen, Netherlands."

We validated three screening tools: the Shona Symptom Questionnaire for common mental disorders (SSQ-14), the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression (PHQ-9), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7). The study participants were attendees at a primary health care clinic in Harare, Zimbabwe. Consecutive adults aged 18 and above attending the clinic were enrolled over a two-week period in September 2013. Trained research assistants administered the screening tools to eligible participants after obtaining written consent. Participants were then interviewed by one of four psychiatrists using the Structured Clinical Interview of the DSM-IV (SCID). Performance characteristics were calculated for each tool, against the SCID as the gold standard. A total of 264 participants were enrolled, of whom 52 (20%) met the SCID criteria for depression alone, 97 (37%) for mixed depression and anxiety and 9 (3%) for anxiety alone. Of the 237 where HIV status was known, 165 (70%) were HIV positive. With the optimal cutoff of &#x2265;9, the sensitivity and specificity for the SSQ-14 against a diagnosis of either depression and/or general anxiety were 84% (95%CI:78-89%) and 73% (95%CI:63-81%) respectively. Internal reliability was high (Cronbach &#x3b1;=0.74). The optimal cutoff for PHQ-9 was &#x2265;11, which provided a sensitivity of 85% (95%CI:78-90%) and specificity of 69% (95%CI:59-77%) against a SCID diagnosis of depression (Cronbach &#x3b1;=0.86). The GAD-7 (optimal cutoff &#x2265;10) had sensitivity and specificity of 89% (95%CI:81-94%) and 73% (95%CI:65-80%) respectively against a SCID diagnosis of GAD (Cronbach &#x3b1;=0.87).

"27010550","Psychological Symptoms and Social Functioning Following Repair of Obstetric Fistula in a Low-Income Setting.","Sarah M Wilson, Kathleen J Sikkema, Melissa H Watt, Gileard G Masenga, Mary V Mosha","Objectives Obstetric fistula is a maternal injury that causes uncontrollable leaking of urine or stool, and most women who develop it live in poverty in low-income countries. Obstetric fistula is associated with high rates of stigma and psychological morbidity, but there is uncertainty about the impact of surgical treatment on psychological outcomes. The objective of this exploratory study was to examine changes in psychological symptoms following surgical fistula repair, discharge and reintegration home. Methods Women admitted for surgical repair of obstetric fistula were recruited from a Tanzanian hospital serving a rural catchment area. Psychological symptoms and social functioning were assessed prior to surgery. Approximately 3&#xa0;months after discharge, a data collector visited the patients' homes to repeat psychosocial measures and assess self-reported incontinence. Baseline to follow-up differences were measured with paired t tests controlling for multiple comparisons. Associations between psychological outcomes and leaking were assessed with t tests and Pearson correlations. Results Participants (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;28) had been living with fistula for an average of 11&#xa0;years. Baseline psychological distress was high, and decreased significantly at follow-up. Participants who self-reported continued incontinence at follow-up endorsed significantly higher PTSD and depression symptoms than those who reported being cured, and severity of leaking was associated with psychological distress. Conclusions Fistula patients experience improvements in mental health at 3&#xa0;months after discharge, but these improvements are curtailed when women experience residual leaking. Given the rate of stress incontinence following surgery, it is important to prepare fistula patients for the possibility of incomplete cure and help them develop appropriate coping strategies.",2016,5,1,"Maternal and child health journal","10.1007/s10995-016-1950-z","PMC4826832","Matern Child Health J","eng","D000223; D000328; D003863; D005260; D005402; D006801; D008603; D007744; D011203; D011247; D011788; D012918; D057545; D013636","Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Depression; Female; Fistula; Humans; Mental Health; Obstetric Labor Complications; Poverty; Pregnancy; Quality of Life; Social Alienation; Social Stigma; Tanzania","R21 HD073681; R21-HD073681","10.2471/blt.13.117564; 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2012.03294.x; 10.1080/17441692.2014.903988; 10.1007/s12529-015-9466-2; 10.1258/td.2011.110423; 10.1016/S0020-7292(03)00222-4; 10.1111/tmi.12086; 10.1080/17441692.2010.551519; 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2007.01419.x; 10.1177/014662167700100306; 10.1207/s15327558ijbm0401_6; 10.1192/bjp.158.3.379; 10.1080/09540120701245999","<b>Compliance with Ethical Standards: Conflict of interest</b> The authors have no conflicts of interest to report.","Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre, Moshi, Tanzania."

The main objective of this study is to investigate the association between risk-behaviors and PIU in European adolescents. This cross-sectional study was conducted within the framework of the FP7 European Union project: Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE). Data on adolescents were collected from randomized schools within study sites across eleven European countries. PIU was measured using Young's Diagnostic Questionnaire (YDQ). Risk-behaviors were assessed using questions procured from the Global School-Based Student Health Survey (GSHS). A total of 11,931 adolescents were included in the analyses: 43.4% male and 56.6% female (M/F: 5179/6752), with a mean age of 14.89 &#xb1; 0.87 years. Adolescents reporting poor sleeping habits and risk-taking actions showed the strongest associations with PIU, followed by tobacco use, poor nutrition and physical inactivity. Among adolescents in the PIU group, 89.9% were characterized as having multiple risk-behaviors. The significant association observed between PIU and risk-behaviors, combined with a high rate of co-occurrence, underlines the importance of considering PIU when screening, treating or preventing high-risk behaviors among adolescents.",2016,3,8,"International journal of environmental research and public health","10.3390/ijerph13030294","PMC4808957","Int J Environ Res Public Health","eng","D000293; D000294; D016739; D003430; D005060; D005260; D006801; D020407; D008297; D012309; D013334; D011795","Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Behavior, Addictive; Cross-Sectional Studies; Europe; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Risk-Taking; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires",NA,"10.1093/scan/nsl024; 10.1016/S0193-3973(00)00063-0; 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x; 10.1016/j.appdev.2008.07.002; 10.1037/0003-066X.53.9.1017; 10.1111/1540-4560.00248; 10.1089/109493103322725441; 10.1111/nhs.12192; 10.1515/ijamh-2013-0508; 10.1016/j.adolescence.2006.07.004; 10.1080/00140130903067789; 10.2165/00023210-200822050-00001; 10.1089/cpb.1998.1.237; 10.1111/add.12162; 10.1177/0163278710380124; 10.1089/cyber.2012.0063; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2014.02.016; 10.1016/j.chc.2010.03.012; 10.1038/nrn3119; 10.1097/ADM.0b013e31825ba7e7; 10.1186/1471-2458-11-595; 10.1016/j.ejrad.2009.10.025; 10.1080/14659890500114359; 10.1089/cyber.2014.0317; 10.1007/s00038-014-0635-x; 10.1089/cyber.2013.0382; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2012.03946.x; 10.2174/13816128113199990617; 10.1159/000337971; 10.1186/1471-244X-14-183; 10.1007/s00787-014-0562-7; 10.1093/pubmed/fdr122; 10.1016/j.ypmed.2010.04.005; 10.1111/acps.12124; 10.1016/j.ypmed.2008.02.001; 10.1002/wps.20088; 10.1186/1471-2458-10-192; 10.1186/1471-2458-13-479; 10.1089/cpb.2008.0162; 10.1371/journal.pone.0145981; 10.1371/journal.pone.0110137; 10.1111/j.1440-1819.2009.01925.x; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2007.05.004; 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2003.tb03008.x; 10.1016/j.chb.2008.11.001; 10.1016/j.chb.2005.07.002; 10.3390/ijerph8093528; 10.4103/0972-6748.119589; 10.1371/journal.pone.0117372; 10.1007/s11920-014-0444-1; 10.1016/j.sleep.2010.02.006; 10.1159/000345403; 10.1016/S0747-5632(01)00056-5; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1987.tb01490.x; 10.1007/s11469-014-9500-7; 10.1007/s11469-013-9459-9",NA,"National Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention of Mental Ill-Health (NASP), Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm SE-17177, Sweden."

In a separate line of research, family socioeconomic status (SES) has been strongly associated with children's early cognitive development, with socioeconomic disparities emerging during the second year of life for both language and declarative memory skills. The present study examined associations among resting EEG power at birth, SES, and language and memory skills at 15-months in a sample of full-term infants. Results indicate no associations between SES and EEG power at birth. However, EEG power at birth was related to both language and memory outcomes at 15-months. Specifically, frontal power (24-48Hz) was positively correlated with later Visual Paired Comparison (VPC) memory scores. Power (24-35Hz) in the parietal region was positively correlated with later PLS-Auditory Comprehension language scores. These findings suggest that SES disparities in brain activity may not be apparent at birth, but measures of resting neonatal EEG power are correlated with later memory and language skills independently of SES.",2016,6,1,"Developmental cognitive neuroscience","10.1016/j.dcn.2016.03.004","PMC4912880","Dev Cogn Neurosci","eng","D000161; D002648; D002657; D003071; D004569; D005260; D006801; D007223; D007802; D007804; D008137; D008297; D008568; D012146; D012923","Acoustic Stimulation; Child; Child Development; Cognition; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Infant; Language; Language Development; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Memory; Rest; Social Class","R37 HD032774; U01 HD045935; U01 HD055155; UL1 TR000040","NA",NA,"Department of Biobehavioral Sciences, Teachers College Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."

Previous literature has focused exclusively on pregnancy and the early postpartum, but parenting is an evolving process, necessitating adaption to changing circumstances. We extended previous literature and investigate the changes in the postpartum from 3 to 18 months that occur in maternal attitudes. Using the Childbearing Attitudes Questionnaire, we collected data on mothers' ratings of maternal worries, self-efficacy, mother-infant bonding, relationship with the partner and interest in sex (n = 171 women). Data were analysed with a latent growth curve. Results demonstrated stability in all maternal attitudes after 3 months postpartum. Further, different maternal attitudes are affected by different variables. Maternal worries and self-efficacy are associated with parity, postpartum depression and child temperament. Interestingly, a negative evaluation of the relationship with the partner was only associated with breastfeeding status, while interest in sex was associated with parity, socio-economic status (SES) and depressive symptoms. Despite general stability, different maternal attitudes related to different sets of variables. These patterns of attitudes in relation to relevant variables are discussed in terms of the literature on self-efficacy and gender roles, with important implications for clinical interventions.",2016,7,1,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)","10.1111/apa.13409",NA,"Acta Paediatr","eng","D000328; D005260; D006801; D009035; D009769; D011247; D020377; D012725","Adult; Female; Humans; Mothers; Object Attachment; Pregnancy; Self Efficacy; Sexual Behavior",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Psychology, University of Toronto Mississauga, Toronto, ON, Canada."

The review focuses on assessment approaches and information sources. A systematic review of empirical studies published in PubMed, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, LILACS, and SciELO databases between 2007 and 2015. Search terms were chosen that relate preterm birth to QoL. Twenty-two articles were included. Of these, ten investigated QoL in children, six investigated adolescents, and six investigated adults. All studies used generic instruments to assess QoL. There was a high rate of parental report to assess QoL in studies of children. Adolescent and adult studies most often assessed QoL through self-report. Parents of children who were born preterm reported worse QoL for their children compared with parents of children born full term. Teenagers and adults who were born preterm self-reported more positive outcomes in their QoL. The main risk factors associated with worse QoL in children who were born preterm were congenital malformations, mechanical ventilation during the neonatal phase, cognitive impairments, behavioral problems, physical disabilities, low family income, and black race. Agreement between parents and children about QoL in preterm individuals was lower in younger age groups compared with older age groups. The differences in QoL throughout the different age groups may have arisen because of developmental changes or differences in the source of information used (i.e., parent report or self-report). We recommend that QoL assessments in children born preterm should consider both parent report and self-report.",2016,9,1,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation","10.1007/s11136-016-1259-9",NA,"Qual Life Res","eng","D000293; D000328; D044383; D002648; D003072; D000013; D005260; D006801; D007231; D007234; D001523; D011203; D011788; D012121; D012307; D057566; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Black People; Child; Cognition Disorders; Congenital Abnormalities; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Mental Disorders; Poverty; Quality of Life; Respiration, Artificial; Risk Factors; Self Report; Young Adult",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Neurosciences and Behavior, Ribeir&#xe3;o Preto Medical School, University of S&#xe3;o Paulo, Avenida Tenente Cat&#xe3;o Roxo, 2650, Pr&#xe9;dio da Sa&#xfa;de Mental, Campus Universit&#xe1;rio Monte Alegre, Ribeir&#xe3;o Preto, SP, CEP 14051-140, Brazil."

We aimed to assess the accuracy of a meal recall questionnaire, adapted for use with impoverished South Indian populations living in rural areas. Dietary data collected by recall versus weighed meals were compared. Data were obtained from 45 adults aged 19-85 years, living in rural Andhra Pradesh, who were recruited by convenience sampling. Weighed meal records (WMRs) were conducted in the household by a researcher aided by a trained field worker. The following day, field workers conducted a recall interview with the same participant. Eight life size photographs of portions of South Indian foods were created to aid each participant's recall and a database of nutrients was developed to calculate nutrient intake. Pearson correlations were used to assess the strength of associations between intake of energy and nutrients calculated from meal recalls versus WMRs. Least products regression was conducted to examine fixed and proportional bias. Bland-Altman plots were constructed to measure systematic or differential bias. Significant correlations were observed between estimates for energy and nutrients obtained by the two methods (r2=0.19-0.67, p&lt;0.001). No systematic bias was detected by Bland-Altman plots. Recall method underestimated the intake of protein and fat in a manner proportional to the level of intake. Our culturally adapted meal recall questionnaire provides an accurate measure for assessment of the intake of energy, macronutrients and some micronutrients in rural Indian populations. &#x80cc;&#x666f;&#x8207;&#x76ee;&#x7684;&#xff1a;&#x6587;&#x5316;&#x8207;/&#x6216;&#x74b0;&#x5883;&#x969c;&#x7919;&#x662f;&#x8a55;&#x4f30;&#x8fb2;&#x6751;&#x4eba;&#x53e3;&#x98f2;&#x98df;&#x651d;&#x53d6;&#x7684;&#x6311;&#x6230;&#x3002;&#x6211;&#x5011;&#x7684;&#x76ee;&#x5730; &#x70ba;&#x8a55;&#x4f30;&#x4e00;&#x4efd;&#x9069;&#x7528;&#x65bc;&#x5c45;&#x4f4f;&#x5728;&#x8ca7;&#x56f0;&#x7684;&#x5357;&#x5370;&#x5ea6;&#x8fb2;&#x6751;&#x4eba;&#x53e3;&#x7684;&#x9910;&#x98df;&#x56de;&#x61b6;&#x554f;&#x5377;&#x7684;&#x6b63;&#x78ba;&#x6027;&#x3002;&#x65b9; &#x6cd5;&#x8207;&#x7814;&#x7a76;&#x8a2d;&#x8a08;&#xff1a;&#x98f2;&#x98df;&#x8cc7;&#x6599;&#x4ee5;&#x56de;&#x61b6;&#x6cd5;&#x53ca;&#x81b3;&#x98df;&#x79e4;&#x91cd;&#x6cd5;&#x6536;&#x96c6;&#x4e26;&#x6bd4;&#x8f03;&#x3002;&#x8cc7;&#x6599;&#x4f86;&#x81ea;&#x65bc;19- 85 &#x6b72;&#x5c45;&#x4f4f;&#x5728;Andhra Pradesh &#x8fb2;&#x6751;&#x7684;45 &#x540d;&#x4fbf;&#x5229;&#x53d6;&#x6a23;&#x7684;&#x6210;&#x4eba;&#x3002;&#x7531;&#x4e00;&#x540d;&#x7814;&#x7a76;&#x8005;&#x52a0;&#x4e0a; &#x53d7;&#x904e;&#x8a13;&#x7684;&#x7530;&#x91ce;&#x5de5;&#x4f5c;&#x8005;&#x7684;&#x5354;&#x52a9;&#xff0c;&#x5728;&#x5bb6;&#x6236;&#x4e2d;&#x9032;&#x884c;&#x81b3;&#x98df;&#x79e4;&#x91cd;&#x7d00;&#x9304;&#xff08;WMRs&#xff09;&#x3002;&#x7fcc;&#x65e5;&#xff0c; &#x7530;&#x91ce;&#x5de5;&#x4f5c;&#x8005;&#x6703;&#x9032;&#x884c;&#x540c;&#x4e00;&#x4f4d;&#x53c3;&#x8207;&#x8005;&#x7684;&#x56de;&#x61b6;&#x8a2a;&#x8996;&#x3002;&#x6709;&#x516b;&#x500b;&#x5be6;&#x969b;&#x5c3a;&#x5bf8;&#x7684;&#x5357;&#x5370;&#x5ea6;&#x98df;&#x7269;&#x4efd; &#x91cf;&#x5716;&#x7247;&#x88ab;&#x7528;&#x4ee5;&#x8f14;&#x52a9;&#x53c3;&#x8207;&#x8005;&#x56de;&#x61b6;&#xff0c;&#x4e00;&#x500b;&#x71df;&#x990a;&#x7d20;&#x8cc7;&#x6599;&#x5eab;&#x7528;&#x4ee5;&#x8a08;&#x7b97;&#x71df;&#x990a;&#x7d20;&#x651d;&#x53d6;&#x91cf;&#x88ab;&#x767c; &#x5c55;&#x3002;&#x4ee5;&#x76ae;&#x723e;&#x68ee;&#x76f8;&#x95dc;&#x8a55;&#x4f30;&#x81b3;&#x98df;&#x56de;&#x61b6;&#x6cd5;&#x53ca;WMRs &#x6240;&#x8a08;&#x7b97;&#x7684;&#x71b1;&#x91cf;&#x53ca;&#x71df;&#x990a;&#x7d20;&#x651d;&#x53d6;&#x76f8;&#x95dc;&#x5f37; &#x5ea6;&#x3002;&#x4ee5;&#x6700;&#x5c0f;&#x7a4d;&#x5dee;&#x8ff4;&#x6b78;&#x8a55;&#x4f30;&#x56fa;&#x5b9a;&#x7684;&#x53ca;&#x6bd4;&#x4f8b;&#x7684;&#x504f;&#x5dee;&#x3002;Bland-Altman &#x5716;&#x88ab;&#x7528;&#x4ee5;&#x4ee5;&#x6e2c;&#x91cf; &#x7cfb;&#x7d71;&#x6216;&#x5dee;&#x5225;&#x504f;&#x5dee;&#x3002;&#x7d50;&#x679c;&#xff1a; &#x5169;&#x7a2e;&#x65b9;&#x6cd5;&#x6240;&#x8a08;&#x7b97;&#x7684;&#x71b1;&#x91cf;&#x53ca;&#x71df;&#x990a;&#x7d20;&#x6709;&#x986f;&#x8457;&#x76f8;&#x95dc;&#x6027; &#xff08;r2=0.19-0.67&#xff0c;p&lt;0.001&#xff09;&#x3002;Bland-Altman &#x5716;&#x6c92;&#x6709;&#x767c;&#x73fe;&#x7cfb;&#x7d71;&#x6027;&#x504f;&#x5dee;&#x3002;&#x56de;&#x61b6;&#x6cd5;&#x5728;&#x86cb; &#x767d;&#x8cea;&#x53ca;&#x8102;&#x80aa;&#x651d;&#x53d6;&#x91cf;&#x6709;&#x7b49;&#x6bd4;&#x4f8b;&#x4f4e;&#x4f30;&#x7684;&#x60c5;&#x5f62;&#x3002;&#x7d50;&#x8ad6;&#xff1a;&#x5728;&#x5370;&#x5ea6;&#x8fb2;&#x6751;&#x65cf;&#x7fa4;&#xff0c;&#x56e0;&#x61c9;&#x6587;&#x5316;&#x7684; &#x9910;&#x98df;&#x56de;&#x61b6;&#x554f;&#x5377;&#x53ef;&#x63d0;&#x4f9b;&#x8a55;&#x4f30;&#x71b1;&#x91cf;&#x3001;&#x5de8;&#x91cf;&#x71df;&#x990a;&#x7d20;&#x53ca;&#x90e8;&#x5206;&#x5fae;&#x91cf;&#x71df;&#x990a;&#x7d20;&#x7684;&#x6b63;&#x78ba;&#x6e2c;&#x91cf;&#x3002;.",2016,1,1,"Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition","10.6133/apjcn.2016.25.1.19",NA,"Asia Pac J Clin Nutr","eng","D000328; D000368; D000369; D015992; D004032; D015930; D002149; D005260; D005502; D006801; D007194; D000067010; D008297; D011939; D008875; D015596; D011203; D011247; D012424; D011795; D055815","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Body Mass Index; Diet; Diet Records; Energy Intake; Female; Food; Humans; India; Literacy; Male; Mental Recall; Middle Aged; Nutrition Assessment; Poverty; Pregnancy; Rural Population; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia."
"26952506","State of the Art Review: Poverty and the Developing Brain.","Sara B Johnson, Jenna L Riis, Kimberly G Noble","In the United States, &gt;40% of children are either poor or near-poor. As a group, children in poverty are more likely to experience worse health and more developmental delay, lower achievement, and more behavioral and emotional problems than their more advantaged peers; however, there is broad variability in outcomes among children exposed to similar conditions. Building on a robust literature from animal models showing that environmental deprivation or enrichment shapes the brain, there has been increasing interest in understanding how the experience of poverty may shape the brain in humans. In this review, we summarize research on the relationship between socioeconomic status and brain development, focusing on studies published in the last 5 years. Drawing on a conceptual framework informed by animal models, we highlight neural plasticity, epigenetics, material deprivation (eg, cognitive stimulation, nutrient deficiencies), stress (eg, negative parenting behaviors), and environmental toxins as factors that may shape the developing brain. We then summarize the existing evidence for the relationship between child poverty and brain structure and function, focusing on brain areas that support memory, emotion regulation, and higher-order cognitive functioning (ie, hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex) and regions that support language and literacy (ie, cortical areas of the left hemisphere).

Little is known about the opinions of primary caregivers regarding the physicians' role in addressing social needs. Our objective was to examine caregivers' opinions about that role and any associations between those opinions, previous exposure to screening for needs by pediatric residents, and socioeconomic status (SES). Cross-sectional survey study of caregivers of hospitalized children. The survey collected information on caregiver opinion regarding their ability to ask physicians for help with social needs, whether physicians know how to help with those needs, and whether physicians should ask about social needs. The chi square test was used to identify associations between caregiver opinions, prior screening by a resident at admission, and SES (determined by census tract median household income). Surveys were completed by 143 caregivers (79% participation). Most respondents agreed that they could ask their physician for help (54.5%), that their physician knows how to help (64.3%), and that physicians should ask about social needs (71.3%). Previously screened caregivers had more favorable opinions about asking for help (76.2% vs 45.5%, P &lt; .01), whether their physician knows how to help (81.0% vs 57.4%, P = .02), and physician screening for unmet needs (85.7% vs 65.3%, P = .03).

The aim of this study was to evaluate validity and reliability of Persian version of PERSEPP scale in Iranian patients with MS. Two-hundred eleven patients with relapsing-remitting form of the disease asked to fill the PERSEPP scale, MSQOL-54, and SF-36 questionnaires. Fifty cases filed the questionnaire 2 weeks later to assess reliability. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach's alpha analysis were used. Mean age and mean duration of disease were 32.2 &#xb1; 8.4 years and 6.5 &#xb1; 2.5 years, respectively. One hundred sixty-seven (79.1%) were female and 44 (20.9%) were male. Forty-one (19.4%) were in relapse phase of the disease. ICC score of all items was above 0.8. Cronbach's alpha of all items was above 0.8. The results show that the mean scores of four items (relationship difficulties, time perspective, and symptoms) were significantly different between cases in relapse and none relapse. Coping and relationship difficulties scores were significantly different between different expanded disability status scale groups.

This systematic review examined the evidence and experience of service user and caregiver involvement in mental health system strengthening, as well as models of best practice for evaluation of capacity-building activities that facilitate their greater participation. Both the peer-reviewed and the grey literature were included in the review, which were identified through database searches (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, SciELO, Google Scholar and Cochrane), as well as hand-searching of reference lists and the internet, and a snowballing process of contacting experts active in the area. This review included any kind of study design that described or evaluated service user, family or caregiver (though not community) involvement in LMICs (including service users with intellectual disabilities, dementia, or child and adolescent mental health problems) and that were relevant to mental health system strengthening across five categories. Data were extracted and summarised as a narrative review. Twenty papers matched the inclusion criteria. Overall, the review found that although there were examples of service user and caregiver involvement in mental health system strengthening in numerous countries, there was a lack of high-quality research and a weak evidence base for the work that was being conducted across countries. However, there was some emerging research on the development of policies and strategies, including advocacy work, and to a lesser extent the development of services, service monitoring and evaluation, with most service user involvement having taken place within advocacy and service delivery. Research was scarce within the other health system strengthening areas. Further research on service user and caregiver involvement in mental health system strengthening in LMICs is recommended, in particular research that includes more rigorous evaluation.

All these factors have an intricate relationship, and arise from a complex and assorted genetic repertoire in the alleles that promote a higher genetic variation in human populations. Sleep disorders have become an uprising public health problem in the modern society; in addition, the correlation between sleep disorders and the development of late chronic diseases has been extensively studied, finding an important causality between them. Therefore, an adequate evaluation of the current situation in a developing continent such as Africa is essential to develop satisfactory health policies.

Whether SSS is uniquely associated with elevated inflammation during young adulthood and whether these linkages differ by sex have not been studied using a nationally representative sample of young adults. Data came from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. At Wave IV, young adults aged mostly 24 to 32 years reported their SSS, oSES, and a range of covariates of both SES and elevated inflammation. Trained fieldworkers assessed medication use, body mass index, and waist circumference, and also collected bloodspots from which high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was assayed. The sample size for the present analyses was n = 13,236. Descriptive and bivariate analyses revealed a graded association between SSS and hs-CRP (b = -0.072, standard error [SE] = 0.011, p &lt; .001): as SSS declined, mean levels of hs-CRP increased. When oSES indicators were taken into account, this association was no longer significant in women (b = -0.013, SE = 0.019, p = .514). In men, a small but significant SSS-hs-CRP association remained after adjusting for oSES indicators and additional potential confounders of this association in the final models (b = -0.034, SE = 0.011 p = .003; p &lt; .001 for the sex by SSS interaction). SSS is independently associated with elevated inflammation in young adults. The associations were stronger in men than in women.

"26905480","The increasing global health priority of substance use in young people.","Louisa Degenhardt, Emily Stockings, George Patton, Wayne D Hall, Michael Lynskey","Substance use in young people (aged 10-24 years) might disrupt key periods of transition that occur as the adolescent brain undergoes cognitive and emotional development, and key psychosocial transitions are made. Adolescence is the peak time for initiation of substance use, with tobacco and alcohol usually preceding the use of illicit drugs. Substantial variation is noted between countries in the levels, types, and sequences of substance use in young people, indicating that a young person's use of substances depends on their social context, drug availability, and their personal characteristics. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study suggests that the burden attributable to substance use increases substantially in adolescence and young adulthood. In young men aged 20-24 years, alcohol and illicit substance use are responsible for 14% of total health burden. Alcohol causes most health burden in eastern Europe, and illicit drug burden is higher in the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and western Europe. Large gaps exist in epidemiological data about the extent of drug use worldwide and much of what we know about the natural history of substance use comes from cohort studies in high-income countries undertaken decades ago, which hinders effective global policy responses. In view of the global epidemiological transitions from diseases of poverty to non-communicable diseases, the burden of disease and health risks among adolescents and young adults is likely to change substantially, in ways that will no doubt see substance use playing an increasingly large part.",2016,3,1,"The lancet.

"26901848","Prefractionation methods for individual adult fruit fly hemolymph proteomic analysis.","Qi Zeng, Vitaly Avilov, Scott A Shippy","The analysis of blood provides in depth chemical information of physiological states of organisms. Hemolymph (blood) is the fluid in the open circulatory system of Drosophila melanogaster that is the medium for molecules regulating a wide variety of physiological activities and signaling between tissues. Adult Drosophila is typically less than 3mm in length and, as a consequence, the available volume of hemolymph is usually less than 50 nL from individual flies. Proteomic analysis of volume-limited hemolymph is a great challenge for both sample handling and subsequent mass spectrometry characterization of this chemically diverse biological fluid with a wide dynamic range of proteins in concentrations. Less abundant proteins, in particular, could be easily lost during sample preparation or missed by current mass spectrometry methods. This article describes simple and customized RPLC column and IEX columns to prefractionate volume-limited hemolymph without excessive dilution. Step-gradient elution methods were developed and optimized to enhance the identification of novel proteins from an individual fruit fly hemolymph sample. Fractions from each step gradient was analyzed by an Agilent nano-RPLC chip column and then characterized by high mass resolution and high mass accuracy orbitrap mass spectrometry. As a result, both RPLC (11 proteins) and IEX fractionation approaches (9 proteins) identified more proteins than an unfractionated control approach with higher protein scores, emPAI values and coverage.

"26894324","The Association Between Childhood Seizures and Later Childhood Emotional and Behavioral Problems: Findings From a Nationally Representative Birth Cohort.","Symon M Kariuki, Charles R J C Newton, Martin J Prince, Jayati Das-Munshi","Emotional/behavioral disorders are often comorbid with childhood epilepsy, but both may be predicted by social disadvantage and fetal risk indicators (FRIs). We used data from a British birth cohort, to assess the association of epilepsy, single unprovoked seizures, and febrile seizures with the later development of emotional/behavioral problems. A total of 17,416 children in the 1958 British birth cohort were followed up until age 16 years. Logistic and modified Poisson regression models were used to determine a) the association of social disadvantage at birth and FRI with epilepsy, single unprovoked seizures, and febrile seizures at 7 years, and emotional/behavioral disorders in later childhood, and (ii) the association of childhood seizures by age 7 years with emotional/behavioral disorders in later childhood, after accounting for social disadvantage and FRI. Higher scores on FRI and social disadvantage were associated with emotional/behavioral problems at 7, 11, and 16 years, but not with seizure disorders at age 7 years. Epilepsy was associated with emotional/behavioral problems at 7 years (odds ratio [OR] = 2.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29-4.84), 11 years (OR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.04-3.81), and 16 years (OR = 5.47, 95% CI = 1.65-18.08), whereas single unprovoked seizures were associated with emotional/behavioral problems at 16 years (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.02-2.01), after adjustment for FRI and social disadvantage. Febrile convulsions were not associated with increased risk for emotional/behavioral problems. Emotional/behavioral problems in children are related to an earlier diagnosis of epilepsy and single unprovoked seizures after accounting for social disadvantage and FRI, whereas febrile convulsions are not associated with emotional/behavioral problems.",2016,6,1,"Psychosomatic medicine","10.1097/PSY.0000000000000305","PMC4880043","Psychosom Med","eng","D000293; D002648; D002652; D004827; D005260; D006798; D006801; D007230; D007234; D008137; D008297; D011203; D011247; D011248; D000066553; D012306; D012640; D003294; D015406; D012923; D006113; D035862","Adolescent; Child; Child Behavior; Epilepsy; Female; Housing; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Premature; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Problem Behavior; Risk; Seizures; Seizures, Febrile; Single Parent; Social Class; United Kingdom; Vulnerable Populations","G0701595; G1001799; MR/N01104X/1; 099782","NA",NA,"From the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme (Kariuki, Newton), Kilifi, Kenya; Department of Psychiatry (Newton), University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; and Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience (Prince, Das-Munshi), King's College London, London, UK."

Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 92 male and female participants recruited from alcohol-serving venues in Cape Town, South Africa. Grounded theory analyses revealed three major aspects of parental drinking - intoxication, venue attendance and expenditures on alcohol - which participants linked to negative proximal outcomes (e.g., child neglect, abuse and exposure to alcohol culture) and long-term outcomes (e.g., fractured parent-child relationships and problematic youth behaviours). In addition, preliminary accounts from some participants suggested that parents may experience tensions between desires to reduce drinking for child-related reasons and complex factors maintaining their drinking behaviour, including the use of alcohol to cope with stressors and trauma. This study provides novel insights into the consequences and motivations of parental drinking in a high-risk context. Contextual risks (e.g., poverty and violence) that exacerbate the impact of parental drinking on children may be the same factors that continue to shape intergenerational alcohol use in this community.

However, the effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility and sustainability of this service model for people with a severe mental disorder (SMD) have not been evaluated in a low-income country. A randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial will be carried out in a predominantly rural area of Ethiopia. A sample of 324 people with SMD (diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder) with an ongoing need for mental health care will be recruited from 1) participants in a population-based cohort study and 2) people attending a psychiatric nurse-led out-patient clinic. The intervention is a task-sharing model of locally delivered mental health care for people with SMD integrated into PHC delivered over 18 months. Participants in the active control arm will receive the established and effective model of specialist mental health care delivered by psychiatric nurses at an out-patient clinic within a centrally located general hospital. The hypothesis is that people with SMD who receive mental health care integrated into PHC will have a non-inferior clinical outcome, defined as a mean symptom score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, expanded version, of no more than six points higher, compared to participants who receive the psychiatric nurse-led service, after 12 months. The primary outcome is change in symptom severity. Secondary outcomes are functional status, relapse, service use costs, service satisfaction, drop-out and medication adherence, nutritional status, physical health care, quality of care, medication side effects, stigma, adverse events and cost-effectiveness. Sustainability and cost-effectiveness will be further evaluated at 18 months. Randomisation will be stratified by health centre catchment area using random permuted blocks. The outcome assessors and investigators will be masked to allocation status. Evidence about the effectiveness of task sharing mental health care for people with SMD in a rural, low-income African country will inform the World Health Organisation's mental health Gap Action Programme to scale-up mental health care globally.

This study illustrates the use of a hybrid methodology for variable selection that took account of missing data and complex survey design to identify key biomarkers associated with depression from a large epidemiological study. The study used a three-step methodology amalgamating multiple imputation, a machine learning boosted regression algorithm and logistic regression, to identify key biomarkers associated with depression in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study (2009-2010). Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and 67 biomarkers were analysed. Covariates in this study included gender, age, race, smoking, food security, Poverty Income Ratio, Body Mass Index, physical activity, alcohol use, medical conditions and medications. The final imputed weighted multiple logistic regression model included possible confounders and moderators. After the creation of 20 imputation data sets from multiple chained regression sequences, machine learning boosted regression initially identified 21 biomarkers associated with depression. Using traditional logistic regression methods, including controlling for possible confounders and moderators, a final set of three biomarkers were selected. The final three biomarkers from the novel hybrid variable selection methodology were red cell distribution width (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.01, 1.30), serum glucose (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.00, 1.01) and total bilirubin (OR 0.12; 95% CI 0.05, 0.28). Significant interactions were found between total bilirubin with Mexican American/Hispanic group (p = 0.016), and current smokers (p&lt;0.001). The systematic use of a hybrid methodology for variable selection, fusing data mining techniques using a machine learning algorithm with traditional statistical modelling, accounted for missing data and complex survey sampling methodology and was demonstrated to be a useful tool for detecting three biomarkers associated with depression for future hypothesis generation: red cell distribution width, serum glucose and total bilirubin.",2016,1,1,"PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0148195","PMC4744063","PLoS One","eng","D000293; D000328; D000368; D000369; D000465; D001663; D015415; D001786; D057225; D003866; D004909; D005260; D006801; D016015; D000069550; D008297; D008875; D015999; D009749; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Bilirubin; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Data Mining; Depressive Disorder; Erythrocyte Indices; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Nutrition Surveys; Young Adult",NA,"10.1093/ije/dys049; 10.1056/NEJMra1201534; 10.1038/mp.2014.139; 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2010.03.006; 10.1037/a0029014; 10.2337/dc09-S001; 10.2337/dc09-9033; 10.1371/journal.pone.0020416; 10.1002/sim.4067; 10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01390.x; 10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01803.x; 10.1370/afm.887; 10.1001/archinternmed.2009.55; 10.1093/eurjhf/hfp179; 10.1016/j.archger.2012.10.002; 10.1007/s00125-011-2331-1; 10.5009/gnl.2011.5.4.460; 10.1016/j.bbi.2009.04.011; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.11.029; 10.2337/dc08-0985; 10.1016/j.diabres.2010.01.024; 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2010.05.004","<b>Competing Interests: </b>JFD has no conflicts of interest.

Subjects were 77 first-time mothers and 126 nulliparous young women from the Pittsburgh Girls Study, a longitudinal study beginning in childhood. Subjects underwent a monetary reward task during functional magnetic resonance imaging in addition to assessment of current depressive symptoms. Life stress was measured by averaging data collected between ages 8-15 years. Using a region-of-interest approach, we conducted hierarchical regression to examine the relationship of psychosocial factors (life stress and current depression) and motherhood with extracted ventral striatal (VST) response to reward anticipation. Whole-brain regression analyses were performed post-hoc to explore non-striatal regions associated with reward anticipation in mothers vs nulliparous women. Anticipation of monetary reward was associated with increased neural activity in expected regions including caudate, orbitofrontal, occipital, superior and middle frontal cortices. There was no main effect of motherhood nor motherhood-by-psychosocial factor interaction effect on VST response during reward anticipation. Depressive symptoms were associated with increased VST activity across the entire sample. In exploratory whole brain analysis, motherhood was associated with increased somatosensory cortex activity to reward (FWE cluster forming threshold p&lt;0.001). These findings indicate that motherhood is not associated with reward anticipation-related VST activity nor does motherhood modulate the impact of depression or life stress on VST activity. Future studies are needed to evaluate whether earlier postpartum assessment of reward function, inclusion of mothers with more severe depressive symptoms, and use of reward tasks specific for social reward might reveal an impact of motherhood on reward system activity.",2016,4,1,"Psychoneuroendocrinology","10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.01.009","PMC4788565","Psychoneuroendocrinology","eng","D000293; D000328; D002648; D002675; D003863; D005260; D006801; D008137; D008913; D009035; D009042; D009434; D016487; D011203; D012201; D013315; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Depression; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Minority Groups; Mothers; Motivation; Neural Pathways; Parenting; Poverty; Reward; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult","MH093605; HD067185; MH056630; R01 HD067185; R01 MH056630; R01 MH093605","NA","<b>Conflict of Interest</b>.

"26801404","Prenatal screening for psychosocial risks in a high risk-population in Peru using the KINDEX interview.","Andria Spyridou, Maggie Schauer, Martina Ruf-Leuschner","Prenatal stress and other prenatal risk factors (e.g. intimate partner violence) have a negative impact on mother's health, fetal development as well as enduring adverse effects on the neuro-cognitive, behavioral and physical health of the child. Mothers of low socio-economic status and especially those living in crime-ridden areas are even more exposed to a host of risk factors. Societies of extreme violence, poverty and inequalities, often present difficulties to provide adequate mental health care to the most needed populations. The KINDEX, a brief standardized instrument that assesses 11 different risk factors was used by midwives to identify pregnant women at-risk, in a suburban area with one of the highest levels of domestic violence in Lima. The instrument was designed to be used by medical staff to identify high-risk child-bearing women and, based on the results, to refer them to the adequate psychological or social support providers. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of psychosocial screening using the KINDEX in a Latin American Country for the first time, and to explore the relationship of the KINDEX with thee major risk areas, maternal psychopathology, perceived stress and traumatic experiences. The study was conducted in cooperation with the gynecological department of a general hospital in a suburban area of Lima. Nine midwives conducted interviews using the KINDEX of ninety-five pregnant women attending the gynecological unit of the hospital. From these, forty pregnant women were re-interviewed by a clinical psychologist using established instruments in order to assess the feasibility of the prenatal assessment in public health settings and the relationship of the KINDEX with maternal perceived stress, psychopathology symptoms and trauma load during pregnancy. We found high rates of risk factors in the examined pregnant women comparable with those found in the general population. Significant correlations were found between the KINDEX sum score and the three risks areas, stress, psychopathology and trauma load as assessed in the Clinical Expert interviews. The different risks assessed by the KINDEX are related to higher levels of stress, psychopathology and trauma load, depending on the risk. The relationship between past adverse experience and current stressors with perceived maternal stress, psychopathology symptoms and traumatic experiences confirm the importance of prenatal assessment for psychosocial risks. The use of KINDEX by midwives providing obstetrical care to pregnant women in urban Peru is feasible and can be used to identify high-risk women and refer them to the adequate mental health or social services for necessary attention and support. Early interventions are essential to mitigating the adverse effects of maternal stress, trauma and psychopathology on the fetus and child.",2016,1,22,"BMC pregnancy and childbirth","10.1186/s12884-016-0799-x","PMC4722714","BMC Pregnancy Childbirth","eng","D000328; D017579; D005240; D005260; D006801; D008880; D010568; D011203; D011247; D011248; D037841; D011296; D011569; D012307; D013315; D014754; D055815","Adult; Domestic Violence; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Midwifery; Peru; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnant Women; Prenatal Diagnosis; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Risk Factors; Stress, Psychological; Violence; Young Adult",NA,"10.1016/j.infbeh.2006.03.003; 10.1097/GRF.0b013e3181b52930; 10.1353/hpu.2008.0003; 10.1007/s00737-003-0034-4; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2003.07.006; 10.1017/S0954579407070186; 10.1002/icd.649; 10.1017/S0954579412000764; 10.1017/S0954579401003170; 10.1111/j.1542-2011.2012.00237.x; 10.1016/0145-2134(94)90083-3; 10.1016/j.ajog.2005.12.052; 10.1016/S0749-3797(03)00094-1; 10.1002/jts.20179; 10.1177/1077801208329387; 10.1111/j.1526-4610.2010.01777.x; 10.1177/0886260512471080; 10.4040/jkan.2012.42.4.477; 10.1016/j.infbeh.2009.10.004; 10.1002/da.10071; 10.1111/jcpp.12153; 10.1371/journal.pone.0116609; 10.1590/S1020-49892009001000004; 10.1016/j.infbeh.2011.02.005; 10.1002/nur.1023; 10.1136/adc.2007.133553; 10.1515/REVEH.2006.21.2.81; 10.1080/10550881003684723; 10.1111/1467-8624.00133; 10.1017/S0954579401003133; 10.1097/01.AOG.0000250535.97920.b5; 10.1023/A:1022537516969; 10.1037/0033-2909.131.5.662; 10.1001/archpedi.1996.02170260068011; 10.1093/humrep/del432; 10.1196/annals.1425.016; 10.1038/jp.2010.54; 10.1007/s00737-003-0169-3; 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2003.tb02529.x; 10.1186/s12884-015-0462-y; 10.1503/cmaj.1040610; 10.1016/j.wombi.2011.06.002; 10.1186/s13034-014-0030-7; 10.1056/NEJMcp1003896; 10.1067/mob.2002.122592; 10.1002/bs.3830190102; 10.1192/bjp.128.3.280; 10.2307/2136404; 10.1097/00006199-198805000-00007; 10.1016/j.jand.2012.07.002; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181d2f0b0; 10.1097/01.AOG.0000119222.40241.fb; 10.1080/01674820600712875; 10.1089/jwh.2009.1854; 10.1097/YCO.0b013e3283503680; 10.1016/j.jmwh.2008.08.001; 10.1007/s00404-012-2286-6; 10.1093/eurpub/cks097; 10.1017/S0033291709990894; 10.1186/1471-2393-13-49; 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2004.00307.x; 10.1111/j.1744-6171.2010.00229.x; 10.1177/0886260507304551; 10.1080/14767050701209560; 10.1126/science.1121400; 10.1067/mob.2003.336; 10.1176/appi.ajp.158.11.1856; 10.1146/annurev.psych.031809.130727",NA,"Center of Excellence for Psychotraumatology, Department of Psychology, Clinical Psychology &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience Unit, University of Konstanz, Post Box D 23, D-78457, Konstanz, Germany."

The cohort consisted of children who had undergone resective epilepsy surgery between 2001 and 2013 in Canada. The patients' postal codes were linked to Statistics Canada National Household Survey data to obtain dissemination area income, which was used to infer SES. Time-to-surgery was defined as the interval from date of epilepsy onset to date of surgery. Seizure outcome was classified using ILAE classification. The associations between SES and TTS, as well as SES and surgical outcome, were assessed. Two hundred eighty-four children who had epilepsy surgery were included. Patients in the lowest income quintile had a significantly higher TTS relative to the highest income quintile (&#x3b2;=0.121, p=0.044). There were no significant associations between income quintiles and seizure-free surgical outcome (odds ratio (OR)=0.746-1.494, all p&gt;0.05). However, patients in the lowest income quintile had a significantly lower odds of an improvement in seizure frequency relative to the highest income quintile (OR=0.262, p=0.046). The TTS was not uniform across SES in spite of the existence of a universal health care system. This finding highlights the need to address social and economic barriers for epilepsy surgery to improve access to this potentially curative treatment. Those with lower SES had lower likelihood of improvement in seizure control following epilepsy surgery and may require additional support including social and financial support to mitigate the discrepancies in seizure control following surgery between SES levels.",2016,2,1,"Epilepsy &amp; behavior : E&amp;B","10.1016/j.yebeh.2015.12.007",NA,"Epilepsy Behav","eng","D000293; D002170; D002648; D002675; D004827; D005260; D006297; D054625; D006801; D007182; D007223; D008297; D019635; D012923; D012959; D013997","Adolescent; Canada; Child; Child, Preschool; Epilepsy; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Income; Infant; Male; Neurosurgical Procedures; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Time Factors",NA,"NA",NA,"Division of Neurology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada; Diagnostic Imaging, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada."

Participants were from a prospective longitudinal study of emotion development. Preschoolers 3-5 years of age were originally ascertained from primary care and day care sites in the St. Louis area and then underwent annual behavioral assessments for up to 12 years. Healthy preschoolers and those with a history of depression symptoms underwent neuroimaging at school age. Using functional MRI, the authors examined whole brain resting-state functional connectivity with the left and right hippocampus and amygdala. Lower income-to-needs ratio at preschool age was associated with reduced connectivity between hippocampus and amygdala and a number of regions at school age, including the superior frontal cortex, lingual gyrus, posterior cingulate, and putamen. Lower income-to-needs ratio predicted greater negative mood/depression severity at school age, as did connectivity between the left hippocampus and the right superior frontal cortex and between the right amygdala and the right lingual gyrus. Connectivity mediated the relationship between income-to-needs ratio and negative mood/depression at the time of scanning. These findings suggest that poverty in early childhood, as assessed by at least one measure, may influence the development of hippocampal and amygdala connectivity in a manner leading to negative mood symptoms during later childhood.",2016,6,1,"The American journal of psychiatry","10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.15081014","PMC4932860","Am J Psychiatry","eng","D000679; D002648; D003863; D005260; D059907; D006624; D006801; D008279; D008297; D009434; D011203","Amygdala; Child; Depression; Female; Functional Neuroimaging; Hippocampus; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neural Pathways; Poverty","R01 MH064769; R01 MH090786; T32 GM008151; T32 MH100019","NA","<b>Disclosures</b>.

One of the known environmental risk factors is exposure to life stressors. The aim of this project is to study the interaction between NR3C1 and CRHBP, genes thought to be involved in stress pathways, exposure to stressful life events, and adolescent alcohol use/misuse. The sample included 541 African American individuals (ages 13-18) from the Genes, Environment, and Neighborhood Initiative, a subset of the Mobile Youth Survey sample from whom DNA and more extensive phenotypic data were collected. Participants were selected from high-poverty neighborhoods in Mobile, Alabama, with potential exposure to a variety of extreme life stressors. A measure of stressful life events was significantly predictive of alcohol use/misuse. In addition, this association was significantly dependent upon the number of putative risk variants at rs1715749, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in CRHBP (P &#x2264; .006). There was no significant interaction between NR3C1 and stressful life events with respect to alcohol use/misuse, after taking into account multiple testing.

We aimed to measure the prevalence and patterns of waterpipe tobacco use and evaluate tobacco control policy with respect to waterpipe tobacco, in several universities across the UK. We also aimed to measure stop smoking practitioners' encounter of waterpipe tobacco smoking. We distributed an online survey to six UK universities, asking detailed questions on waterpipe tobacco. Multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, graduate status, university and socioeconomic status (SES) assessed associations between waterpipe tobacco smoking (single use and dual use with cigarettes) and sociodemographic variables. SES was ascertained by average weekly self-spend on non-essentials. We also descriptively analysed data from a 2012 survey of stop smoking practitioners to assess the proportion of clients that used waterpipe regularly. f 2217 student responses, 66.0% (95% CI 63.9-68.0%) had tried waterpipe tobacco smoking; 14.3% (95% CI 12.8-15.8%) reported past-30 day use, and 8.7% (95% CI 7.6-9.9%) reported at least monthly users. Past-30 day waterpipe-only use was associated with being younger (AOR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91-0.99), male (AOR 1.44, 95% CI 1.08-1.94), higher SES (AOR 1.16, 95% CI 1.06-1.28) and belonging to non-white ethnicities (vs. white, AOR 2.24, 95% CI 1.66-3.04). Compared to less than monthly users, monthly users were significantly more likely to have urges to smoke waterpipe (28.1% vs. 3.1%, p&lt;0.001) report difficulty in quitting (15.5% vs. 0.8%, p&lt;0.001), report feeling guilty, and annoyed when criticised about waterpipe smoking (19.2% vs. 9.2%, p&lt;0.001). Nearly a third (32.5%) of respondents who had tried waterpipe had violated the UK smokefree law and a quarter (24.5%) reporting seeing health warnings on waterpipe tobacco packaging or apparatuses. Of 1,282 smoking cessation practitioners, a quarter (23.4%, 95% CI 21.5-26.1%) reported having some clients who regularly use waterpipes, but 69.5% (95% CI 67.0-72.0%) never ask clients about waterpipe use. Three quarters (74.8%, 95% CI 72.4-77.1%) want more information about waterpipe tobacco smoking. While two thirds of university students have ever tried waterpipe tobacco, at least monthly use is less common. Regular users display features of waterpipe tobacco dependence, and a substantial minority of SSS practitioners encounter clients who regularly use waterpipe. The lack of training on waterpipe for SSS practitioners and reported violations of smokefree laws for waterpipe highlight the need for regular surveillance of and a coordinated tobacco control strategy for waterpipe use.",2016,1,1,"PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0146799","PMC4706414","PLoS One","eng","D000293; D003430; D005260; D006801; D016015; D008297; D015999; D015995; D012907; D016540; D000074606; D013334; D006113; D014495; D055815","Adolescent; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Prevalence; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Smoking Prevention; Students; United Kingdom; Universities; Young Adult",NA,"10.1542/peds.2004-2173; 10.1111/add.12265; 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2013-051206; 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-0939; 10.1093/ntr/nts099; 10.1080/03601234.2013.824300; 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-1422; 10.1016/j.fct.2010.08.033; 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2014.03.036; 10.5152/akd.2013.191; 10.1093/ije/dyq002; 10.1378/chest.10-0991; 10.1111/j.1440-1843.2012.02194.x; 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2014-051903; 10.1093/ntr/ntv101; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.03.003; 10.5588/ijtld.12.0175; 10.1186/1471-2458-8-174; 10.1093/ntr/ntu015; 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2014-051906; 10.1186/1477-7517-10-12; 10.1136/tc.2009.030148; 10.1002/14651858.CD005549.pub2; 10.1136/bmj.g2698; 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2014-051911; 10.1136/tc.2009.031773; 10.1093/ntr/ntt211; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2014.02.012; 10.1093/ntr/ntu022; 10.1016/j.brat.2015.05.013; 10.1093/ntr/nts003; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.04.024; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2007.10.004; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2013.07.009; 10.1007/s10900-011-9444-9; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2011.10.001; 10.5588/ijtld.12.0923; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2014.03.020; 10.5588/ijtld.14.0869; 10.1093/ntr/ntr234; 10.1016/j.puhe.2004.08.002; 10.1093/ntr/ntp066; 10.1093/ntr/ntu196; 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2014-052038; 10.1093/ntr/ntt103","<b>Competing Interests: </b>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom."
"26745277","Social Factors Influencing Child Health in Ghana.","Emmanuel Quansah, Lilian Akorfa Ohene, Linda Norman, Michael Osei Mireku, Thomas K Karikari","Social factors have profound effects on health. Children are especially vulnerable to social influences, particularly in their early years. Adverse social exposures in childhood can lead to chronic disorders later in life. Here, we sought to identify and evaluate the impact of social factors on child health in Ghana. As Ghana is unlikely to achieve the Millennium Development Goals' target of reducing child mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015, we deemed it necessary to identify social determinants that might have contributed to the non-realisation of this goal. ScienceDirect, PubMed, MEDLINE via EBSCO and Google Scholar were searched for published articles reporting on the influence of social factors on child health in Ghana. After screening the 98 articles identified, 34 of them that met our inclusion criteria were selected for qualitative review. Major social factors influencing child health in the country include maternal education, rural-urban disparities (place of residence), family income (wealth/poverty) and high dependency (multiparousity). These factors are associated with child mortality, nutritional status of children, completion of immunisation programmes, health-seeking behaviour and hygiene practices. Several social factors influence child health outcomes in Ghana. Developing more effective responses to these social determinants would require sustainable efforts from all stakeholders including the Government, healthcare providers and families. We recommend the development of interventions that would support families through direct social support initiatives aimed at alleviating poverty and inequality, and indirect approaches targeted at eliminating the dependence of poor health outcomes on social factors. Importantly, the expansion of quality free education interventions to improve would-be-mother's health knowledge is emphasised.",2016,1,1,"PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0145401","PMC4706365","PLoS One","eng","D002648; D000067576; D016208; D003695; D005869; D006291; D006801; D009035; D009752; D012424; D012944","Child; Child Health; Databases, Factual; Delivery of Health Care; Ghana; Health Policy; Humans; Mothers; Nutritional Status; Rural Population; Social Support","BB/J014532/1","10.2105/AJPH.2005.061812; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003463; 10.1542/peds.2015-0491; 10.1155/2015/298409; 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61690-6; 10.1056/NEJMra0708473; 10.1017/S0954579400004776; 10.1007/BF02888596; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097; 10.1017/S1368980007226035; 10.1016/0167-6296(95)00021-6; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.11.032; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2006.01660.x; 10.1016/j.jhealeco.2013.08.001; 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005340; 10.1016/j.healthplace.2008.05.002; 10.1017/S0021932014000340; 10.1016/S0169-5150(97)00011-X; 10.1093/heapol/10.3.312; 10.1007/s001480050080; 10.1111/tmi.12324; 10.1017/S0021932007001927; 10.1017/S1368980014000834; 10.1186/1472-698X-14-24; 10.1186/1471-2393-14-165; 10.1371/journal.pone.0017774; 10.1093/heapro/dau069; 10.1016/S0305-750X(99)00097-2; 10.1186/1475-9276-6-21; 10.1186/s12889-014-1332-7; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.08.057; 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61257-3; 10.2307/3004028; 10.1017/S0021932012000041; 10.1016/S0277-9536(96)00224-9; 10.1016/j.healthplace.2014.06.003; 10.1177/0141076813489680; 10.1080/03050060902920534; 10.1016/j.ijedudev.2012.09.011; 10.1186/1478-4491-9-13; 10.1371/journal.pone.0120556; 10.1186/1742-4755-11-90; 10.1186/1472-6963-14-340; 10.1002/hpm.2304; 10.1186/s12889-015-1696-3; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.10.025; 10.1186/s12913-014-0637-7; 10.1186/s12913-015-0996-8; 10.1080/08959420.2015.1056650; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02439.x; 10.1186/s12913-015-0762-y; 10.1590/0104-1169.3308.2434; 10.1186/1478-4505-12-16; 10.1186/1471-2393-13-211; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2007.01981.x; 10.1186/1471-2393-12-50; 10.1179/146532810X12858955921311","<b>Competing Interests: </b>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Neuroscience, School of Life Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, Uunited Kingdom."

Bovine adrenal glands were obtained from an abattoir, and the ZF was isolated. Strips of ZF were then exposed to different concentration of murine IL-6 and/or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) for various intervals, the protein and mRNA extracted, and the mRNA and protein expression determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blots. Exposure (1 h) to IL-6 increased in a concentration-dependent manner (10-pg IL-6/mL, P &lt; 0.05 vs control; 100-pg IL-6/mL, P &lt; 0.01 vs control) the relative expression of the mRNAs and proteins for steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), 3&#x3b2; hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (3&#x3b2; HSD), 17&#x3b1;-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase/17,20-desmolase (P450 17OH), steroid 21-hydroxylase (P450 21OH), steroid 11-&#x3b2;-hydroxylase type 1 (P450 11&#x3b2;OH), and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), a nuclear factor that increases StAR and steroidogenic enzymes (SEs) expression. Similarly, IL-6 (10 pg/mL) increased the relative expression of proteins and mRNAs for StAR, P450scc, 3&#x3b2; HSD, P450 17OH, P450 21 OH, P450 11&#x3b2;OH, and SF-1 in a time-dependent manner (30 min, P &lt; 0.05 vs control; 60, 120, and 240 min, P &lt; 0.01 vs control). In contrast, IL-6 decreased in a concentration-dependent (P &lt; 0.01 vs control for 1, 10, and 100 pg IL-6/mL) and time-dependent (P &lt; 0.05 vs control for 30, 60,120, and 240 min of 10 pg IL-6/mL) manner the relative expression of the mRNA and protein for adrenal hypoplasia congenita-like protein (DAX-1), a nuclear factor that decreases expression of StAR and SEs. Incubation (1 h) of ZF with 100-nM ACTH increased (P &lt; 0.05 vs control) the relative expression of StAR, P450scc, 3&#x3b2; HSD, P450 17OH, P450 21OH, P450 11&#x3b2;OH, and SF-1 and decreased (P &lt; 0.01 vs control) the relative expression of DAX-1. Murine IL-6 (10 pg/mL) augmented (P &lt; 0.05 vs ACTH) both the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of ACTH. Bovine IL-6 (100 pg/mL, 1-h incubation) also increased (P &lt; 0.01 vs control) the relative expression of the proteins for StAR, P450scc, and SF-1 and decreased (P &lt; 0.01 vs control) the relative expression of DAX-1. In summary, IL-6 increased ZF expression of StAR and 5 SEs, which may be mediated in part by decreasing DAX-1 expression and increasing SF-1 expression.",2016,4,1,"Domestic animal endocrinology","10.1016/j.domaniend.2015.10.003",NA,"Domest Anim Endocrinol","eng","D000324; D000818; D002417; D003577; D057137; D005786; D015850; D051379; D010750; D012333; D011994; D054339; D013256; D015383","Adrenocorticotropic Hormone; Animals; Cattle; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; DAX-1 Orphan Nuclear Receptor; Gene Expression Regulation; Interleukin-6; Mice; Phosphoproteins; RNA, Messenger; Recombinant Proteins; Steroidogenic Factor 1; Steroids; Zona Fasciculata",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Physiology and Developmental Biology and Neuroscience Center, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, 84602, USA."

"26691027","Heavy eye syndrome versus sagging eye syndrome in high myopia.","Roland Joseph D Tan, Joseph L Demer","Heavy eye syndrome (HES) presents with esotropia and limited abduction due to superotemporal globe shift relative to the extraocular muscles. Sagging eye syndrome (SES) was originally described in nonmyopic patients exhibiting distance esotropia and cyclovertical strabismus with limited supraduction due to lateral rectus muscle inferodisplacement caused by degeneration of the lateral rectus-superior rectus (LR-SR) band. We hypothesized that SES might also cause strabismus in high myopia. Eleven strabismic subjects with high myopia underwent ophthalmological examination and orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess quantitative orbital anatomy. Of 11 subjects, 5 had HES; 6, SES. Mean axial length in subjects with HES was 32&#xa0;&#xb1; 5 mm; in subjects with SES, 32 &#xb1; 6 mm. Average distance esotropia in subjects with HES was 61(&#x394;) &#xb1; 39(&#x394;); hypotropia was 26(&#x394;) &#xb1; 21(&#x394;). Average distance esotropia in subjects with SES was 23(&#x394;) &#xb1; 57(&#x394;); hypertropia was 2(&#x394;) &#xb1; 2(&#x394;). All 5 subjects with HES had superotemporal globe prolapse; the LR-SR band was thinned in 6 orbits and ruptured in 2. The mean angle between the lateral rectus and superior rectus muscles in HES was 121&#xb0; &#xb1; 7&#xb0;. In SES the LR-SR band was thinned in 7 orbits and ruptured in 5, with superotemporal soft tissue prolapse. The mean angle between the lateral rectus and superior rectus muscles was 104&#xb0; &#xb1; 11&#xb0;, significantly less than in HES (P &lt; 0.001). SES occurs in highly myopic patients who also exhibit less relative globe dislocation than in HES. Unlike HES, SES exhibits superotemporal soft tissue prolapse that may limit superotemporal globe shift. The distinction is important because surgery for HES uniquely requires creation of a surgical connection between the superior rectus and lateral rectus muscles, whereas SES may be treated with conventional surgery. SES can cause strabismus in high axial myopia. Orbital MRI is useful in differentiating SES from HES.",2015,12,1,"Journal of AAPOS : the official publication of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus","10.1016/j.jaapos.2015.08.012","PMC4688571","J AAPOS","eng","D000368; D058452; D003240; D004948; D005260; D006801; D008279; D008297; D008875; D047728; D015835; D009801; D013577","Aged; Axial Length, Eye; Connective Tissue Diseases; Esotropia; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Myopia, Degenerative; Ocular Motility Disorders; Oculomotor Muscles; Syndrome","P30 EY000331; R01 EY008313; EY08313","NA",NA,"Stein Eye Institute, University of California, Los Angeles; Department of Neurology, University of California, Los Angeles; Neuroscience Interdepartmental Program, University of California, Los Angeles; Bioengineering Interdepartmental Program, University of California, Los Angeles."

However, it is unclear whether the effects of SES on academic development operate universally in all children equally or whether they vary differentially in children with particular characteristics. The current study aimed to explore children's temperament as protective or risk factors that potentially moderate the associations between SES risks and academic development. Specifically, latent growth modeling (LGM) was used in two longitudinal datasets with a total of 2236 children to examine how family SES risks and children's temperament interactively predicted the development of reading and math from middle childhood to early adolescence. Results showed that low negative affect, high effortful control, and low surgency mitigated the negative associations between SES risks and both reading and math development in this developmental period. These findings underline the heterogeneous nature of the negative associations between SES risks and academic development and highlight the importance of the interplay between biological and social factors on individual differences in development.",2017,5,1,"Developmental science","10.1111/desc.12380","PMC4916056","Dev Sci","eng","D000073978; D002648; D002657; D005260; D006801; D007206; D008297; D008433; D011932; D012959; D013694","Academic Performance; Child; Child Development; Female; Humans; Individuality; Male; Mathematics; Reading; Socioeconomic Factors; Temperament","R01 HD068728; R24 HD075460; R01 HD038075; P50 HD027802; R01 HD059215","NA",NA,"Department of Psychology, The Ohio State University, USA."

This project evaluated the feasibility and usefulness of adding a consumer-products design method to qualitative methods implemented within a community-based participatory research (CBPR) framework. Discrete-choice conjoint experiment (DCE) added to systematic focus group data collection and analysis. Focus group data were collected from 64 patients of a Federally-Qualified Health Center (FQHC) serving a predominantly low-income Hispanic population. A total of 604 patients in the waiting rooms of the FQHC responded to the DCE. The DCE contained 15 choice tasks that each asked respondents to choose between three mental health services options described by the levels of two (of eight) attributes based on themes that emerged from focus group data. The addition of the DCE was found to be feasible and useful in providing distinct information on relative patient preferences compared with the focus group analyses alone. According to market simulations, the package of mental health services guided by the results of the DCE was preferred by patients. Unique patterns of patient preferences were uncovered by the DCE and these findings were useful in identifying pragmatic solutions to better address the mental health service needs of this population.

We tested the hypothesis that maternal fatigue would be associated independently with maternal common mental disorder ('maternal CMD') in a rural, low-income country setting. The analysis was conducted using data from a population-based cohort located in the Butajira demographic surveillance site, Ethiopia. A total of 1065 women were recruited in pregnancy and followed up to 2.5 (n = 1009; 94.7%) and 3.5 years post-partum (n = 989; 92.9%). Maternal CMD symptoms were measured using a locally validated version of the Self-Reporting Questionnaire and fatigue was measured using a dichotomised item from the Patient Health Questionnaire-15. Physical health indicators included haemoglobin level, body mass index and illness episodes. Generalised estimating equations were used to conduct hypothesis-driven and exploratory multivariable analyses in the panel at 2.5 and 3.5 years. The prevalence of maternal fatigue was 8.3% at 2.5 years and 5.5% at 3.5 years post-partum. Psychological symptoms of maternal CMD were associated independently with complaints of fatigue after adjusting for anaemia, body mass index, physical ill health, poverty and other confounding variables: adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.28-1.66 for each one point increase in SRQ score. In the multivariable model, only psychosocial factors (CMD and stressful life events) and self-reported physical ill health were associated significantly with complaints of fatigue. Complaints of fatigue are associated strongly with maternal CMD and other psychosocial risk factors in this rural, low-income country setting with a high burden of undernutrition and infectious disease. Fatigue should be understood as a potential indicator of CMD in primary care to improve detection and treatment.

"26681612","Diversity and representation: Key issues for psychophysiological science.","Lisa M Gatzke-Kopp","This Special Issue is devoted to the illustration and discussion of three key demographic variables (sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status) that have been shown to moderate associations between psychophysiological processes and behavior. The introduction to the issue discusses the role of phenotypic plasticity in the emergence of different neural processes that achieve the same behavioral outcome, with emphasis on how these relatively stable developmental contexts affect brain/behavior associations without necessarily resulting in difference in behavior.

"26605565","Health care and social service professionals' perceptions of a home-visit program for young, first-time mothers.","S A Li, S M Jack, A Gonzalez, E Duku, H L MacMillan","Little is known about health care and social service professionals' perspective on the acceptability of long-term home-visit programs serving low-income, first-time mothers. This study describes the experiences and perspectives of these community care providers involved with program referrals or service delivery to mothers who participated in the Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP), a targeted nurse home-visit program. The study included two phases. Phase I was a secondary qualitative data analysis used to analyze a purposeful sample of 24 individual interviews of community care providers. This was part of a larger case study examining adaptations required to increase acceptability of the NFP in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. In Phase II (n = 4), themes identified from Phase I were further explored through individual, semi-structured interviews with community health care and social service providers, giving qualitative description. Overall, the NFP was viewed as addressing an important service gap for first-time mothers. Providers suggested that frequent communication between the NFP and community agencies serving these mothers could help improve the referral process, avoid service duplication, and streamline the flow of service access. The findings can help determine key components required to enhance the success of integrating a home-visit program into an existing network of community services. The function of home-visit programs should not be viewed in isolation. Rather, their potential can be maximized when they collaborate and share information with other agencies to provide better services for first-time mothers.

"26605564","Adapting, piloting and evaluating complex public health interventions: lessons learned from the Nurse-Family Partnership in Canadian public health settings.","S M Jack, N Catherine, A Gonzalez, H L MacMillan, D Sheehan, D Waddell","The Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) is a home-visit program for young and first-time, socially and economically disadvantaged mothers. Evidence from three United States randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness of this intervention at improving pregnancy outcomes, improving child health and development, and increasing maternal economic self-sufficiency is robust. However, the effectiveness of the NFP in Canada, with its different health and social care context, needs to be determined. The purpose of this article is to describe the complex process for moving the NFP from the research arena to full implementation in Canada. This process of evaluation in Canada includes (1) adapting the intervention; (2) piloting the intervention in small-scale feasibility and acceptability studies; and (3) conducting an RCT and process evaluation through a study called the British Columbia Healthy Connections Project (BCHCP). This large-scale evaluation also creates an opportunity to expand the NFP evidence base by conducting an additional study to examine potential biological mechanisms linking intervention and behavioural outcomes in children. Adaptation of the NFP home-visit materials is a continuous process. A pilot project determined that it was feasible to enrol eligible women into the NFP. This pilot also determined that, in Canada, it was most appropriate for public health agencies to implement the NFP and for public health nurses to deliver the intervention. Finally, the pilot showed that this intensive home-visit program was acceptable to clients, their family members and health care providers. Through the BCHCP, the next steps - the RCT and process evaluation - are currently underway. The BCHCP will also set the foundation for long-term evaluation of key public health outcomes in a highly vulnerable population of families.

While most of these studies have explored individual viral, bacterial, and even parasitic sources of infection, few have considered the potential neurocognitive burden associated with multiple infections. In this study, we utilized publically available data from a large dataset produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that included measures of neurocognitive function, sociodemographic variables, and serum antibody data for several infectious diseases. Specifically, immunoglobulin G antibodies for toxocariasis, toxoplasmosis, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus, and herpes 1 and 2 were available in 5662 subjects. We calculated an overall index of infectious-disease burden to determine if an aggregate measure of exposure to infectious disease would be associated with neurocognitive function in adults aged 20-59 years. The index predicted processing speed and learning and memory but not reaction time after controlling for age, sex, race-ethnicity, immigration status, education, and the poverty-to-income ratio. Interactions between the infectious-disease index and some sociodemographic variables were also associated with neurocognitive function.

Many of the differences are explained by the wide variation in population demographics and size, poverty, conflict, culture, land area and quality, and genetics. Neurological, psychiatric, developmental and substance-use disorders that result from, or are worsened by, a lack of adequate nutrition and infectious disease still afflict much of sub-Saharan Africa, although disorders related to increasing longevity, such as stroke, are on the rise. In the Middle East and North Africa, major depressive disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder are a primary concern because of the conflict-ridden environment. Consanguinity is a serious concern that leads to the high prevalence of recessive disorders in the Middle East and North Africa and possibly other regions. The burden of these disorders in Latin American and Asian countries largely surrounds stroke and vascular disease, dementia and lifestyle factors that are influenced by genetics. Although much knowledge has been gained over the past 10 years, the epidemiology of the conditions in low- and middle-income countries still needs more research. Prevention and treatments could be better informed with more longitudinal studies of risk factors. Challenges and opportunities for ameliorating nervous-system disorders can benefit from both local and regional research collaborations. The lack of resources and infrastructure for health-care and related research, both in terms of personnel and equipment, along with the stigma associated with the physical or behavioural manifestations of some disorders have hampered progress in understanding the disease burden and improving brain health.

This gap exists despite potentially greater dependence on social networks for support and survival due to various barriers to health care and social protection schemes in this setting. Thus, this study aims to examine how social network type at baseline predicts all-cause mortality among older adults in six Latin American countries, China, and India. Population-based surveys were conducted of all individuals aged 65+ years in eight countries (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Peru, Venezuela, Mexico, Puerto Rico, China, and India). Data on mortality were obtained at follow-up (mean 3.8 years after cohort inception). Follow-up data for 13,891 individuals were analysed. Social network types were assessed using Wenger's Practitioner Assessment of Network Type (PANT). Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to estimate the impact of social network type on mortality risk in each country, adjusting for socio-demographics, receipt of pension, disability, medical conditions, and depression. Meta-analysis was performed to obtain pooled estimates. The prevalence of private network type was 64.4% in urban China and 1.6% in rural China, while the prevalence of locally integrated type was 6.6% in urban China and 86.8% in rural China. The adjusted pooled estimates across (a) all countries and (b) Latin America showed that, compared to the locally integrated social network type, the locally self-contained [(b) HR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.01-1.51], family dependent [(a) HR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.26; (b) HR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.001-1.28], and private [(a) HR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.06-1.73; (b) HR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.20-1.75] social network types were significantly associated with higher mortality risk. Survival time is significantly reduced in individuals embedded in restricted social networks (i.e. locally self-contained, family dependent, and private network types). Social care interventions may be enhanced by addressing the needs of those most at risk of neglect and deteriorating health.

These diseases are concentrated in rural areas, conflict zones and urban slums in Africa and other tropical areas. While the World Health Organization recognizes seventeen priority NTDs, the list of conditions present in Africa and elsewhere that are eligible to be classified as NTDs is much longer. Although NTDs are generally marginalized, their associated neurological burden has been almost completely disregarded. However, reports indicate that trichuriasis, schistosomiasis and hookworm infection, among others, cause impairments in memory and cognition, negatively affecting school attendance rates and educational performance particularly among children, as well as agricultural productivity among adults. Consequently, the neurological impairments have substantial influence on education and economic productivity, thus aggravating and perpetuating poverty in affected societies. However, inadequate research, policy and public health attention has been paid to the neurological burdens associated with NTDs. In order to appropriately address these burdens, we recommend the development of policy interventions that focus on the following areas: (i) the introduction of training programs to develop the capacity of scientists and clinicians in research, diagnostic and treatment approaches (ii) the establishment of competitive research grant schemes to fund cutting-edge research into these neurological impairments, and (iii) the development of public health interventions to improve community awareness of the NTD-associated neurological problems, possibly enhancing disease prevention and expediting treatment.",2016,6,1,"eNeurologicalSci","10.1016/j.ensci.2015.11.002","PMC5312664","eNeurologicalSci","eng",NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,"Neuroscience, School of Life Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK; Midlands Integrative Biosciences Training Partnership, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK."

To synthesise what is known globally about effective interventions to reduce mental illness-based stigma and discrimination, in relation first to effectiveness in the medium and long term (minimum 4 weeks), and second to interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We searched six databases from 1980 to 2013 and conducted a multi-language Google search for quantitative studies addressing the research questions. Effect sizes were calculated from eligible studies where possible, and narrative syntheses conducted. Subgroup analysis compared interventions with and without social contact. Eighty studies (n = 422 653) were included in the review. For studies with medium or long-term follow-up (72, of which 21 had calculable effect sizes) median standardised mean differences were 0.54 for knowledge and -0.26 for stigmatising attitudes. Those containing social contact (direct or indirect) were not more effective than those without. The 11 LMIC studies were all from middle-income countries. Effect sizes were rarely calculable for behavioural outcomes or in LMIC studies. There is modest evidence for the effectiveness of anti-stigma interventions beyond 4 weeks follow-up in terms of increasing knowledge and reducing stigmatising attitudes. Evidence does not support the view that social contact is the more effective type of intervention for improving attitudes in the medium to long term.

Epidemiological studies have suggested that this covariation is due, in part, to common genetic influences, and a number of plausible candidates have emerged as targets for investigation. To date, however, genetic association studies of these behaviors have focused mostly on unidimensional models of individual phenotypes within European American samples. Herein, we compared a series of confirmatory factor models to best characterize the structure of problem behavior (alcohol and marijuana use, sexual behavior, and disruptive behavior) within a representative community-based sample of 592 low-income African American adolescents (50.3% female), ages 13 to 18. We further explored the extent to which 3 genes previously implicated for their role in similar behavioral dimensions (CHRM2, GABRA2, and OPRM1) independently accounted for variance within factors specified in the best-fitting model. Supplementary analyses were conducted to derive comparative estimates for the predictive utility of these genes in more traditional unidimensional models. Findings provide initial evidence for a bifactor structure of problem behavior among African American adolescents and highlight novel genetic correlates of specific behavioral dimensions otherwise undetected in an orthogonal syndromal factor. Implications of this approach include increased precision in the assessment of problem behavior, with corresponding increases in the reliability and validity of identified genetic associations. As a corollary, the comparison of primary and supplementary association analyses illustrates the potential for overlooking and/or overinterpreting meaningful genetic effects when failing to adequately account for phenotypic complexity.",2017,1,1,"Journal of clinical child and adolescent psychology : the official journal for the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, American Psychological Association, Division 53","10.1080/15374416.2015.1070353","PMC4851603","J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol","eng","D000293; D000294; D001741; D005260; D006801; D008297; D011203; D000066553; D015203; D014481","Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Black or African American; Female; Humans; Male; Poverty; Problem Behavior; Reproducibility of Results; United States","K01 AA020333; K02 AA018755; R01 DA025039","10.1101/gr.094052.109; 10.1017/S0954579400004612; 10.1093/bioinformatics/bth457; 10.1037/0033-2909.88.3.588; 10.1016/S0193-953X(05)70074-5; 10.1177/0049124192021002005; 10.1007/s00127-013-0657-3; 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2011.00739.x; 10.1111/j.1745-7599.2012.00702.x; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.02.004; 10.1037/a0022939; 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00530.x; 10.1001/archpsyc.65.3.310; 10.1007/s10519-005-9041-8; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.90; 10.3389/fpsyt.2011.00017; 10.1038/sj.mp.4001368; 10.1097/00004583-200106000-00008; 10.1037/0022-006X.53.6.890; 10.1037/0022-006X.56.5.762; 10.1086/383283; 10.1186/1471-2350-9-35; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2009.02.009; 10.1007/s10802-011-9511-9; 10.1080/10705519909540118; 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01637.x; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1987.tb01490.x; 10.1037/0012-1649.31.6.923; 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2010.01427.x; 10.1001/archpsyc.60.9.929; 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp218; 10.1037/0021-843X.109.3.488; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01640.x; 10.1038/jhg.2010.150; 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2008.00768.x; 10.1186/1471-2156-6-S1-S104; 10.1073/pnas.1031521100; 10.1002/ajmg.b.20034; 10.1001/archpsyc.62.12.1352; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02232.x; 10.1093/hmg/ddn289; 10.1037/0022-006X.60.5.766; 10.1111/jora.12053; 10.1007/s10508-013-0215-9; 10.1037/0022-0167.49.2.172; 10.1086/383251; 10.1371/journal.pone.0034861; 10.1177/0272431607313591; 10.1007/s11136-007-9183-7; 10.1037/0022-006X.63.4.594; 10.1186/gb-2002-3-7-comment2007; 10.1016/j.paid.2014.11.036; 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.01120.x; 10.1097/00004583-200001000-00014; 10.1111/j.1521-0391.2012.00253.x; 10.1001/archpsyc.62.9.1042; 10.1038/nrg796; 10.1007/BF02291170; 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003235; 10.1371/journal.pone.0013929; 10.1073/pnas.0812612106; 10.2307/270754; 10.1093/hmg/ddl024",NA,"c Department of Psychiatry , Virginia Commonwealth University."

Realistic, naturalistic studies are necessary to represent the entire population of first episode of psychosis attended in daily practice. Sixteen participating centers from the PEPs project recruited 335 first episode of psychosis patients, aged 7 to 35 years. This article describes and discusses the psychopharmacological interventions and safety profiles at baseline and during a 60-day pharmacovigilance period. The majority of first episode of psychosis patients received a second-generation antipsychotic (96.3%), orally (95%), and in adjusted doses according to the product specifications (87.2%). A total of 24% were receiving an antipsychotic polytherapy pattern at baseline, frequently associated with lower or higher doses of antipsychotics than the recommended ones. Eight patients were taking clozapine, all in monotherapy. Males received higher doses of antipsychotic (P=.043). A total of 5.2% of the patients were being treated with long-acting injectable antipsychotics; 12.2% of the patients received anticholinergic drugs, 12.2% antidepressants, and 13.7% mood stabilizers, while almost 40% received benzodiazepines; and 35.52% reported at least one adverse drug reaction during the pharmacovigilance period, more frequently associated with higher antipsychotic doses and antipsychotic polytherapy (85.2% vs 45.5%, P&lt;.001). These data indicate that the overall pharmacologic prescription for treating a first episode of psychosis in Spain follows the clinical practice guideline recommendations, and, together with security issues, support future research of determinate pharmacological strategies for the treatment of early phases of psychosis, such as the role of clozapine, long-acting injectable antipsychotics, antipsychotic combination, and the use of benzodiazepines.",2016,4,1,"The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology","10.1093/ijnp/pyv121","PMC4851267","Int J Neuropsychopharmacol","eng","D000208; D000293; D000328; D014150; D002648; D005260; D006801; D016015; D008297; D060735; D019338; D011569; D011618; D012737; D013030; D016896; D055815","Acute Disease; Adolescent; Adult; Antipsychotic Agents; Child; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Pharmacovigilance; Polypharmacy; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychotic Disorders; Sex Factors; Spain; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",NA,"NA",NA,"Barcelona Cl&#xed;nic Schizophrenia Unit, Hospital Cl&#xed;nic de Barcelona, CIBERSAM, Barcelona, Spain (Drs Bioque, Cabrera, Mezquida, and Bernardo); CICAB-CAIBER Centro de Investigaci&#xf3;n Cl&#xed;nica, Hospital Universitario, Servicio Extreme&#xf1;o de Salud SES, Facultad de Medicina Universidad de Extremadura, CIBERSAM, Badajoz, Spain (Dr Llerena); Instituto de Investigaci&#xf3;n Sanitaria Arag&#xf3;n (IIS Arag&#xf3;n), University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain (Dr Lobo); Department of Psychiatry, Hospital Universitario de Alava, CIBERSAM, University of the Basque Country, Vitoria, Spain (Dr Gonz&#xe1;lez-Pinto); Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara&#xf1;&#xf3;n, IiSGM, CIBERSAM, School of Medicine, Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain (Drs D&#xed;az-Caneja and Parellada); Department of Psychiatry, Hospital de Sant Pau, CIBERSAM, Barcelona, Spain (Dr Corripio); Clinic Hospital Valencia, INCLIVA, CIBERSAM, Valencia University, Valencia, Spain (Dr Aguilar); Department of Psychiatry, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, IMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Barcelona, Spain (Dr Bulbena); Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychology, SGR-489, Neurosciences Institute, Hospital Cl&#xed;nic of Barcelona, IDIBAPS, CIBERSAM, University of Barcelona, Spain (Dr Castro-Fornieles); Hospital Cl&#xed;nic de Barcelona, Universitat de Barcelona, IDIBAPS, CIBERSAM, Barcelona, Spain (Dr Vieta); Department of Pathological Anatomy, Pharmacology and Microbiology, University of Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biom&#xe8;diques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), CIBERSAM, Barcelona, Spain (Drs Lafuente and Mas); Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, CIBERSAM, Madrid, Spain (Dr Saiz-Ruiz); Servicio de Psiquiatr&#xed;a, Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Instituto de Investigaci&#xf3;n Sanitaria de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain (Dr Cuesta); Universitat de Barcelona, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain (Dr Bernardo)."

We used nationally represented, population-based data from the second China National Sample Survey on Disability, conducted in 2006. A total of 1,724,398 study subjects between the ages of 15 and 64, including 10,095 subjects with mental disability only, were used for the analysis. Wealth status was estimated by a wealth index that was derived from a principal component analysis of 10 household assets and four other variables related to wealth. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for mental disability for each category, with the lowest quintile category as the referent. Confounding variables under consideration were age, gender, residence area, marital status, ethnicity, education, current employment status, household size, house type, homeownership and living arrangement. The distribution of various types and severities of mental disability differed significantly by wealth index category in the present population. Wealth index category had a positive association with mild mental disability (p for trend &lt;0.01), but had a negative association with extremely severe mental disability (p for trend &lt;0.01). Moreover, wealth index category had a significant, inverse association with mental disability when all severities of mental disability were taken into consideration. This study's results suggest that wealth is a significant factor in the distribution of mental disability and it might have different influences on various types and severities of mental disability.",2015,10,19,"International journal of environmental research and public health","10.3390/ijerph121013104","PMC4627019","Int J Environ Res Public Health","eng","D000293; D000328; D000368; D044466; D002681; D015986; D006233; D005191; D005260; D006801; D008607; D008297; D001523; D008875; D016017; D011203; D012107; D012111; D012424; D012959; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Asian People; China; Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic; Disabled Persons; Family Characteristics; Female; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Poverty; Research Design; Residence Characteristics; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult",NA,"10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61238-0; 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60660-7; 10.2471/BLT.11.089730; 10.1136/jech.57.7.501; 10.1080/14034940410019190; 10.1093/eurpub/cki070; 10.1177/00343552070500040101; 10.1111/j.1475-4991.2012.00520.x; 10.1016/j.chieco.2014.05.017; 10.1177/1044207311411299; 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16458-1; 10.1073/pnas.1403158111",NA,"Institute of Population Research/WHO Collaborating Center on Reproductive Health and Population Science, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."

Oxytocin appears to be a potent modulator of amygdala reactivity and neuroendocrine responses to psychosocial stress. Given these stress regulatory effects, there is increasing interest in understanding the role of oxytocin in vulnerability to stress-related clinical disorders. The present study examines the impact of a common functional variant within the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene (rs2254298) on structure and function of the amygdala in a high-risk sample of urban, low-income, minority youth with a high incidence of early life stress (ELS). Compared to G/G homozygotes, youth carrying the OXTR A-allele showed increased amygdala volume, reduced behavioral performance, and heightened amygdala response during two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks that involved viewing socially-relevant face stimuli. Higher amygdala response was related to ELS in A-allele carriers but not G/G homozygotes. These findings underscore a series of relations among a common oxytocin system gene variant, ELS exposure, and structure and function of the amygdala in early life. Heightened amygdala response to salient social cues in OXTR A-allele carriers may elevate risk for emotional psychopathology by increasing amygdala involvement in disambiguating environmental cues, particularly for individuals with ELS.",2015,12,1,"Neuropsychologia","10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.10.015","PMC4679629","Neuropsychologia","eng","D000293; D000679; D002648; D003463; D004644; D005260; D007839; D005838; D066128; D006801; D007091; D008279; D008297; D008913; D010100; D010364; D010775; D020641; D011203; D011569; D018045; D013315","Adolescent; Amygdala; Child; Cues; Emotions; Female; Functional Laterality; Genotype; Gray Matter; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Minority Groups; Oxygen; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Photic Stimulation; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Poverty; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Receptors, Oxytocin; Stress, Psychological","R01 NS074980; P30ES020957; R01NS074980; P30 CA022453; P30CA022453; P30 ES020957; R01 HD075806; R21 ES026022","NA",NA,"Merill Palmer Skillman Institute for Child and Family Development, Wayne State University, 71 E Ferry Street, Dertroit, MI 48202, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, USA."

In addition, we test to determine whether expected cumulative risk elevations in amygdala volume would mediate functional reactivity of the amygdala during socioemotional processing. Risks included substandard housing quality, noise, crowding, family turmoil, child separation from family, and violence. Total and left hemisphere adult amygdala volumes were positively related to cumulative risk exposure during childhood. The links between childhood cumulative risk exposure and elevated amygdala responses to emotionally neutral facial stimuli in adulthood were mediated by the corresponding amygdala volumes. Cumulative risk exposure in later adolescence (17 years of age), however, was unrelated to subsequent adult amygdala volume or function. Physical and socioemotional risk exposures early in life appear to alter amygdala development, rendering adults more reactive to ambiguous stimuli such as neutral faces.

Programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been suggested as one mediating process. In order to investigate possible long term effects of stressors during pregnancy, we followed 70 children and their mothers from pregnancy up to nine years aiming to investigate if maternal cortisol levels and distress/exposure to partner violence were associated with child psychiatric symptoms and child cortisol levels at follow-up. Maternal distress was evaluated using The Self Reporting Questionnaire, exposure to partner violence by an instrument from WHO and child psychiatric symptoms with Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). We adjusted the analyses for gestational week, gender, SES, perinatal data and maternal distress/exposure to partner violence at child age of nine years. Elevated maternal cortisol levels during pregnancy, as a possible marker of maternal stress load, were correlated with higher CBCL-ratings, especially concerning externalizing symptoms. Maternal cortisol levels during pregnancy were not associated with child cortisol levels at child age of nine years. Maternal distress and exposure to partner violence during pregnancy were neither associated with child psychiatric symptoms nor child cortisol levels. To conclude, intrauterine exposure to elevated cortisol levels was associated with higher ratings on offspring psychopathology at nine years of age.

"26386294","Parenting begets parenting: A neurobiological perspective on early adversity and the transmission of parenting styles across generations.","A M Lomanowska, M Boivin, C Hertzman, A S Fleming","The developing brains of young children are highly sensitive to input from their social environment. Nurturing social experience during this time promotes the acquisition of social and cognitive skills and emotional competencies. However, many young children are confronted with obstacles to healthy development, including poverty, inappropriate care, and violence, and their enhanced sensitivity to the social environment means that they are highly susceptible to these adverse childhood experiences. One source of social adversity in early life can stem from parenting that is harsh, inconsistent, non-sensitive or hostile. Parenting is considered to be the cornerstone of early socio-emotional development and an adverse parenting style is associated with adjustment problems and a higher risk of developing mood and behavioral disorders. Importantly, there is a growing literature showing that an important predictor of parenting behavior is how parents, especially mothers, were parented themselves. In this review, we examine how adversity in early-life affects mothering behavior in later-life and how these effects may be perpetuated inter-generationally. Relying on studies in humans and animal models, we consider evidence for the intergenerational transmission of mothering styles. We then describe the psychological underpinnings of mothering, including responsiveness to young, executive function and affect, as well as the physiological mediators of mothering behavior, including hormones, brain regions and neurotransmitters, and we consider how development in these relevant domains may be affected by adversity experienced in early life. Finally, we explore how genes and early experience interact to predict mothering behavior, including the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms. Understanding how adverse parenting begets adverse parenting in the next generation is critical for designing interventions aimed at preventing this intergenerational cycle of early adversity.",2017,2,7,"Neuroscience","10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.09.029",NA,"Neuroscience","eng","D000818; D001921; D044127; D059647; D006801; D007858; D008425; D016487","Animals; Brain; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene-Environment Interaction; Humans; Learning; Maternal Behavior; Parenting",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Psychology, University of Toronto Mississauga, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; Fraser Mustard Institute for Human Development, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1V6, Canada."

A prior study associated species of Toxocara Stiles, 1905 with cognitive deficits in children. To determine if a similar association between toxocariasis and cognition exists in adults, we analysed a large dataset from the United States' Center for Disease Control's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We used linear-regression and multivariate models to examine the association between toxocariasis as assessed by the presence of anti-Toxocara IgG antibodies and three measures of cognitive function - simple reaction time (SRT), symbol-digit substitution (SDS) and serial-digit learning (SDL) in 4 279 adults aged 21 to 59 years. Toxocara seroprevalence did not vary with age or blood-lead concentration but did vary with gender, ethnicity, educational attainment and poverty-to-income ratio. Controlling for gender, age, blood-lead concentration, educational attainment, ethnic background and the poverty-to-income ratio, we found that toxocariasis predicted worse performance on the SDS but not on the SRT or the SDL. Moreover, there were significant interactions between toxocariasis and age, gender and educational attainment. In conclusion, toxocariasis appears to be associated with decreased cognitive function. Interactions between toxocariasis and gender, age and educational attainment further suggest that certain groups may be more susceptible than others to the cognitive dysfunction associated with toxocariasis in adults.",2015,9,7,"Folia parasitologica","10.14411/fp.2015.048",NA,"Folia Parasitol (Praha)","eng",NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Psychology, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, USA."

Accumulating clinical and pre-clinical evidence suggests that the primary motor cortex (M1) is involved in the pathophysiology of PD and that modulating cortical activity may be a therapeutic target in PD and dyskinesia. However, surprisingly little is known about how M1 neurotransmitter tone or gene expression is altered in PD, dyskinesia or associated animal models. The present study utilized the rat unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of PD/dyskinesia to characterize structural and functional changes taking place in M1 monoamine innervation and gene expression. 6-OHDA caused dopamine pathology in M1, although the lesion was less severe than in the striatum. Rats with 6-OHDA lesions showed a PD motor impairment and developed dyskinesia when given L-DOPA or the D1 receptor agonist, SKF81297. M1 expression of two immediate-early genes (c-Fos and ARC) was strongly enhanced by either L-DOPA or SKF81297. At the same time, expression of genes specifically involved in glutamate and GABA signaling were either modestly affected or unchanged by lesion and/or treatment. We conclude that M1 neurotransmission and signal transduction in the rat 6-OHDA model of PD/dyskinesia mirror features of human PD, supporting the utility of the model to study M1 dysfunction in PD and the elucidation of novel pathophysiological mechanisms and therapeutic targets.",2015,12,3,"Neuroscience","10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.09.018","PMC4633339","Neuroscience","eng","D000386; D000818; D001552; D004195; D015259; D004409; D007839; D015870; D007980; D008297; D008474; D009044; D016627; D020734; D016760; D051381; D017207; D012720; D009435","AIDS-Related Complex; Animals; Benzazepines; Disease Models, Animal; Dopamine Agents; Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced; Functional Laterality; Gene Expression; Levodopa; Male; Medial Forebrain Bundle; Motor Cortex; Oxidopamine; Parkinsonian Disorders; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Severity of Illness Index; Synaptic Transmission","F31 NS066684; R01 NS059600; F31-NS066684; R01-NS059600","NA",NA,"Behavioral Neuroscience Program, Department of Psychology, Binghamton University - State University of New York, Binghamton, NY, USA."

In this study, we used an fMRI affective face processing task to compare a large group (n=70) of 14-year olds with a history of cannabis use to a group (n=70) of never-using controls matched on numerous characteristics including IQ, SES, alcohol and cigarette use. The task contained short movies displaying angry and neutral faces. Results indicated that cannabis users had greater reactivity in the bilateral amygdalae to angry faces than neutral faces, an effect that was not observed in their abstinent peers. In contrast, activity levels in the cannabis users in cortical areas including the right temporal-parietal junction and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex did not discriminate between the two face conditions, but did differ in controls. Results did not change after excluding subjects with any psychiatric symptomology. Given the high density of cannabinoid receptors in the amygdala, our findings suggest cannabis use in early adolescence is associated with hypersensitivity to signals of threat.

We examined whether somatosensory electrical stimulation (SES) added to motor practice (MP) could augment motor learning, interlimb transfer, and whether physiological changes in neuronal excitability underlie these changes. Participants (18-30 years, n = 31) received MP, SES, MP + SES, or a control intervention. Visuomotor practice included 300 trials for 25 min with the right-dominant wrist and SES consisted of weak electrical stimulation of the radial and median nerves above the elbow. Single- and double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) metrics were measured in the intervention and non-intervention extensor carpi radialis. There was 27 % motor learning and 9 % (both p &lt; 0.001) interlimb transfer in all groups but SES added to MP did not augment learning and transfer. Corticospinal excitability increased after MP and SES when measured at rest but it increased after MP and decreased after SES when measured during contraction. No changes occurred in intracortical inhibition and facilitation. MP did not affect the TMS metrics in the transfer hand. In contrast, corticospinal excitability strongly increased after SES with MP + SES showing sharply opposite of these effects. Motor practice and SES each can produce motor learning and interlimb transfer and are likely to be mediated by different mechanisms. The results provide insight into the physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of MP and SES on motor learning and cortical plasticity and show that these mechanisms are likely to be different for the trained and stimulated motor cortex and the non-trained and non-stimulated motor cortex.",2015,12,1,"European journal of applied physiology","10.1007/s00421-015-3248-z","PMC4635177","Eur J Appl Physiol","eng","D000293; D000328; D019054; D005073; D005260; D006801; D007858; D008297; D009044; D009048; D009473; D011712; D050781; D004561; D014953","Adolescent; Adult; Evoked Potentials, Motor; Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Motor Cortex; Motor Skills; Neuronal Plasticity; Pyramidal Tracts; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation; Wrist",NA,"10.1093/brain/114.6.2465; 10.1016/j.cub.2004.01.033; 10.1177/1545968305274517; 10.1016/j.apmr.2007.11.021; 10.1002/hbm.20559; 10.1073/pnas.97.7.3661; 10.1016/j.clinph.2009.08.013; 10.1152/japplphysiol.01351.2007; 10.1016/j.apmr.2007.08.001; 10.1016/S0022-510X(02)00443-4; 10.1016/j.apmr.2011.01.011; 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2011.07870.x; 10.1007/s00415-006-0364-z; 10.1016/j.neuron.2011.10.008; 10.1097/00001756-200203040-00023; 10.1016/S0306-4522(98)00451-5; 10.1152/jn.00717.2004; 10.1007/BF00239597; 10.1007/s00421-008-0871-y; 10.1007/s00221-008-1620-5; 10.1152/jn.00595.2003; 10.1016/S1388-2457(01)00581-8; 10.1007/PL00005612; 10.1113/jphysiol.2009.175885; 10.1212/WNL.62.12.2262; 10.1038/264; 10.1016/0013-4694(84)90126-3; 10.1016/0306-4522(90)90210-U; 10.1097/WNR.0000000000000248; 10.1249/MSS.0b013e31820a94b8; 10.1002/hbm.21191; 10.1080/00222895.2012.654522; 10.1152/japplphysiol.01408.2004; 10.1002/cne.901810206; 10.1016/j.cub.2012.01.024; 10.1113/jphysiol.2001.012801; 10.1002/cne.903450203; 10.1136/jnnp.2008.161117; 10.1113/jphysiol.1993.sp019912; 10.1113/jphysiol.2009.183855; 10.1007/s00221-011-2556-8; 10.1002/jnr.20733; 10.1097/00001756-200207190-00011; 10.1007/s002210000614; 10.1038/nature712; 10.1016/j.brs.2014.09.010; 10.1152/japplphysiol.01073.2003; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5364-11.2012; 10.1016/S0028-3908(99)00254-3; 10.1016/0028-3932(71)90067-4; 10.1016/0168-5597(92)90097-U; 10.1007/s00221-004-1947-5; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4128-06.2007; 10.1152/jn.00322.2013; 10.1111/apha.12032; 10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.00623.x; 10.1016/S1388-2457(01)00592-2; 10.1007/BF00816162; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0120-12.2012; 10.1016/j.clinph.2009.08.016; 10.1093/brain/105.3.515; 10.3389/fnhum.2013.00397; 10.1161/01.STR.0000195130.16843.ac; 10.1371/journal.pone.0051298; 10.1007/s11065-010-9130-1; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.10.005; 10.3200/JMBR.39.1.29-39; 10.1097/WNR.0b013e3283439511; 10.1016/j.humov.2010.02.006; 10.1093/cercor/bhu043; 10.1007/s00421-010-1521-8; 10.1002/pri.515; 10.1093/brain/123.3.572; 10.1016/j.bbr.2012.10.053; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.07.013; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.05.055; 10.1016/j.apmr.2005.11.019; 10.1002/ana.410400306; 10.1093/brain/124.6.1171",NA,"Center for Human Movement Sciences, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, 9713AV FA23, Groningen, The Netherlands."

Accumulating evidence suggests that this may be due, in part, to the association between lower childhood SES and higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Drawing from literature showing that low childhood SES predicts exaggerated physiological reactivity to stressors and that lower SES is associated with a more communal, socially attuned orientation, we hypothesized that inflammatory reactivity would be more greatly affected by cues of social support among individuals whose childhood SES was low than among those whose childhood SES was high. In two studies, we found that individuals with lower subjective childhood SES exhibited greater reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokine reactivity to a stressor in the presence of a supportive figure (relative to conditions with an unsupportive or neutral figure). These effects were independent of current SES.

"26262878","Developmental Trajectories of Internally and Externally Driven Temporal Prediction.","Giovanni Mento, Vincenza Tarantino","The ability to generate temporal prediction (TP) is fundamental to our survival since it allows us to selectively orient our attention in time in order to prioritize relevant environmental information. Studies on adult participants showed that externally and internally driven mechanisms can be engaged to establish TP, both resulting in better behavioural performance. However, few studies on children have investigated the ability to engage internally and externally driven TP, especially in relation to how these mechanisms change across development. In this study, 111 participants (88 children between six and eleven years of age, and 23 adults) were tested by means of a simple reaction time paradigm, in which temporal cueing and neutral conditions were orthogonally manipulated to induce externally and internally driven TP mechanisms, as well as an interaction between the two. Sequential effects (SEs) relative to both tasks were also investigated. Results showed that all children participating in the study were able to implement both external and internal TP in an independent fashion. However, children younger than eight years were not able to combine both strategies. Furthermore, in the temporal cueing blocks they did not show the typically-observed asymmetric SE pattern. These results suggest that children can flexibly use both external and internal TP mechanisms to optimise their behaviour, although their successful combined use develops only after eight years of age.",2015,1,1,"PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0135098","PMC4532408","PLoS One","eng","D000328; D001288; D002648; D003463; D004328; D006801; D008875; D010775; D011930","Adult; Attention; Child; Cues; Drive; Humans; Middle Aged; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time",NA,"10.1162/jocn_a_00715; 10.1007/s00221-005-0131-x; 10.1016/j.cognition.2012.02.005; 10.1006/cogp.2000.0738; 10.1371/journal.pone.0062896; 10.3389/fnhum.2013.00827; 10.1371/journal.pone.0014620; 10.1152/jn.90656.2008; 10.1016/j.conb.2008.07.011; 10.1037/a0019956; 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000166; 10.1016/j.conb.2007.07.006; 10.1016/j.actpsy.2008.08.005; 10.1016/j.cognition.2014.09.002; 10.1162/jocn.2009.21098; 10.1093/cercor/bhj163; 10.2466/pms.1989.68.3.931; 10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00308; 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.10.005; 10.1016/j.cognition.2013.10.006; 10.1016/j.cogbrainres.2004.04.007; 10.1162/jocn.2008.20016; 10.1111/1467-9280.00484; 10.1121/1.3050254; 10.1371/journal.pone.0123625; 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00327; 10.3969/j.issn.1002-0829.2014.02.009; 10.1167/14.4.8; 10.1016/j.jecp.2004.10.003; 10.1016/j.cogbrainres.2003.09.003; 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.09.014; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.09.038; 10.1162/jocn_a_00030; 10.1126/science.1091573","<b>Competing Interests: </b>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Department of General Psychology, University of Padua, Via Venezia 8, 35131, Padua, Italy; Department of Neurosciences: SNPSRR, University of Padua, Via Giustiniani 5, 35128, Padova (PD), Italy."

Specifically, we reviewed a total of 2921 abstracts published within the following journals between 2003 and 2013: Language, Speech, and Hearing Services in Schools (LSHSS); American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology (AJSLP); Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research (JSLHR); Journal of Communication Disorders (JCD); and the International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders (IJLCD). Of the 346 eligible articles that addressed causal factors on child language development across the five journals, 11% were categorized as Genetic (37/346), 83% (287/346) were categorized as Environmental, and 6% (22/346) were categorized as Mixed. The bulk of studies addressing environmental influences focused on therapist intervention (154/296=52%), family/caregiver linguistic input (65/296=22%), or family/caregiver qualities (39/296=13%). A more in-depth review of all eligible studies published in 2013 (n=34) revealed that family/caregiver qualities served as the most commonly controlled environmental factor (e.g., SES) and only 3 studies explicitly noted the possibility of gene-environment interplay. This review highlighted the need to expand the research base for the field of CSD to include a broader range of environmental influences on child language development (e.g., diet, toxin exposure, stress) and to consider more directly the complex and dynamic interplay between genetic and environmental effects.

However, screening of impairments is a significant challenge in low-resource countries. We adapted and validated the rapid neurodevelopmental assessment (RNDA) instrument developed in Bangladesh to assess impairment in nine domains: primitive reflexes, gross and fine motor development, vision, hearing, speech, cognition, behaviour and seizures. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 77 infants (0-12&#x2009;months) in rural Guatemala in July 2012 and July 2013. We assessed inter-rater reliability and predictive validity between the 27-item RNDA and the 325-item Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III) and concurrent validity based on chronic malnutrition, a condition associated with neurodevelopmental impairments. For both RNDA and BSID-III, standardized scores below 80 were defined as borderline impairment. Children came from rural households (92%), were born to indigenous women of Mayan descent (73%) and had moderate or severe growth stunting (43%). Inter-rater reliability for eight RNDA domains was of moderate to high reliability (weighted &#x3ba; coefficients, 0.49-0.99). Children screened positive for impairment in fine motor (17%) and gross motor (14%) domains using the RNDA. The RNDA had good concurrent ability; infants who were growth stunted had higher mean levels of impairment in gross motor, speech and cognition domains (all p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).

Through partnerships with community organizations, we implemented an innovative pilot 10-week cognitive training intervention. Noncomputerized games were used to combine social interaction and cognitive training that challenged attentional and memory function for 1 hour each week over the span of 10 weeks. One game used in the intervention program was created by adapting a working memory training task into a fun and competitive card game; the other two games were commercially available. The intervention and pre/post assessments were able to be delivered in a community setting. Overall retention was satisfactory, but it dropped in later weeks of the intervention. Older adult participants reported enjoying the games and being invested in their performance. They also reported playing the games with family and friends at home. Older adult participants complied with game rules but were reluctant to comply with instructions to rotate game partners and game types. They preferred their first partners, and they preferred the card game over the existing commercial games. This intervention has the potential to improve quality of life and reduce disparities in cognitive health in older adults because it is an accessible game-based intervention program that motivates older adult participants to engage cognitively and to continue this engagement beyond the formal training sessions. However, in order to carry this out on a larger scale, particular attention must be paid to recruitment, retention, and training procedures.

"26192216","Association of Child Poverty, Brain Development, and Academic Achievement.","Nicole L Hair, Jamie L Hanson, Barbara L Wolfe, Seth D Pollak","Children living in poverty generally perform poorly in school, with markedly lower standardized test scores and lower educational attainment. The longer children live in poverty, the greater their academic deficits. These patterns persist to adulthood, contributing to lifetime-reduced occupational attainment. To determine whether atypical patterns of structural brain development mediate the relationship between household poverty and impaired academic performance. Longitudinal cohort study analyzing 823 magnetic resonance imaging scans of 389 typically developing children and adolescents aged 4 to 22 years from the National Institutes of Health Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of Normal Brain Development with complete sociodemographic and neuroimaging data. Data collection began in November 2001 and ended in August 2007. Participants were screened for a variety of factors suspected to adversely affect brain development, recruited at 6 data collection sites across the United States, assessed at baseline, and followed up at 24-month intervals for a total of 3 periods. Each study center used community-based sampling to reflect regional and overall US demographics of income, race, and ethnicity based on the US Department of Housing and Urban Development definitions of area income. One-quarter of sample households reported the total family income below 200% of the federal poverty level. Repeated observations were available for 301 participants. Household poverty measured by family income and adjusted for family size as a percentage of the federal poverty level. Children's scores on cognitive and academic achievement assessments and brain tissue, including gray matter of the total brain, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and hippocampus. Poverty is tied to structural differences in several areas of the brain associated with school readiness skills, with the largest influence observed among children from the poorest households. Regional gray matter volumes of children below 1.5 times the federal poverty level were 3 to 4 percentage points below the developmental norm (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.05). A larger gap of 8 to 10 percentage points was observed for children below the federal poverty level (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.05). These developmental differences had consequences for children's academic achievement. On average, children from low-income households scored 4 to 7 points lower on standardized tests (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.05). As much as 20% of the gap in test scores could be explained by maturational lags in the frontal and temporal lobes. The influence of poverty on children's learning and achievement is mediated by structural brain development. To avoid long-term costs of impaired academic functioning, households below 150% of the federal poverty level should be targeted for additional resources aimed at remediating early childhood environments.",2015,9,1,"JAMA pediatrics","10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.1475","PMC4687959","JAMA Pediatr","eng","D000293; D001921; D002648; D002657; D002675; D004522; D005191; D005260; D054624; D006801; D008137; D008279; D008297; D009483; D011203; D012923; D012959; D014481; D055815","Adolescent; Brain; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Educational Status; Family Characteristics; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Poverty; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; Young Adult","N01-HD02-3343; N01-MH9-0002; N01-NS-9-2314; N01-NS-9-2319; N01-NS-9-2315; N01 HD023343; R01 MH061285; P2C HD047873; N01-NS-9-2317; N01-NS-9-2316; N01-NS-9-2320","NA","<b>Conflict of Interest Disclosures:</b> None reported.","Department of Psychology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison7Waisman Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison."

We sought to determine 1) whether a brief intervention teaching residents about IHELP, a social needs screening tool, could improve resident screening, and 2) how accurately IHELP could detect needs in the inpatient setting. During an 18-month period, interns rotating on 1 of 2 otherwise identical inpatient general pediatrics teams were trained in IHELP. Interns on the other team served as the comparison group. Every admission history and physical examination (H&amp;P) was reviewed for IHELP screening. Social work evaluations were used to establish the sensitivity and specificity of IHELP and document resources provided to families with active needs. During a 21-month postintervention period, every third H&amp;P was reviewed to determine median duration of continued IHELP use. A total of 619 admissions met inclusion criteria. Over 80% of intervention team H&amp;Ps documented use of IHELP. The percentage of social work consults was nearly 3 times greater on the intervention team than on the comparison team (P &lt; .001). Among H&amp;Ps with documented use of IHELP, specificity was 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.87-0.99) and sensitivity was 0.63 (95% confidence interval 0.50-0.73). Social work provided resources for 78% of positively screened families. The median duration of screening use by residents after the intervention was 8.1 months (interquartile range 1-10 months).

In this Opinion, we present the rationale for promulgating an ""Essential Diagnostics List."" Additionally, we explain the ways in which adopting a vision for ""Health in All Policies"" could link essential diagnostics with robust and timely societal outcomes such as sustainable development, human rights, gender parity, and alleviation of poverty. We do so in three ways. First, we propose the need for a new, ""see through"" taxonomy for knowledge-based innovation as we transition from the material industries (e.g., textiles, plastic, cement, glass) dominant in the 20(th) century to the anticipated knowledge industry of the 21st century. If knowledge is the currency of the present century, then it is sensible to adopt an approach that thoroughly examines scientific knowledge, starting with the production aims, methods, quality, distribution, access, and the ends it purports to serve. Second, we explain that this knowledge trajectory focus on innovation is crucial and applicable across all sectors, including public, private, or public-private partnerships, as it underscores the fact that scientific knowledge is a co-product of technology, human values, and social systems. By making the value systems embedded in scientific design and knowledge co-production transparent, we all stand to benefit from sustainable and transparent science. Third, we appeal to the global health community to consider the necessary qualities of good governance for 21st century organizations that will embark on developing essential diagnostics. These have importance not only for science and knowledge-based innovation, but also for the ways in which we can build open, healthy, and peaceful civil societies today and for future generations.",2015,8,1,"Omics : a journal of integrative biology","10.1089/omi.2015.0075",NA,"OMICS","eng","D015415; D003954; D014943; D007722; D006801; D025202; D009936; D010597; D011634","Biomarkers; Diagnostic Services; Global Health; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Organizational Innovation; Pharmacogenetics; Public Health",NA,"NA",NA,"9 Office of the President, Gaziantep University , Gaziantep, Turkey ."

We utilised data collected by the 10/66 research group to investigate the lifetime prevalence of head injury in defined sites in low and middle income countries, its risk factors and its relationship with disability. We analysed data from one-phase cross-sectional surveys of all residents aged 65 years and older (n = 16430) distributed across twelve sites in eight low and middle income countries (China, Cuba, Dominican Republic, India, Venezuela, Mexico, Peru, and Puerto Rico). Self-reported cases of head injury with loss of consciousness were identified during the interview. A sensitivity analysis including data provided by informants of people with dementia was also used to estimate the impact of this information on the estimates. Prevalence ratios (PR) from Poisson regressions were used to identify associated risk factors. The standardised lifetime prevalence of TBI ranged from 0.3% in China to 14.6% in rural Mexico and Venezuela. Being male (PR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.29-1.82), younger (PR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.99), with lower education (PR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.86-0.96), and having fewer assets (PR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88-0.96), was associated with a higher prevalence of TBI when pooling estimates across sites.

The purpose of this study was to systematically review factors influencing dietary and physical activity behaviors to guide health promotion interventions and provide recommendations for future studies. We conducted a systematic literature review to identify relevant articles. Searches were conducted between May 2014 and July 2014, and inclusive of articles published up until July 2014. Articles were searched using four databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, SocINDEX, and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection. Eligible studies focused on diet and/or physical activity or determinants of diet and/or physical activity in Canadian Inuit population, and were published in English. A total of 45 articles were included in the analysis. A detailed appraisal of the articles suggested that many Inuit have disconnected from the traditional ways of life, including harvesting and processing of traditional food species and the associated physical activity. In the last two decades there has been a significant shift from consumption of healthy traditional foods to energy-dense store-bought foods particularly among younger Inuit (&lt;50 years of age). Additionally, low socioeconomic status (SES) and high transportation cost affect food accessibility and contribute to poor dietary choices in the population. However, a few articles that described the mediating role of psychosocial factors reported that higher SES, increased healthful food knowledge, and self-efficacy towards healthy dietary behavior, were associated with greater intentions to make healthier food choices and participate in physical activity. It is evident that the rapid social, cultural, and environmental changes in the Arctic have altered dietary and physical activity behaviors of Canadian Inuit. However, our understanding is limited on how these behaviours might be influenced in the face of these changes. Prospective studies are needed to advance our knowledge of cognitive and environmental determinants of Inuit energy balance-related behaviours.

"26094025","Integrating mental health into primary care in Nigeria: report of a demonstration project using the mental health gap action programme intervention guide.","Oye Gureje, Jibril Abdulmalik, Lola Kola, Emmanuel Musa, Mohammad Taghi Yasamy, Kazeem Adebayo","The World Mental Health Surveys conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) have shown that huge treatment gaps for severe mental disorders exist in both developed and developing countries. This gap is greatest in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Efforts to scale up mental health services in LMICs have to contend with the paucity of mental health professionals and health facilities providing specialist services for mental, neurological and substance use (MNS) disorders. A pragmatic solution is to improve access to care through the facilities that exist closest to the community, via a task-shifting strategy. This study describes a pilot implementation program to integrate mental health services into primary health care in Nigeria. The program was implemented over 18 months in 8 selected local government areas (LGAs) in Osun state of Nigeria, using the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG), which had been contextualized for the local setting. A well supervised cascade training model was utilized, with Master Trainers providing training for the Facilitators, who in turn conducted several rounds of training for front-line primary health care workers. The first set of trainings by the Facilitators was supervised and mentored by the Master Trainers and refresher trainings were provided after 9 months. A total of 198 primary care workers, from 68 primary care clinics, drawn from 8 LGAs with a combined population of 966,714 were trained in the detection and management of four MNS conditions: moderate to severe major depression, psychosis, epilepsy, and alcohol use disorders, using the mhGAP-IG. Following training, there was a marked improvement in the knowledge and skills of the health workers and there was also a significant increase in the numbers of persons identified and treated for MNS disorders, and in the number of referrals. Even though substantial retention of gained knowledge was observed nine months after the initial training, some level of decay had occurred supporting the need for a refresher training. It is feasible to scale up mental health services in primary care settings in Nigeria, using the mhGAP-IG and a well-supervised cascade-training model. This format of training is pragmatic, cost-effective and holds promise, especially in settings where there are few specialists.",2015,6,21,"BMC health services research","10.1186/s12913-015-0911-3","PMC4475323","BMC Health Serv Res","eng","D000328; D003362; D019033; D003865; D003906; D005260; D006282; D006801; D008297; D008605; D009549; D010865; D011203; D011320; D012017; D019966","Adult; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Depressive Disorder, Major; Developing Countries; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Mental Health Services; Nigeria; Pilot Projects; Poverty; Primary Health Care; Referral and Consultation; Substance-Related Disorders",NA,"10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61414-7; 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2008.01693.x; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61729-2; 10.1192/bjp.186.5.436; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61263-X; 10.4314/ajpsy.v13i2.54359; 10.1186/1752-4458-5-8; 10.1186/1472-6963-13-368; 10.3109/09540261.2010.536152; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61239-2; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001501; 10.1016/S0033-3182(00)71172-8; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001225",NA,"Department of Psychiatry, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Nigeria."

BMI and leptin relationships were significantly different in low versus high PM2.5 exposed children. Mexico City APOE 4 versus 3 children had higher glucose (p=0.009). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D&lt;30 ng/mL was documented in 87% of Mexico City children. Leptin is strongly positively associated to PM 2.5 cumulative exposures. Residing in a high PM2.5 and O3 environment is associated with 12h fasting hyperleptinemia, altered appetite-regulating peptides, vitamin D deficiency, and increases in ET-1 in clinically healthy children. These changes could signal the future trajectory of urban children towards the development of insulin resistance, obesity, type II diabetes, premature cardiovascular disease, addiction-like behavior, cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Increased efforts should be made to decrease pediatric PM2.5 exposures, to deliver health interventions prior to the development of obesity and to identify and mitigate environmental factors influencing obesity and Alzheimer disease.",2015,7,1,"Environmental research","10.1016/j.envres.2015.05.012",NA,"Environ Res","eng","D000293; D000544; D001835; D016022; D002648; D015331; D019332; D006728; D006801; D020738; D008800; D009765; D052638; D014808","Adolescent; Alzheimer Disease; Body Weight; Case-Control Studies; Child; Cohort Studies; Endothelin-1; Hormones; Humans; Leptin; Mexico; Obesity; Particulate Matter; Vitamin D Deficiency","G12-MD007591","NA",NA,"College of Sciences, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA."

Experimental evidence from animal models and correlational studies in humans support the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to high levels of glucocorticoids can negatively affect the developing fetus and later emotional and behavioral regulation in the offspring. In this integrative review, recent findings from research in psychiatry, obstetrics, and animal and human experimental studies on the role of docosahexaenoic acid in modulation of the stress response and brain development are discussed. The potential for an emerging field of nutritionally based perinatal preventive interventions for improving offspring mental health is described.

"25972822","The developmental onset of symbolic approximation: beyond nonsymbolic representations, the language of numbers matters.","Iro Xenidou-Dervou, Camilla Gilmore, Menno van der Schoot, Ernest C D M van Lieshout","Symbolic (i.e., with Arabic numerals) approximate arithmetic with large numerosities is an important predictor of mathematics. It was previously evidenced to onset before formal schooling at the kindergarten age (Gilmore et al., 2007) and was assumed to map onto pre-existing nonsymbolic (i.e., abstract magnitudes) representations. With a longitudinal study (Experiment 1), we show, for the first time, that nonsymbolic and symbolic arithmetic demonstrate different developmental trajectories. In contrast to Gilmore et al.'s (2007) findings, Experiment 1 showed that symbolic arithmetic onsets in grade 1, with the start of formal schooling, not earlier. Gilmore et al. (2007) had examined English-speaking children, whereas we assessed a large Dutch-speaking sample. The Dutch language for numbers can be cognitively more demanding, for example, due to the inversion property in numbers above 20. Thus, for instance, the number 48 is named in Dutch ""achtenveertig"" (eight and forty) instead of ""forty eight."" To examine the effect of the language of numbers, we conducted a cross-cultural study with English- and Dutch-speaking children that had similar SES and math achievement skills (Experiment 2). Results demonstrated that Dutch-speaking kindergarteners lagged behind English-speaking children in symbolic arithmetic, not nonsymbolic and demonstrated a working memory overload in symbolic arithmetic, not nonsymbolic. Also, we show for the first time that the ability to name two-digit numbers highly correlates with symbolic approximate arithmetic not nonsymbolic. Our experiments empirically demonstrate that the symbolic number system is modulated more by development and education than the nonsymbolic system. Also, in contrast to the nonsymbolic system, the symbolic system is modulated by language.",2015,1,1,"Frontiers in psychology","10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00487","PMC4413728","Front Psychol","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.jecp.2003.10.002; 10.1080/713755608; 10.1146/annurev-psych-120710-100422; 10.1027//1016-9040.7.2.85; 10.1016/j.jecp.2013.08.010; 10.1037/a0013046; 10.1016/j.cognition.2004.09.011; 10.1073/pnas.0505512102; 10.1037/0012-1649.41.6.189; 10.1073/pnas.1201893109; 10.1162/001152604772746701; 10.1016/j.jecp.2012.02.005; 10.1016/j.tine.2013.12.001; 10.1016/S0166-2236(98)01263-6; 10.1016/j.tine.2013.06.001; 10.1016/j.tics.2004.05.002; 10.1111/cdep.12019; 10.1016/j.cognition.2004.09.004; 10.1371/journal.pone.0054651; 10.1016/j.lindif.2013.10.004; 10.1038/nature05850; 10.1016/j.cognition.2010.02.002; 10.1016/j.jecp.2013.10.001; 10.1177/0956797613516471; 10.1177/0022022111406251; 10.1037/a0012682; 10.1177/0022022111406026; 10.1016/j.jecp.2008.04.001; 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00272; 10.1016/j.cognition.2007.06.004; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02031.x; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01508.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2011.01080.x; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2005.00891.x; 10.1111/desc.12152; 10.1371/journal.pone.0023749; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01969.x; 10.1016/j.cogdev.2010.08.010; 10.1016/j.jecp.2009.02.003; 10.1016/j.bandl.2004.06.107; 10.1126/science.1102085; 10.1016/j.ridd.2011.06.004; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.12.061; 10.1080/17470218.2013.803581; 10.1073/pnas.1302751110; 10.1044/1092-4388(2009/07-0144); 10.1016/j.lindif.2013.09.012; 10.1111/cogs.12053; 10.1016/j.jecp.2008.04.003",NA,"Department of Educational Neuroscience and LEARN!

The interplay of caregiving consequences: poverty, discrimination and stigma, lack of support from others, diminished social relationships, depression, emotional trauma, and poor or interrupted sleep are associated caregiver burden. The burden of care on caregivers of people living with MDs was assessed in two districts located in the middle part of Ghana. Coping strategies and available support for caregivers of MDs were also assessed. A qualitative study was carried out involving 75 caregivers of participants with MDs registered within the Kintampo Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems. Data were gathered from caregivers about their experiences in providing care for their relations with MDs. Caregivers reported various degrees of burden, which included financial, social exclusion, emotional, depression, and inadequate time for other social responsibilities. Responsibilities around caregiving were mostly shared among close relatives but to a varying and limited extent. Religious prayers and the anticipation of cure were the main coping strategies adopted by caregivers, with expectation of new treatments being discovered. Emotional distress, stigma, financial burden, lack of support networks, social exclusion, health impact, and absence of decentralised mental health services were experienced by family caregivers. These findings highlight the need for interventions to support people with MDs and their caregivers. This might include policy development and implementation that will decentralise mental health care provision including psychosocial support for caregivers. This will ameliorate families' financial and emotional burden, facilitate early diagnosis and management, reduce travel time to seek care, and improve the quality of life of family caregivers of persons with MDs.",2015,1,1,"Global health action","10.3402/gha.v8.26957","PMC4429259","Glob Health Action","eng","D000223; D000293; D000328; D000368; D017028; D005190; D005260; D005869; D006801; D007407; D008297; D001523; D008875; D011788; D012424; D012944; D013315; D013997; D055815","Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Caregivers; Family; Female; Ghana; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Rural Population; Social Support; Stress, Psychological; Time Factors; Young Adult",NA,"NA",NA,"Kintampo Health Research Centre, Ghana Health Service, Kintampo, Ghana."

This mortality gap is driven by natural deaths; cardiovascular disease is a major cause, but outcomes for people with severe mental illness are worse for many physical health conditions, including cancer, fractures and complications of surgery. We set out to examine the literature on disparities in medical and dental care experienced by people with schizophrenia and suggest possible approaches to improving health. This narrative review used a targeted literature search to identify the literature on physical health disparities in schizophrenia. There is evidence of inequitable access to and/or uptake of physical and dental health care by those with schizophrenia. The goal was to reduce the mortality gap through equity of access to all levels of health care, including acute care, long-term condition management, preventative medicine and health promotion. We suggest solutions to promote health, wellbeing and longevity in this population, prioritising identification of and intervention for risk factors for premature morbidity and mortality.

"25948868","Specific electrophysiological components disentangle affective sharing and empathic concern in psychopathy.","Jean Decety, Kimberly L Lewis, Jason M Cowell","Empathic impairment is one of the hallmarks of psychopathy, a personality dimension associated with poverty in affective reactions, lack of attachment to others, and a callous disregard for the feelings, rights, and welfare of others. Neuroscience research on the relation between empathy and psychopathy has predominately focused on the affective sharing and cognitive components of empathy in forensic populations, and much less on empathic concern. The current study used high-density electroencephalography in a community sample to examine the spatiotemporal neurodynamic responses when viewing people in physical distress under two subjective contexts: one evoking affective sharing, the other, empathic concern. Results indicate that early automatic (175-275 ms) and later controlled responses (LPP 400-1,000 ms) were differentially modulated by engagement in affective sharing or empathic concern. Importantly, the late event-related potentials (ERP) component was significantly impacted by dispositional empathy and psychopathy, but the early component was not. Individual differences in dispositional empathic concern directly predicted gamma coherence (25-40 Hz), whereas psychopathy was inversely modulatory. Interestingly, significant suppression in the mu/alpha band (8-13 Hz) when perceiving others in distress was positively associated with higher trait psychopathy, which argues against the assumption that sensorimotor resonance underpins empathy. Greater scores on trait psychopathy were inversely related to subjective ratings of both empathic concern and affective sharing. Overall, the study demonstrates that neural markers of affective sharing and empathic concern to the same cues of another's distress can be distinguished at an electrophysiological level, and that psychopathy alters later time-locked differentiations and spectral coherence associated with empathic concern.",2015,7,1,"Journal of neurophysiology","10.1152/jn.00253.2015","PMC4509400","J Neurophysiol","eng","D000987; D001921; D004569; D004644; D004645; D005071; D005260; D006801; D008297; D009483; D058748; D010556; D012938; D014796; D055815","Antisocial Personality Disorder; Brain; Electroencephalography; Emotions; Empathy; Evoked Potentials; Female; Humans; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Pain Perception; Personality Tests; Social Perception; Visual Perception; Young Adult","R01-MH-084934; R01-MH-087525","10.1080/17470919.2015.1029593",NA,"Child Neurosuite, Department of Psychology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois; and."

In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), SEs are highly enriched for the core pluripotency factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog. In this study, we sought to dissect the molecular control mechanism of SE activity in pluripotency and reprogramming. Starting from a protein interaction network surrounding Sox2, we identified Tex10 as a key pluripotency factor that plays a functionally significant role in ESC self-renewal, early embryo development, and reprogramming. Tex10 is enriched at SEs in a Sox2-dependent manner and coordinates histone acetylation and DNA demethylation at SEs. Tex10 activity is also important for pluripotency and reprogramming in human cells.

We used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n=13,040), a nationally representative study of U.S. adolescents in grades 7-12 during the 1994-1995 school year. Young adult outcomes (i.e., educational attainment, employment status, income, occupation, and subjective SES) were measured in Wave IV (2008 for those aged 24-33 years). Multivariate methods controlled for sociodemographic characteristics and other relevant variables. Nearly 12% of this sample presented with a physical or cognitive disability. Respondents with physical disabilities had lower educational attainment (odds ratio [OR] = 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57, 0.85) and ranked themselves in lower positions on the subjective SES ladder (OR=0.71, 95% CI 0.57, 0.87) than those without a physical disability. Compared with individuals without disabilities, young adults with a cognitive disability also had lower educational attainment (OR=0.41, 95% CI 0.33, 0.52) and, when employed, were less likely to have a professional/managerial occupation (OR=0.50, 95% CI 0.39, 0.64).

In the research reported here, we investigated neuroanatomical correlates of this gap in adolescents (N = 58) in whom academic achievement was measured by statewide standardized testing. Cortical gray-matter volume was significantly greater in students from higher-income backgrounds (n = 35) than in students from lower-income backgrounds (n = 23), but cortical white-matter volume and total cortical surface area did not differ significantly between groups. Cortical thickness in all lobes of the brain was greater in students from higher-income than lower-income backgrounds. Greater cortical thickness, particularly in temporal and occipital lobes, was associated with better test performance. These results represent the first evidence that cortical thickness in higher- and lower-income students differs across broad swaths of the brain and that cortical thickness is related to scores on academic-achievement tests.",2015,6,1,"Psychological science","10.1177/0956797615572233","PMC4458190","Psychol Sci","eng","D000124; D000293; D041923; D001921; D000066494; D005260; D006801; D007182; D008279; D008297; D011203; D013334; D014481","Achievement; Adolescent; Adolescent Development; Brain; Cognitive Neuroscience; Female; Humans; Income; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Poverty; Students; United States","F32 HD079143; F32 MH095354; F32 HD079143-01; F32 MH095354-01","NA",NA,"Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard University."
"25885525","Conceptualizing and contextualizing functioning in people with severe mental disorders in rural Ethiopia: a qualitative study.","Kassahun Habtamu, Atalay Alem, Charlotte Hanlon","The functional outcome of people with severe mental disorders (SMD) is purported to be better in low- and middle-income countries compared to high-income countries; however, cross-cultural measures of functioning may not capture adequately the relevant functional activities in rural, non-Western settings. This study aimed to gain in-depth understanding of day-to-day functioning in a rural Ethiopian setting and the functional impairments associated with SMD. A qualitative study was carried out in the Butajira area, south Ethiopia. In-depth interviews were conducted with people with SMD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;6), religious healers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2) and psychiatric nurses (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2). Four focus group discussions were carried out with caregivers of people with SMD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;37) and one with project outreach workers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5). A thematic analysis approach was used. Participants emphasized that functional impairment in people with SMD arose not only because of the symptoms associated with the illness, but also due to poverty, social exclusion and lack of social support. Within this rural community, the ability to work productively, engage in family life, maintain self-care and fulfill social obligations were the most highly valued domains of functioning. A wide range of farming tasks were elaborated in detail and noted to be of varying levels of difficulty. Although many people with symptomatic SMD were reported to be able to carry out simple farming tasks, this was distinguished from effective farming. Gender differences were most apparent in the domains of work and family life. Impaired functioning was reported to have a critical immediate impact on survival and longer-term impacts on the lifetime opportunities of people with SMD, their caregivers and the younger generation within the family. The study indicates that tackling social exclusion and poverty is needed alongside medical treatment through contextual community based rehabilitation programs. The gendering of functional roles and the complexity of work activities in this subsistence farming community lend support to arguments for locally contextualized measures of functioning in people with SMD.",2015,3,4,"BMC psychiatry","10.1186/s12888-015-0418-9","PMC4354755","BMC Psychiatry","eng","D000203; D000328; D005002; D056344; D005260; D006801; D008297; D001523; D008875; D020380; D011569; D036301; D012424; D012648; D012944","Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Ethiopia; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Needs Assessment; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Qualitative Research; Rural Population; Self Care; Social Support","U19 MH095699; U19MH095699","10.1590/S1516-44462006000200014; 10.1093/schbul/sbm105; 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.090845; 10.4314/ajpsy.v12i3.48494; 10.1093/schbul/sbs130; 10.1017/S0264180100000904; 10.1192/bjp.178.6.506; 10.1186/1471-244X-14-150; 10.1186/1471-244X-11-165; 10.1192/bjp.191.50.s71; 10.1016/j.jad.2005.11.009; 10.1192/bjp.bp.105.013417; 10.1111/j.1399-5618.2007.00327.x; 10.1186/1745-0179-3-5; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2007.01108.x; 10.1186/1477-7525-8-51; 10.1080/165019701750419545; 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69498-1; 10.1186/1471-2458-10-390; 10.1016/S0920-9964(00)90482-1; 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; 10.1016/j.ajp.2012.06.002; 10.1007/s00127-003-0691-7; 10.1016/j.schres.2005.05.028; 10.1034/j.1600-0447.2001.00059.x; 10.1093/schbul/sbl004; 10.1176/appi.ps.52.11.1485; 10.1176/ps.2006.57.8.1110; 10.1007/s00127-002-0580-5; 10.1192/bjp.bp.107.039107; 10.1093/oxfordjournals.schbul.a033400; 10.1007/s00127-004-0763-3; 10.1097/00005053-200209000-00009; 10.1080/01612840305301; 10.1007/s00127-003-0594-7; 10.1192/bjp.bp.108.057596; 10.1192/bjp.bp.112.118018; 10.1177/1363461512447070; 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2005.03545.x; 10.1017/S0033291704003551; 10.1007/s00127-003-0601-z",NA,"Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia."

The purpose of this paper is to describe the distribution of main risk factors for NCDs by socioeconomic status (SES) among adults aged 50 years and older within a country and compare these risk factors across six lower- and upper-middle income countries. The study population in this paper draw from SAGE Wave 1 and consisted of adults aged 50-plus from China (N=13,157), Ghana (N=4,305), India (N=6,560), Mexico (N=2,318), the Russian Federation (N=3,938) and South Africa (N=3,836). Seven main common risk factors for NCDs were identified: daily tobacco use, frequent heavy drinking, low level physical activity, insufficient vegetable and fruit intake, high risk waist-hip ratio, obesity and hypertension. Multiple risk factors were also calculated by summing all these risk factors. The prevalence of daily tobacco use ranged from 7.7% (Ghana) to 46.9% (India), frequent heavy drinker was the highest in China (6.3%) and lowest in India (0.2%), and the highest prevalence of low physical activity was in South Africa (59.7%). The highest prevalence of respondents with high waist-to-hip ratio risk was 84.5% in Mexico, and the prevalence of self-reported hypertension ranging from 33% (India) to 78% (South Africa). Obesity was more common in South Africa, the Russia Federation and Mexico (45.2%, 36% and 28.6%, respectively) compared with China, India and Ghana (15.3%, 9.7% and 6.4%, respectively). China, Ghana and India had a higher prevalence of respondents with multiple risk factors than Mexico, the Russia Federation and South Africa. The occurrence of three and four risk factors was more prevalent in Mexico, the Russia Federation and South Africa. There were substantial variations across countries and settings, even between upper-middle income countries and lower-middle income countries.

We wished to reassess patients with this diagnosis at our own institution and also revisit the literature to provide an overview of this condition. Clinical documentation and videos of 3 patients diagnosed with OS in the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (London, UK) were reviewed. One of the patients was clinically reappraised. A systematic review of published articles with sufficient clinical patient information was also conducted. Our 3 cases were male with symptom onset in adolescence or early adulthood. Motor slowness with poverty of movement and a history of obsessive-compulsive symptoms were characteristic. Poor speech production, bizarre postures, mannerisms, echophenomena, and oculogyric tics were also noted. Dopaminergic imaging was normal in 2 cases. One case had autistic features. Systematic literature review identified 77 further cases. Male preponderance with symptom onset mainly during the second decade and presence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms were noted. Additional motor and neuropsychiatric features were often present. The existence of OS as a ""primary"" condition is doubtful. This diagnosis has been given to characterize different clinical presentations ranging from obsessive-compulsive disorder with motor slowness resulting from covert obsessive-compulsive symptoms to catatonia.

To identify childhood predictors of ADHD outcome using both dimensional and categorical approaches. 116 adolescents and young adults with childhood ADHD were followed up on average 6.6 years later. ADHD outcome variables were interview-based parent-reported ADHD symptoms and impairment. Childhood predictors included parent- and teacher-rated ADHD symptoms and co-occurring behaviours; actigraph measures of activity level; socio-economic status (SES); and cognitive measures previously associated with ADHD. Of the sample, 79% continued to meet clinical criteria of ADHD in adolescence and young adulthood. Higher parent-rated ADHD symptoms and movement intensity in childhood, but not teacher-rated symptoms, predicted ADHD symptoms at follow up. Co-occurring symptoms of oppositional behaviours, anxiety, social and emotional problems were also significant predictors, but these effects disappeared after controlling for ADHD symptoms. IQ and SES were significant predictors of both ADHD symptoms and impairment at follow up, but no other cognitive measures significantly predicted outcome. SES and IQ emerge as potential moderators for the prognosis of ADHD. Childhood severity of ADHD symptoms, as measured by parent ratings and actigraph movement intensity, also predicts later ADHD outcome.

"25659838","Socioeconomic status and executive function: developmental trajectories and mediation.","Daniel A Hackman, Robert Gallop, Gary W Evans, Martha J Farah","Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) predicts executive function (EF), but fundamental aspects of this relation remain unknown: the developmental course of the SES disparity, its continued sensitivity to SES changes during that course, and the features of childhood experience responsible for the SES-EF relation. Regarding course, early disparities would be expected to grow during development if caused by accumulating stressors at a given constant level of SES. Alternatively, they would narrow if schooling partly compensates for the effects of earlier deprivation, allowing lower-SES children to 'catch up'. The potential for later childhood SES change to affect EF is also unknown. Regarding mediating factors, previous analyses produced mixed answers, possibly due to correlation amongst candidate mediators. We address these issues with measures of SES, working memory and planning, along with multiple candidate mediators, from the NICHD Study of Early Childcare (n = 1009). Early family income-to-needs and maternal education predicted planning by first grade, and income-to-needs predicted working memory performance at 54 months. Effects of early SES remained consistent through middle childhood, indicating that the relation between early indicators of SES and EF emerges in childhood and persists without narrowing or widening across early and middle childhood. Changes in family income-to-needs were associated with significant changes in planning and trend-level changes in working memory. Mediation analyses supported the role of early childhood home characteristics in explaining the association between SES and EF, while early childhood maternal sensitivity was specifically implicated in the association between maternal education and planning. Early emerging and persistent SES-related differences in EF, partially explained by characteristics of the home and family environment, are thus a potential source of socioeconomic disparities in achievement and health across development.",2015,9,1,"Developmental science","10.1111/desc.12246",NA,"Dev Sci","eng","D000124; D002648; D002657; D002675; D004522; D056344; D005190; D005260; D006801; D008297; D008570; D009483; D011340; D002666; D012923","Achievement; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Educational Status; Executive Function; Family; Female; Humans; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Neuropsychological Tests; Problem Solving; Psychology, Child; Social Class","R01 HD055689; R01-DA14129; T32 MH018269","NA",NA,"Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, Center for Neuroscience and Society, Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania, USA."

A total of 113 new mothers with very low-birth-weight infants in their initial NICU admission were recruited from 2 urban hospitals servicing low-income minority communities. This study employed a cross-sectional design. Data were collected during the infants' postpartum NICU admission and included maternal demographic information (eg, age, education, race, living with the baby's father), infant illness severity (Neurobiologic Risk Score from infant's medical record), and maternal psychological measures (the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the Perinatal Posttraumatic Stress Questionnaire, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory). The findings indicated that 47 (42%) women had elevated postpartum depressive symptoms and 33 (30%) women had elevated postpartum posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSs). Factors associated with postpartum depressive symptoms included PTS, anxiety, maternal age, and whether the mother lived with the baby's father (F&#x2084;, &#x2081;&#x2080;&#x2084; = 52.27, P &lt; .001). The severity of the infants' illness, parental stress, and maternal education were not associated with depressive symptoms among low-income mothers of NICU infants. On the basis of our findings, we recommend that low-income women should be screened for symptoms of anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and postpartum depression on their infants' admission to the NICU. When this is not feasible, we advise NICU healthcare providers to assess women for familial support, maternal age, posttraumatic stress related to their infants birth, and anxiety to determine which mothers are at the greatest risk for postpartum depressive symptoms. Screening for postpartum depression in the NICU can aid in early identification and treatment, thereby decreasing negative consequences for mothers and their infants.",2015,2,1,"Advances in neonatal care : official journal of the National Association of Neonatal Nurses","10.1097/ANC.0000000000000131","PMC4313576","Adv Neonatal Care","eng","D000367; D003430; D019052; D005191; D005260; D006801; D007231; D019102; D007363; D009035; D011203; D011644; D012111; D012307; D012944; D013313; D014505","Age Factors; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression, Postpartum; Family Characteristics; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Very Low Birth Weight; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Mothers; Poverty; Puerperal Disorders; Residence Characteristics; Risk Factors; Social Support; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Urban Population","F31 NR010176; R01 NR009418; NR 010176; NR 09418","NA",NA,"Women, Children, and Family Health Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago (Drs Garfield, McFarlin, and White-Traut); Research Affairs, Duke School of Nursing, Durham, North Carolina (Dr Holditch-Davis); Department of Psychiatry, Neuroscience, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (Dr Carter); Department of Biobehavioral Science, University of Illinois at Chicago (Dr Schwertz); Division of Health Promotion and Risk Reduction, University of Michigan School of Nursing, Ann Arbor (Dr Seng); College of Nursing, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan (Dr Giurgescu); and University of Illinois at Chicago, Nursing Research, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, and Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee (Dr White-Traut)."

However, whether low-income children benefit from living alongside more affluent neighbors is unknown. Prospectively gathered data on over 1,600 children from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study living in urban environments is used to test whether living alongside more affluent neighbors (measured via high-resolution geo-spatial indices) predicts low-income children's antisocial behavior (reported by mothers and teachers at the ages of 5, 7, 10, and 12). Results indicated that low-income boys (but not girls) surrounded by more affluent neighbors had higher levels of antisocial behavior than their peers embedded in concentrated poverty. The negative effect of growing up alongside more affluent neighbors on low-income boys' antisocial behavior held across childhood and after controlling for key neighborhood and family-level factors. Findings suggest that efforts to create more economically mixed communities for children, if not properly supported, may have iatrogenic effects on boys' antisocial behavior.",2015,10,1,"Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","10.1111/jcpp.12380","PMC4790437","J Child Psychol Psychiatry","eng","D002648; D002652; D002675; D004200; D004739; D005260; D006801; D008137; D008297; D011203; D012042; D012111; D012306; D012737; D012920; D012923; D014505; D014852","Child; Child Behavior; Child, Preschool; Diseases in Twins; England; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Poverty; Registries; Residence Characteristics; Risk; Sex Factors; Social Behavior Disorders; Social Class; Urban Population; Wales","G9806489; R01 HD077482; G1002190; P30 AG034424; HD061298; R01 HD061298","NA","Conflict of interest statement: No conflicts declared.","Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA."
"25596379","Proteomic analysis of individual fruit fly hemolymph.","Qi Zeng, David J Smith, Scott A Shippy","Analysis of blood proteins holds critical promise for in depth understanding of physiological states. Protein content of hemolymph from Drosophila melanogaster is of particular analytical interest because the insect open circulatory system involves chemical signaling through the hemolymph. The challenge of working with this sample, however, is the nanoliter volumes of solution available for analysis. In this study, we developed a novel hyphenated Agilent nano-HPLC chip column-MS method to obtain proteomic information from individual fruit fly hemolymph, using a low-volume sample collection technique established previously. The total amount of individual Drosophila hemolymph protein is determined around 0.798 &#xb1; 0.251 &#x3bc;g/100 nL based upon a Bradford assay with BSA. Hemolymph samples around 50 nL were collected from single flies and digested using a customized micro-scale digestion protocol. Mass spectral analysis shows a total of 19 proteins were identified from the hemolymph of individual flies. Of these findings, 6 novel proteins have been identified for the first time with evidence at the translation level. Detection of 13 proteins well-known in the literature speaks to the method's validity and demonstrates the ability to reproducibly analyze volume-limited samples from individual fruit flies for protein content. This nano-scale analysis method will facilitate future study of Drosophila and lead to a more complete understanding of the physiology of the fly model system.",2015,2,15,"Journal of chromatography.

Studies have reported an association between antidepressant use, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and bone mineral density (BMD), but the issue remains unclear. This study examined data collected from 849 Australian men (aged 24-98 years) participating in the Geelong Osteoporosis Study (GOS). Bone quality was determined using quantitative ultrasound (QUS) and included the following parameters: Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation (BUA), Speed of Sound (SOS) and Stiffness Index (SI). Anthropometry, socio-economic status (SES), medication use and lifestyle factors were determined. The cross-sectional associations between bone quality and use of antidepressants were studied using multivariate linear regression adjusted for potential confounders. At the time of assessment, 61 (7.2%) men were using antidepressants, of which 44 (72.1%) used SSRIs. Antidepressant use was associated with lower SI (p = .002), SOS (p = .010) and BUA (p = .053). However, body weight was identified as an effect modifier; QUS values were lower for antidepressant users with lower weight (&lt; 90 kg) only. Use of antidepressants was associated with lower QUS values for men with low body weights. Thus, the risk of osteoporosis should be taken into account when prescribing antidepressants, in particular among men who are in this weight category.",2015,5,1,"The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry","10.1177/0004867414565475",NA,"Aust N Z J Psychiatry","eng","D015502; D000328; D000368; D000369; D000928; D001315; D001835; D015519; D003430; D003863; D005500; D006365; D006801; D016014; D008297; D008875; D015999; D010024; D057566; D014463","Absorptiometry, Photon; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antidepressive Agents; Australia; Body Weight; Bone Density; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Follow-Up Studies; Heel; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Osteoporosis; Self Report; Ultrasonography",NA,"NA",NA,"School of Medicine, Deakin University, Geelong, Australia"
"25566109","Engagement in community music classes sparks neuroplasticity and language development in children from disadvantaged backgrounds.","Nina Kraus, Jane Hornickel, Dana L Strait, Jessica Slater, Elaine Thompson","Children from disadvantaged backgrounds often face impoverished auditory environments, such as greater exposure to ambient noise and fewer opportunities to participate in complex language interactions during development. These circumstances increase their risk for academic failure and dropout. Given the academic and neural benefits associated with musicianship, music training may be one method for providing auditory enrichment to children from disadvantaged backgrounds. We followed a group of primary-school students from gang reduction zones in Los Angeles, CA, USA for 2 years as they participated in Harmony Project. By providing free community music instruction for disadvantaged children, Harmony Project promotes the healthy development of children as learners, the development of children as ambassadors of peace and understanding, and the development of stronger communities. Children who were more engaged in the music program-as defined by better attendance and classroom participation-developed stronger brain encoding of speech after 2 years than their less-engaged peers in the program. Additionally, children who were more engaged in the program showed increases in reading scores, while those less engaged did not show improvements. The neural gains accompanying music engagement were seen in the very measures of neural speech processing that are weaker in children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Our results suggest that community music programs such as Harmony Project provide a form of auditory enrichment that counteracts some of the biological adversities of growing up in poverty, and can further support community-based interventions aimed at improving child health and wellness.",2014,1,1,"Frontiers in psychology","10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01403","PMC4268440","Front Psychol","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1377/hlthaff.21.2.60; 10.1093/cercor/bhp024; 10.1016/j.bbr.2008.08.049; 10.1002/dev.10032; 10.1111/mbe.12016; 10.1016/j.ridd.2010.12.020; 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233; 10.1073/pnas.1309518110; 10.1093/cercor/bht028; 10.1371/journal.pone.0098439; 10.1126/science.1082163; 10.1093/cercor/bhs377; 10.1162/jocn_a_00088; 10.1093/aje/kwj001; 10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00222; 10.1525/mp.2011.29.2.147; 10.1037/0894-4105.22.3.293; 10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00124; 10.2307/2112677; 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.23.112001.112349; 10.1525/mp.2008.25.4.383; 10.1371/journal.pone.0003566; 10.1093/cercor/bhs180; 10.1177/0013164406299126; 10.1162/jocn.2010.21453; 10.1016/j.bbr.2011.12.041; 10.1038/nrn2897; 10.1017/S0033291701003282; 10.1080/10632910109600008; 10.1037/0894-4105.17.3.439; 10.1111/1467-8624.00612; 10.1097/WNR.0b013e32834d2ffd; 10.1073/pnas.1206628109; 10.1016/j.bbr.2010.08.051; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4205-12.2013; 10.1016/j.cortex.2010.07.010; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5118-08.2009; 10.1162/jocn.2003.15.5.683; 10.1016/j.paid.2005.02.013; 10.3389/fnins.2014.00351; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1881-14.2014; 10.1073/pnas.0902455106; 10.1162/jocn.2006.18.2.199; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2012.06498.x; 10.1006/jevp.1999.0144; 10.1177/0956797611416999; 10.1093/cercor/bhn120; 10.1073/pnas.1304437110; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2012.01147.x; 10.1016/j.bandc.2005.05.009; 10.1196/annals.1284.060; 10.1038/33918; 10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00142; 10.1111/ejn.12049; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.01.021; 10.1097/AUD.0000000000000062; 10.1186/1744-9081-6-60; 10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x; 10.1037/0022-0663.98.2.457; 10.1196/annals.1360.015; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5315-13.2014; 10.1016/S0378-5955(03)00074-1; 10.3102/00346543075003417; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2102-13.2013; 10.1371/journal.pone.0113383; 10.1371/journal.pone.0077250; 10.1162/jocn.2008.20131; 10.1016/j.brainres.2007.10.108; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00807.x; 10.1186/1744-9081-7-44; 10.1016/j.heares.2013.08.004; 10.1093/cercor/bht103; 10.1016/j.bandl.2012.09.001; 10.1016/j.dcn.2013.06.003; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.05.078; 10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00855; 10.1016/j.amepre.2007.03.016; 10.1353/rhe.2003.0044; 10.3389/fnhum.2013.00899; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6470-10.2011; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5310-13.2014",NA,"Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory, Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, Northwestern University Evanston, IL, USA."

This study aimed to investigate the interrelationship among dietary patterns, diabetes and depression. Data were integrated from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study (2009-2010) for adults aged 18+ (n=4588, Mean age=43yr). Depressive symptoms were measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and diabetes status determined via self-report, usage of diabetic medication and/or fasting glucose levels &#x2265;126mg/dL and a glycated hemoglobin level &#x2265;6.5% (48mmol/mol). A 24-h dietary recall interview was given to determine intakes. Multiple logistic regression was employed, with depression the outcome, and dietary patterns and diabetes the predictors. Covariates included gender, age, marital status, education, race, adult food insecurity level, ratio of family income to poverty, and serum C-reactive protein. Exploratory factor analysis revealed five dietary patterns (healthy; unhealthy; sweets; 'Mexican' style; breakfast) explaining 39.8% of the total variance.

Research in high-income countries shows that risk factors in the perinatal period are significant precursors of conduct problems which can develop into violence. It is not known whether the same early influences are important in lower income settings with higher rates of violence. This study compared perinatal and sociodemographic risk factors between Brazil and Britain, and their role in explaining higher rates of conduct problems and violence in Brazil. Prospective population-based birth cohort studies were conducted in Pelotas, Brazil (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;3,618) and Avon, Britain (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;4,103). Eleven perinatal and sociodemographic risk factors were measured in questionnaires completed by mothers during the perinatal period. Conduct problems were measured in questionnaires completed by mothers at age 11, and violence in self-report questionnaires completed by adolescents at age 18. Conduct problems were predicted by similar risk factors in Brazil and Britain. Female violence was predicted by several of the same risk factors in both countries. However, male violence in Brazil was associated with only one risk factor, and several risk factor associations were weaker in Brazil than in Britain for both females and males. Almost 20% of the higher risk for conduct problems in Brazil compared to Britain was explained by differential exposure to risk factors. The percentage of the cross-national difference in violence explained by early risk factors was 15% for females and 8% for males. A nontrivial proportion of cross-national differences in antisocial behaviour are related to perinatal and sociodemographic conditions at the start of life. However, risk factor associations are weaker in Brazil than in Britain, and influences in other developmental periods are probably of particular importance for understanding male youth violence in Brazil.",2015,8,1,"Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","10.1111/jcpp.12369","PMC4508966","J Child Psychol Psychiatry","eng","D000293; D000328; D017677; D001938; D002648; D015331; D019955; D003431; D005260; D006801; D007231; D008297; D009035; D011203; D011247; D011446; D012307; D057566; D017678; D012959; D011795; D006113; D014754; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Brazil; Child; Cohort Studies; Conduct Disorder; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Mothers; Poverty; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Self Report; Sex Distribution; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom; Violence; Young Adult","092731; G0802736; 102215; MC_PC_15018; MR/L022206/1; 089963/Z/09/Z; 089963; MR/K023233/1; G0800612; 086974/Z/08/Z","NA",NA,"Postgraduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil."

Oxidants such as soluble O2 and H2O2 promote oxidation of thiols to disulfide (SS) bonded dimers affecting quantitation accuracy. The method presented here reduces disulfide-bonded species followed by fluorescence labelling of the 29.5 (&#xb1;18.2) nL hemolymph volumes of individual adult Drosophila Melanogaster. The availability of only tens of nanoliter (nL) samples that are also highly volume variant requires efficient sample handling to improve thiol measurements while minimizing sample dilution. The optimized method presented here utilizes defined lengths of capillaries to meter tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine reducing reagent and monobromobimane derivatizing reagent volumes enabling Cys and GSH quantitation with only 20-fold dilution. The nL assay developed here was optimized with respect to reagent concentrations, sample dilution, reaction times and temperatures. Separation and identification of the nL thiol mixtures were obtained with capillary electrophoresis-laser induced fluorescence. To demonstrate the capability of this method total Cys and total GSH were measured in the hemolymph collected from individual adult D. Melanogaster. The thiol measurements were used to compare a mutant fly strain with a non-functional cystine-glutamate transporter (xCT) to its background control. The mutant fly, genderblind (gb), carries a non-functional gene for a protein similar to mammalian xCT whose function is not fully understood. Average concentrations obtained for mutant and control flies are 2.19 (&#xb1;0.22) and 1.94 (&#xb1;0.34) mM Cys and 2.14 (&#xb1;0.60) and 2.08 (&#xb1;0.71) mM GSH, respectively, and are not significantly different (p&gt;0.05).

Prepubertal children (age 7-9 years; n = 126), classified as non-overweight (&lt;85th percentile body mass index [BMI]-for-age [n = 73]) or overweight/obese (&#x2265;85th percentile BMI-for-age [n = 53]), completed relational (hippocampal-dependent) and item (hippocampal-independent) memory tasks. Performance was assessed with both direct (behavioral accuracy) and indirect (preferential disproportionate viewing [PDV]) measures. Adiposity (ie, percent whole-body fat mass, subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue, and total abdominal adipose tissue) was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Backward regression identified significant (P &lt; .05) predictive models of memory performance. Covariates included age, sex, pubertal timing, socioeconomic status (SES), IQ, oxygen consumption, and BMI z-score. Among overweight/obese children, total abdominal adipose tissue was a significant negative predictor of relational memory behavioral accuracy, and pubertal timing together with SES jointly predicted the PDV measure of relational memory. In contrast, among non-overweight children, male sex predicted item memory behavioral accuracy, and a model consisting of SES and BMI z-score jointly predicted the PDV measure of relational memory.

Forty girls in the age range of 16-18 years from urban slums received messages every day for a month. They could call or message back or give a 'missed call' to the same number whenever they had emotional problems or felt like talking to a counselor. The received responses in the form of return texts, missed calls and return phone calls were recorded. Feedback about the feasibility and acceptability of the mobile messages was collected after a month. 25 out of 40 (62.5%) participants called back, asking for mental health services and to say they felt good about the messages. 23 of 40 (57.5%) messaged back regarding their feelings. 62% reported that they felt supported with the mental health messages. Male family members of nearly half of the participants called back to check the authenticity of the source. Most women did not face any problems because of the messages. This pilot qualitative study indicates that mobile text messages are a feasible and culturally acceptable method for mental health promotion and prevention among young women from urban slums in India.

Music training has been associated with enhanced language and learning skills, suggesting that music programs could play a role in helping low-income children to stay on track academically. Using a controlled, longitudinal design, the impact of group music instruction on English reading ability was assessed in 42 low-income Spanish-English bilingual children aged 6-9 years in Los Angeles. After one year, children who received music training retained their age-normed level of reading performance while a matched control group's performance deteriorated, consistent with expected declines in this population.

Here, we experimentally evaluate an innovative approach to the education of children in kindergarten that embeds support for self-regulation, particularly executive functions, into literacy, mathematics, and science learning activities. Results from a cluster randomized controlled trial involving 29 schools, 79 classrooms, and 759 children indicated positive effects on executive functions, reasoning ability, the control of attention, and levels of salivary cortisol and alpha amylase. Results also demonstrated improvements in reading, vocabulary, and mathematics at the end of kindergarten that increased into the first grade.

One hundred thirty-seven patients (GBS: 55, CIDP: 59, IgM-MGUSP: 23) with a new diagnosis or clinical relapse assessed both scales. Patients with GBS/CIDP were examined at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months; patients with IgM-MGUSP at 0, 3, and 12. We subjected all data to Rasch analyses, and calculated for each patient the magnitude of change on both scales using the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) related to the individual standard errors (SEs). A responder was defined as having an MCID-SE &#x2265;1.96. Individual scores on both measures were correlated with the EuroQoL thermometer (heuristic responsiveness). The I-RODS showed a significantly higher proportion of meaningful improvement compared with the INCAT-ONLS findings in GBS/CIDP. For IgM-MGUSP, the lack of responsiveness during the 1-year study did not allow a clear separation. Heuristic responsiveness was consistently higher with the I-RODS. The I-RODS more often captures clinically meaningful changes over time, with a greater magnitude of change, compared with the INCAT-ONLS disability scale in patients with GBS and CIDP.

The present study examined how the accumulation of risk factors including low IQ, low parental socioeconomic status (SES), history of adolescent cannabis use and childhood trauma, and high levels of subclinical psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) contributed to aberrant neurodevelopmental outcomes in 112 otherwise healthy adults recruited from the community. Participants were studied with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and voxel-wise statistical analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was used to examine the relation between cumulative risk (CR) for psychosis and white matter (WM) integrity across the whole brain. Analyses revealed that higher CR was significantly associated with lower FA in a cluster in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). These results suggest that risk factors previously associated with psychotic disorders are associated with WM integrity even in otherwise healthy adults and may provide insight into how previously identified risk factors contribute to the structural brain abnormalities associated with psychotic illness.

We examined a sample of 11,329 adults (&#x2265;18 years) who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) during the years 2005-2008. Insomnia was classified via a combination of self-reported positive physician diagnosis and high-frequency 'trouble falling asleep', 'waking during the night', 'waking too early', and 'feeling unrested during the day'. OSA was classified as a combination of a positive response to a physician-diagnosed condition, in addition to a high frequency of self-reported nocturnal 'snoring', 'snorting/stopping breathing' and 'feeling overly sleepy during the day'. Comorbid insomnia-OSA was further assessed by combining a positive response to either insomnia (all), or sleep apnoea (all), as classified above. Depressive symptomology was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), with scores of &gt;9 used to indicate depression. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for sleep disorders and depression were attained from logistic regression modelling adjusted for sex, age, poverty level, smoking status and body mass index (BMI). Those who reported insomnia, OSA or comorbid insomnia-OSA symptoms reported higher rates of depression (33.6%, 22.2%, 27.1%, respectively), and consistently reported poorer physical health outcomes than those who did not report sleep disorders.

Data was gathered from 361 low-income mothers (many with psychiatric diagnoses) reporting on their parenting behavior, parenting stress, and their child's adjustment, in a 2-wave longitudinal study over 5 years. Measurement models were developed to derive 4 broad parenting constructs (involvement, control, rejection, and stress) and 3 child adjustment constructs (internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and social competence). After measurement invariance of these constructs was confirmed across relevant groups and over time, both measurement models were integrated in a single crossed-lagged regression analysis of latent constructs. Multiple reciprocal influences were observed between parenting and perceived child adjustment over time: Externalizing and internalizing problems in children were predicted by baseline maternal parenting behaviors, and child social competence was found to reduce parental stress and increase parental involvement and appropriate monitoring.

A review of 26 studies involving 315 healthy and 78 stroke and dystonia patients showed that the direct effects of SES increased corticospinal excitability up to 40% (effect size: 0.2 to 6.1) and motor performance up to 14% (effect size: 0.3 to 3.1) but these two features did not correlate. SES did not affect measures of intracortical excitability. Most likely, a long-term potentiation-like mechanism in the excitatory glutamatergic connections between the primary sensory and motor cortices mediates the direct effects of SES on corticospinal excitability and motor performance. We propose two models for the untested hypothesis that adding SES to unilateral motor practice could magnify the magnitude of inter-limb transfer. If tenable, the hypothesis would expand the evolving repertoire of sensory augmentation of cross-education using mirrors and add SES as an alternative to conventional rehabilitation strategies such as constraint-induced movement therapy.",2014,11,1,"Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews","10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.07.013",NA,"Neurosci Biobehav Rev","eng","D000200; D007839; D006801; D009044; D009474; D011597; D013003; D050781","Action Potentials; Functional Laterality; Humans; Motor Cortex; Neurons; Psychomotor Performance; Somatosensory Cortex; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation",NA,"NA",NA,"Center for Human Movement Sciences, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands; Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Northumbria University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK."

Data were collected from 85 5- to 11-year-olds, mostly African American, who attended a public elementary school in a low-income urban area. Social competence was examined as a potential mediator, and attributional style was examined as a potential moderator of the relation between stressful life events and depressive symptoms. Separate analyses were conducted by age and gender. For older children and girls, main effects were found for stressful life events as predictors of depressive symptoms. Mediational analyses indicated that perceived peer acceptance served as a mediator of the relation between stressful life events and depressive symptoms for girls. In addition, attributional style moderated the relation between stressors and depressive symptoms in the older children. Together, findings suggest that significant relations exist among stressful life events, social and cognitive processes, and depressive symptoms in young urban children and that these relations are influenced by gender and development.",2014,1,1,"Journal of prevention &amp; intervention in the community","10.1080/10852352.2014.916574",NA,"J Prev Interv Community","eng","D001741; D002648; D002675; D003863; D005260; D006801; D008297; D011203; D011569; D012307; D012649; D012917; D012938; D013315; D013334; D014505","Black or African American; Child; Child, Preschool; Depression; Female; Humans; Male; Poverty; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Risk Factors; Self Concept; Social Adjustment; Social Perception; Stress, Psychological; Students; Urban Population",NA,"NA",NA,"a Pediatrics and Developmental Neuroscience , National Institute of Mental Health , Bethesda , Maryland , USA."

For children, delays in surgical procedures can have profound functional, social, and psychological effects with lifelong impact. The purpose of this study was to determine whether SES was related to meeting surgical wait time access targets for children. We also assessed the effects of gender, age, and distance to hospital on meeting access targets. Patient addresses, referral wait times, and surgical wait times were obtained for 39,287 surgical procedures between 2005 and 2011 at the Hospital for Sick Children. Using census data, we derived household income quintile, distance to hospital, and indices of social and material deprivation. These indices were correlated with the percentage of children meeting clinic referral wait time targets and receiving surgery within the Pediatric Canadian Access Targets for Surgery. Across all SES quintiles, 33% of children exceeded their referral wait time targets, and 28% of children exceeded their surgical wait time targets. Indices of material or social deprivation and age did not correlate with the time from referral to clinic consultation (P = .54, .40, and .58, respectively). Gender was statistically significant (P &lt; .001), but the difference was small (odds ratio = 0.87 for girls). Distance was also statistically significant (P = .005), and these differences translate into clinically meaningful differences in meeting wait time targets. Regarding completion of surgical procedures, material deprivation, distance, and gender did not correlate with longer wait times for surgery (P = .44, .09, .59, respectively). Social deprivation was statistically significant (P = .02) but not clinically significant. Increasing patient age was significantly associated with increased proportion of out-of-window wait times (P &lt; .001).

"24966095","Prevalence of epilepsy--an unknown quantity.","Ettore Beghi, Dale Hesdorffer","The incidence, prevalence, and mortality of epilepsy vary across countries with different economies. Differences can be explained by methodological problems, premature mortality, seizure remission, socioeconomic factors, and stigma. Diagnostic misclassification-one possible explanation-may result from inclusion of patients with acute symptomatic or isolated unprovoked seizures. Other sources of bias include age and ethnic origin of the target population, definitions of epilepsy, retrospective versus prospective ascertainment, sources of cases, and experienced and perceived stigma. Premature mortality is an issue in low-income countries (LICs), where treatment gap, brain infections, and traumatic brain injuries are more common than in high-income countries (HICs). Death rates may reflect untreated continued seizures or inclusion of acute symptomatic seizures. Lack of compliance with antiepileptic drugs has been associated with increased risk for death, increased hospital admissions, motor vehicle accidents, and fractures in poor communities. Epilepsy is a self-remitting clinical condition in up to 50% of cases. Studies in untreated individuals from LICs have shown that the proportion of remissions overlaps that of countries where patients receive treatment. When the identification of patients is based on spontaneous reports (e.g., door-to-door surveys), patients in remission may be less likely to disclose the disease for fear of stigmatization with no concurrent benefits. This might lead to underascertainment of cases when assessing the lifetime prevalence of epilepsy. In LICs, the proportion of people living in poverty is greater than in HICs. Poverty is associated with risk factors for epilepsy, risk for developing epilepsy, and increased mortality. The high incidence and prevalence of epilepsy found in LICs is also observed in low income individuals from HICs. Epileptogenic conditions are associated with an increased mortality. This may partly explain the difference between incidence and lifetime prevalence of epilepsy in LICs. Poverty within LICs and HICs could be a preventable cause of mortality in epilepsy.",2014,7,1,"Epilepsia","10.1111/epi.12579",NA,"Epilepsia","eng","D003906; D004827; D006801; D007182; D011203; D015995; D012959","Developing Countries; Epilepsy; Humans; Income; Poverty; Prevalence; Socioeconomic Factors",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Neurosciences, IRCCS Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research, Milano, Italy."

The risk of hypertension in LMICs is thought to be positively associated with socioeconomic status (SES). However, recent studies have provided data inconsistent with this concept. Thus, we assessed the association between SES and hypertension in rural populations of LMICs. Further, we explored whether this association differs according to geographical region. Through a search of databases we identified population-based studies that presented risk estimates for the association between SES, or any of its proxies, and hypertension. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random effects model. Overall, no association was detected between educational status and hypertension, whereas a positive association was observed with income. Interestingly, educational status was inversely associated with hypertension in East Asia {effect size [ES] 0.82 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78, 0.87]} but positively associated in South Asia [ES 1.28 (95% CI 1.14, 1.43)]. Higher income, household assets or social class were positively associated with hypertension in South Asia whereas no association was detected in East Asia and Africa. Compared with other occupations, farmers or manual labourers were associated with a lower risk for hypertension. Further, in regions such as Latin America, few studies were identified that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. We provide evidence that the association between hypertension and SES in rural populations of LMICs in Asia varies according to geographical region.

Therefore, our aim was two-fold: (i) to assess the prevalence of different patterns of alcohol consumption using the AUDIT-C scale, according to two different perspectives, i.e., that of family circle members or friends, and that of the general practitioners (GPs), and (ii) to examine the prevalence of medical and social consequences associated with alcohol consumption profiles. Data were drawn from two national surveys conducted in 2013. Investigators were respectively GPs and family circle members or friends. These surveys were respectively representative of GPs (n=1308) and of the general adult population (n=1018). The 12-month prevalence rates of harmful or at risk alcohol consumption rose respectively to 11.1% in the GPs adult patients and to 11.9% in the general adult population. The majority of participants with ""at risk"" alcohol consumption presented with significant social and medical consequences. Thus, more than seven out of ten participants with chronic at risk consumption endorsed significant negative social event potentially associated with alcohol like withdrawal of driving licence, getting divorced or separated, and losing friends. Over 10% of these participants had liver disease and diabetes mellitus, more than 30% increased blood pressure and nearly 50% anxiety disorder or major depression. Following adjustments for sociodemographic characteristics and alcohol treatment, prevalences of numerous social and medical consequences significantly differed between alcohol-dependent participants, chronic at risk consumers and episodic at risk consumers. Our results suggest that more than one adult out of ten in France showed during the past year harmful or ""at risk"" alcohol consumption, which appears insufficiently detected and treated.

The objective of this study is to examine the SES-obesity association in Cairo, Egypt. Multinomial regression analyses were conducted and predicted probabilities were found for overweight and obesity status among adult men and women in a stratified analysis. Data were taken from the 2007 Cairo Urban Inequity Study which collected information on 3993 individuals from 50 neighborhoods in the Cairo Governorate. Five different measures of SES were utilized - education, household expenditures, household assets, subjective wealth, and father's education. No significant associations were found between most measures of SES and overweight/obesity in this population. Overweight and obesity are prevalent across the SES spectrum. These findings suggest that obesity programs and policies should be targeted at all SES groups in Cairo, although specific mechanisms may vary by SES and should be explored further in future studies.",2014,3,1,"Journal of epidemiology and global health","10.1016/j.jegh.2013.09.001","PMC7320399","J Epidemiol Glob Health","eng","D000328; D015992; D004534; D005260; D006304; D054624; D006801; D016014; D008297; D008875; D009765; D011203; D025341; D012044; D012111; D057566; D012923; D011795; D014505; D055815","Adult; Body Mass Index; Egypt; Female; Health Status; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Poverty; Principal Component Analysis; Regression Analysis; Residence Characteristics; Self Report; Social Class; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urban Population; Young Adult",NA,"10.1370/afm.754; 10.1024/0300-9831.76.4.157; 10.1093/ajcn/81.3.714; 10.1038/sj.ejcn.1600931; 10.1017/s0007114599001610; 10.1079/phn2001286; 10.1016/s1353-8292(99)00018-0; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.05.023; 10.2188/jea.18.43; 10.1038/sj.ijo.0802716; 10.1016/s0140-6736(07)61696-1","None declared.","Duke University, Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Box 90086, Durham, NC 27708, United States."

This study explored demographic differences in toddlers' age and performance on developmental measures at the time of ASD assessment. Toddlers (16-39 months at evaluation) who screened at-risk for developmental delay on the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) or M-CHAT-Revised (M-CHAT-R) and follow-up interview participated in a diagnostic assessment. Of these, 44.7% were racial/ethnic minorities and 53.5% were non-minorities. Child race/ethnicity, years of maternal education (MEd), and household yearly income (YI) were parent-reported. Small but significant correlations were observed between MEd or YI and evaluation age and adaptive communication, socialization, and motor scores. Controlling for MEd and YI, minority racial/ethnic group did not predict child's performance on most measures and did not predict likelihood of ASD diagnosis. Differences in age at evaluation and receptive language skills were small effects. Significant but small effects emerged for SES and minority status on toddlers' age at evaluation and parent-reported adaptive skills, but these did not predict ASD diagnosis. The small magnitude of these effects suggests that routine, standardized screening for ASD in toddlers and timely access to diagnostic evaluation can reduce disparities in age at diagnosis and possibly reduce racial/ethnic disparities in access to services for ASD and other developmental delays.",2014,1,1,"Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP","10.1097/DBP.0000000000000014","PMC4388145","J Dev Behav Pediatr","eng","D057189; D002659; D002675; D002658; D004522; D005260; D006801; D007182; D007223; D008297; D008403; D008913; D011569; D012306; D012923","Checklist; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Child, Preschool; Developmental Disabilities; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Income; Infant; Male; Mass Screening; Minority Groups; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Risk; Social Class","R40 MC00270; F31 MH12550; HD39961; F31 MH012550; R01 HD039961","NA",NA,"*Department of Psychology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT; &#x2020;Departments of Clinical Psychology and Neuroscience, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA."

A population-based male cohort study.","Daniel Falkstedt, Kimmo Sorjonen, Tomas Hemmingsson, Ian J Deary, Bo Melin","The possible contributions of psychosocial functioning and intelligence differences to socioeconomic status (SES)-related inequalities in premature death were investigated. None of the previous studies focusing on inequalities in mortality has included measures of both psychosocial functioning and intelligence. The study was based on a cohort of 49 321 men born 1949-1951 from the general community in Sweden. Data on psychosocial functioning and intelligence from military conscription at &#x223c;18 years of age were linked with register data on education, occupational class, and income at 35-39 years of age. Psychosocial functioning was rated by psychologists as a summary measure of differences in level of activity, power of initiative, independence, and emotional stability. Intelligence was measured through a multidimensional test. Causes of death between 40 and 57 years of age were followed in registers. The estimated inequalities in all-cause mortality by education and occupational class were attenuated with 32% (95% confidence interval: 20-45%) and 41% (29-52%) after adjustments for individual psychological differences; both psychosocial functioning and intelligence contributed to account for the inequalities. The inequalities in cardiovascular and injury mortality were attenuated by as much as 51% (24-76%) and 52% (35-68%) after the same adjustments, and the inequalities in alcohol-related mortality were attenuated by up to 33% (8-59%). Less of the inequalities were accounted for when those were measured by level of income, with which intelligence had a weaker correlation. The small SES-related inequalities in cancer mortality were not attenuated by adjustment for intelligence. Differences in psychosocial functioning and intelligence might both contribute to the explanation of observed SES-related inequalities in premature death, but the magnitude of their contributions likely varies with measure of socioeconomic status and cause of death.

Most behavioral investigations in experimental parkinsonism have employed short-term observation windows to assess motor impairments. We postulated that an analysis of longer-term free exploratory behavior could provide further insights into the complex fine structure of altered locomotor activity in parkinsonian animals. To this end, we video-monitored 23 h of free locomotor behavior and extracted several behavioral measures before and after the expression of a severe parkinsonian phenotype following bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the rat dopaminergic substantia nigra. Unbiased stereological cell counting verified the degree of midbrain tyrosine hydroxylase positive cell loss in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. In line with previous reports, overall covered distance and maximal motion speed of lesioned animals were found to be significantly reduced compared to controls. Before lesion surgery, exploratory rat behavior exhibited a bimodal distribution of maximal speed values obtained for single movement episodes, corresponding to a ""first"" and ""second gear"" of motion. 6-OHDA injections significantly reduced the incidence of second gear motion episodes and also resulted in an abnormal prolongation of these fast motion events. Likewise, the spatial spread of such episodes was increased in 6-OHDA rats. The increase in curvature of motion tracks was increased in both lesioned and control animals. We conclude that the discrimination of distinct modes of motion by statistical decomposition of longer-term spontaneous locomotion provides useful insights into the fine structure of fluctuating motor functions in a rat analog of Parkinson's disease.",2013,1,1,"Frontiers in systems neuroscience","10.3389/fnsys.2013.00095","PMC3842038","Front Syst Neurosci","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.expneurol.2009.11.016; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2583-07.2007; 10.2307/2346101; 10.1126/science.2402638; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0943-12.2012; 10.1016/j.brainres.2004.12.009; 10.1038/nrn877; 10.1007/s00221-008-1656-6; 10.1016/S0165-0270(99)00194-6; 10.1016/S0149-7634(01)00022-7; 10.1016/S0166-4328(01)00290-X; 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2005.04.005; 10.1016/0014-4886(92)90038-R; 10.1016/S0006-8993(00)03270-4; 10.1111/j.1365-2818.1986.tb02764.x; 10.1111/j.1365-2818.1987.tb02837.x; 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2012.07.013; 10.1038/334345a0; 10.1016/0006-8993(75)90253-X; 10.1093/brain/95.3.475; 10.1016/j.expneurol.2011.08.003; 10.1006/exnr.1997.6418; 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2005.04238.x; 10.1038/nrn2915; 10.1016/0006-8993(94)91533-4; 10.1126/science.564552; 10.1016/S0301-0082(96)00015-9; 10.1016/S0301-0082(96)00040-8; 10.1016/j.mri.2007.10.010; 10.1016/j.expneurol.2008.02.006; 10.1093/brain/awq032; 10.1016/j.bbr.2005.11.026; 10.1016/j.expneurol.2012.08.018; 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2012.01.029; 10.1016/S0079-6123(02)35006-4; 10.1002/ar.1092310411; 10.1016/j.expneurol.2013.01.014",NA,"Department of Neurophysiology and Pathophysiology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, University of Hamburg Hamburg, Germany."

However, little is known about the impact of exercise on neurodevelopment during the adolescent years, particularly with regard to white matter microstructure, as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Both tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and tractography-based along-tract statistics were utilized to examine the relationship between white matter microstructure and aerobic exercise in adolescent males, ages 15-18. Furthermore, we examined the data by both (1) grouping individuals based on aerobic fitness self-reports (high fit (HF) vs. low fit (LF)), and (2) using VO2 peak as a continuous variable across the entire sample. Results showed that HF youth had an overall higher number of streamline counts compared to LF peers, which was driven by group differences in corticospinal tract (CST) and anterior corpus callosum (Fminor). In addition, VO2 peak was negatively related to FA in the left CST. Together, these results suggest that aerobic fitness relates to white matter connectivity and microstructure in tracts carrying frontal and motor fibers during adolescence.

This report describes the performance of a large group of typically developing children and adolescents and examines the impact of age and sociocultural variables on test performance. The NTCB was administered to a sample of 1,020 typically developing males and females ranging in age from 3 to 20 years, diverse in terms of socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity, as part of the new publicly accessible Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING) data resource, at 9 sites across the United States. General additive models of nonlinear age-functions were estimated from age-differences in test performance on the 8 NTCB subtests while controlling for family SES and genetic ancestry factors (GAFs). Age accounted for the majority of the variance across all NTCB scores, with additional significant contributions of gender on some measures, and of SES and race/ethnicity (GAFs) on all.

"24174656","The impoverished brain: disparities in maternal education affect the neural response to sound.","Erika Skoe, Jennifer Krizman, Nina Kraus","Despite the prevalence of poverty worldwide, little is known about how early socioeconomic adversity affects auditory brain function. Socioeconomically disadvantaged children are underexposed to linguistically and cognitively stimulating environments and overexposed to environmental toxins, including noise pollution. This kind of sensory impoverishment, we theorize, has extensive repercussions on how the brain processes sound. To characterize how this impoverishment affects auditory brain function, we compared two groups of normal-hearing human adolescents who attended the same schools and who were matched in age, sex, and ethnicity, but differed in their maternal education level, a correlate of socioeconomic status (SES). In addition to lower literacy levels and cognitive abilities, adolescents from lower maternal education backgrounds were found to have noisier neural activity than their classmates, as reflected by greater activity in the absence of auditory stimulation. Additionally, in the lower maternal education group, the neural response to speech was more erratic over repeated stimulation, with lower fidelity to the input signal. These weaker, more variable, and noisier responses are suggestive of an inefficient auditory system. By studying SES within a neuroscientific framework, we have the potential to expand our understanding of how experience molds the brain, in addition to informing intervention research aimed at closing the achievement gap between high-SES and low-SES children.",2013,10,30,"The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2102-13.2013","PMC6618371","J Neurosci","eng","D000161; D000293; D001307; D001309; D001921; D004522; D005260; D006801; D008297; D008425; D012923; D012931; D013067","Acoustic Stimulation; Adolescent; Auditory Perception; Auditory Threshold; Brain; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Male; Maternal Behavior; Social Class; Social Environment; Speech Perception",NA,"10.1016/j.tics.2007.08.015; 10.1016/j.heares.2008.08.004; 10.1542/peds.113.4.846; 10.1073/pnas.1213555110; 10.1121/1.4799804; 10.1093/cercor/bhp024; 10.1038/228477a0; 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233; 10.1177/001391657500700406; 10.2307/1602387; 10.2307/1131822; 10.1007/s10162-010-0236-1; 10.1073/pnas.1309518110; 10.1093/cercor/bht028; 10.1126/science.1082163; 10.1016/S0022-1031(73)80005-8; 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01651.x; 10.1037/0894-4105.22.3.293; 10.1007/s10643-011-0491-8; 10.3109/00016489709117760; 10.1037/0003-066X.59.2.77; 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.23.112001.112349; 10.1073/pnas.0811910106; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1995.tb00522.x; 10.1121/1.381985; 10.2307/3653456; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2009.01380.x; 10.1093/aler/ahl003; 10.1016/j.jenvp.2006.04.001; 10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.003; 10.1038/nrn2897; 10.1371/journal.pone.0018712; 10.1016/j.bbr.2013.01.007; 10.2105/AJPH.2007.133215; 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103538; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4205-12.2013; 10.1073/pnas.0901123106; 10.1073/pnas.1206628109; 10.1038/415073a; 10.1111/1467-9280.00483; 10.1371/journal.pone.0042486; 10.1348/000709909X475055; 10.1162/jocn.2009.21101; 10.1016/j.envres.2005.09.008; 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2007.07.021; 10.1038/nrn2882; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2012.06463.x; 10.1016/j.cogbrainres.2005.05.004; 10.1016/j.clinph.2011.07.037; 10.1073/pnas.1201575109; 10.1073/pnas.1532872100; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4985-05.2006; 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00238; 10.1044/1092-4388(2007/067); 10.1017/S0954579408000412; 10.1001/archpsyc.57.11.1077; 10.1093/bmb/63.1.171; 10.1016/j.heares.2012.12.008; 10.1073/pnas.1304437110; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2005.00394.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00600.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2012.01147.x; 10.1016/S0378-5955(03)00225-9; 10.1016/S0013-4694(97)95213-9; 10.1542/peds.99.3.318; 10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00142; 10.1097/AUD.0b013e318241e880; 10.1016/0006-8993(92)91243-8; 10.1037/a0013917; 10.3389/neuro.09.003.2010; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.01.021; 10.1542/peds.102.2.346; 10.1126/science.1167025; 10.1016/0006-8993(75)90748-9; 10.1126/science.6612332; 10.1016/j.neuron.2011.12.005; 10.1016/S0378-5955(03)00074-1; 10.1371/journal.pone.0035744; 10.1007/s12070-011-0163-4; 10.1016/S0031-3955(05)70077-8; 10.1097/AUD.0b013e3181cdb272; 10.1093/cercor/bhr196; 10.1038/nrn1668; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00807.x; 10.1093/cercor/bht103; 10.1121/1.385431; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2004.03.011; 10.1046/j.0956-7976.2003.psci_1475.x; 10.1073/pnas.261707398; 10.1038/ncomms1849",NA,"Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory, Bilingualism and Psycholinguistics Research Group, Department of Communication Sciences, Institute for Neuroscience, Department of Neurobiology and Physiology, and Department of Otolaryngology, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208."

We obtained data from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 45 countries between 2000 and 2009. The respondents were women (15-49 years) and their children (0-59 months). Results showed that living in a slum neighborhood was associated with infant mortality (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.15-1.57) irrespective of individual and household characteristics and this risk was attenuated among children born to women who had received antenatal care from a health professional (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.63-0.99). Results also indicated that increasing child age exacerbated the risk for stunting associated with slum residency (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.16-1.23). The findings suggest that improving material circumstances in urban slums at the neighborhood level as well as increasing antenatal care coverage among women living in these neighborhoods could help reduce infant mortality and stunted child growth.

"24148106","Effect of the serotonin transporter gene and of environment on the continuity of anxiety and depression traits throughout adolescence.","M Nobile, A Greco, G Perna, P Colombo, V Bianchi, M Bellina, R Giorda, D Monzani, O Carlet,  ..., M Molteni","Aims. Many studies of various stress reactive phenotypes suggest that 5-HTTLPR short allele carriers (S-carriers) are characterised by the stable trait of negative affectivity that is converted to psychopathology only under conditions of stress. In this study, we examined the moderating role of the 5-HTTLPR on the relationship between two objective chronic risk factors, i.e. socioeconomic status (SES) and family structure, and internalising symptoms across adolescence. Methods. A multigroup path analysis was employed in a general adolescent population sample of a 5-year follow-up study. Results. Internalising problems were significantly more stable in the S-carriers. The focus on the main dimensions of internalising problems, i.e. anxiety and depression, revealed two different developmental patterns. In the S-carriers Anxiety problems seemed to be more stable and to predict a possible evolution towards the development of Depressive problems. In the long allele homozygotes (LL-subjects) the anxiety trait was significantly less stable, and, in late-adolescence, seemed to be significantly predicted by SES, suggesting a possible gene-environment interaction (G&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;E). Family structure seemed to play a role in a G&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;E perspective only until early-adolescence, while during late-adolescence SES seemed to play a pivotal role in interaction with 5-HTTLPR, with the S-allele playing a protective role. Conclusions. Future models of the developmental link between environmental adversities and internalising behaviour therefore need to consider that the effect of G&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;E interaction, may be associated with internalising behaviour via different mechanisms during different time frames and that shifts in the strength of this effect should be expected across development.",2014,12,1,"Epidemiology and psychiatric sciences","10.1017/S2045796013000565","PMC7192166","Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci","eng",NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Child Psychiatry,'Eugenio Medea' Scientific Institute,Bosisio Parini,Italy."

Much research has been conducted on the factors that influence service use in this population, but the methods generally used cannot easily identify the complex interactions that are thought to exist. In this paper, we examine predictors of subsequent service use among respondents to a population health survey who met criteria for a past-year mood, anxiety or substance-related disorder. To determine service use, we use an administrative database including all physician consultations in the period of interest. To identify predictors, we use classification tree (CART) analysis, a data mining technique with the ability to identify unsuspected interactions. We compare results to those from logistic regression models. We identify 1213 individuals with past-year disorder. In the year after the survey, 24% (n=312) of these had a mental health-related physician consultation. Logistic regression revealed that age, sex and marital status predicted service use. CART analysis yielded a set of rules based on age, sex, marital status and income adequacy, with marital status playing a role among men and by income adequacy important among women. CART analysis proved moderately effective overall, with agreement of 60%, sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 53%. Results highlight the potential of data-mining techniques to uncover complex interactions, and offer support to the view that the intersection of multiple statuses influence health and behaviour in ways that are difficult to identify with conventional statistics.

However, the causality of such neighbourhood effects remains uncertain. We followed all children born in Sweden from 1975-1989 who lived in its three largest cities by the age of 15 years and for whom complete information was available about individual and contextual factors (N = 303 465). All biological siblings were identified in the sample (N = 179 099). Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the effect of neighbourhood deprivation on violent criminality and substance misuse between the ages of 15 and 20 years, while taking into account the cross-classified data structure (i.e. siblings in the same families attending different schools and living in different neighbourhoods at age 15). In the crude model, an increase of 1 SD in neighbourhood deprivation was associated with a 57% increase in the odds of being convicted of a violent crime (95% CI 52%-63%). The effect was greatly attenuated when adjustment was made for a number of observed confounders (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.06-1.11). When we additionally adjusted for unobserved familial confounders, the effect was no longer present (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84-1.10). Similar results were observed for substance misuse. The results were not due to poor variability either between neighbourhoods or within families. We found that the adverse effect of neighbourhood deprivation on adolescent violent criminality and substance misuse in Sweden was not consistent with a causal inference.

A total of 44 chronic stroke patients, recruited in Belgium and Benin, respectively European high-income and African low-income countries. This longitudinal, single-cohort, observational study with 1 intervention period and 4 time-points of assessments (2 baseline, 1 post-intervention and 1 follow-up) was structured in 3 periods: pre-intervention period (1 month), intervention period (3 months) and follow-up period (3 month). Intervention consisted of a 3 times/week group-based brisk walking programme. Primary outcome measures were ACTIVLIM-Stroke questionnaire and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Secondary outcome measures were the Stroke Impairment Assessment Set (SIAS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). All outcome measures were stable during the pre-intervention period (p&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;0.16). They all improved significantly after intervention (p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.01), except the HADS (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.058).

Structural equation modeling of direct and indirect associations of risk factors with the latent depression outcome using a cross-sectional dataset of 342 patients with PD. A model with acceptable fit was generated that explained 41% of the variance in depression. In the final model, 3 PD-specific variables (increased disease duration, more severe motor symptoms, the use of levodopa) and 6 nonspecific variables (female sex, history of anxiety and/or depression, family history of depression, worse functioning on activities of daily living, and worse cognitive status) were maintained and significantly associated with depression. Nonspecific risk factors had a 3-times-higher influence in the model than PD-specific risk factors. In this cross-sectional study, we showed that nonspecific factors may be more prominent markers of depression than PD-specific factors.

However, few studies have prospectively evaluated neurodevelopmental deficits in very young children with SCD. We analyzed baseline neurodevelopmental data from a cohort of 80 infants and toddlers with SCD to identify primary disease-related events and sociodemographic risk factors associated with early developmental delay. This is an analysis of baseline date of a 4-year mixed, cross-sectional/longitudinal study. Full-term children at age 3.5 years or younger with SCD (any genotype) were eligible. Neurodevelopmental evaluations (Bayley II) were conducted at ages 9, 15, 21, 30, and 40 months. Demographics, hematologic variables, and medical events were obtained. Significant neurodevelopmental deficits were evident: 17.5% scoring &gt;2SD below the mean on Bayley Mental Index or Motor Index. Odds ratio of significant developmental delay was &gt;9 times more likely among those who had experienced vaso-occlusive pain episodes, after controlling for socioeconomic status (SES), gender, pneumonia/acute chest syndrome, and hemoglobin concentration. Male gender was also a risk factor for developmental delay. Early cognitive and motor delays were present in young children with SCD, with higher prevalence among those who had experienced pain crises. Increased vulnerability of male gender is consistent with other at-risk populations but has not been previously addressed in SCD research. Furthermore, these delays are not sufficiently explained by lower SES. Significant developmental delay in children with SCD may go unrecognized by primary care practices, medical specialty clinics, or parents.

"23833332","Integrating the Human Sciences to Evolve Effective Policies.","Anthony Biglan, Christine Cody","This paper describes an evolutionary perspective on human development and wellbeing and contrasts it with the model of self-interest that is prominent in economics. The two approaches have considerably different implications for how human wellbeing might be improved. Research in psychology, prevention science, and neuroscience is converging on an evolutionary account of the importance of two contrasting suites of social behavior-prosociality vs. antisocial behaviors (crime, drug abuse, risky sexual behavior) and related problems such as depression. Prosociality of individuals and groups evolves in environments that minimize toxic biological and social conditions, promote and richly reinforce prosocial behavior and attitudes, limit opportunities for antisocial behavior, and nurture the pursuit of prosocial values. Conversely, antisocial behavior and related problems emerge in environments that are high in threat and conflict. Over the past 30 years, randomized trials have shown numerous family, school, and community interventions to prevent most problem behaviors and promote prosociality. Research has also shown that poverty and economic inequality are major risk factors for the development of problem behaviors. The paper describes policies that can reduce poverty and benefit youth development. Although it is clear that the canonical economic model of rational self-interest has made a significant contribution to the science of economics, the evidence reviewed here shows that it must be reconciled with an evolutionary perspective on human development and wellbeing if society is going to evolve public policies that advance the health and wellbeing of the entire population.",2013,6,1,"Journal of economic behavior &amp; organization",NA,"PMC3699200","J Econ Behav Organ","eng",NA,NA,"R01 HD060922; RC2 DA028946","NA",NA,"Oregon Research Institute."

This study is the first to investigate whether advanced paternal age at birth is associated with eating disorder risk using a twin study design capable of examining both phenotypic and genetic associations. In a large, population-based sample of female twins aged 8-17 years in mid-puberty or beyond (n = 1722), we investigated whether advanced paternal age was positively associated with disordered eating symptoms and an eating disorder history [i.e. anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) or binge eating disorder (BED)] in offspring. Biometric twin models examined whether genetic and/or environmental factors underlie paternal age effects for disordered eating symptoms. Advanced paternal age was positively associated with disordered eating symptoms and an eating disorder history, where the highest level of pathology was observed in offspring born to fathers &#x2a7e;40 years old. The results were not accounted for by maternal age at birth, body mass index (BMI), socio-economic status (SES), fertility treatment or parental psychiatric history. Twin models indicated decreased genetic, and increased environmental, effects on disordered eating with advanced paternal age. Advanced paternal age increased risk for the full spectrum of eating pathology, independent of several important covariates. However, contrary to leading hypotheses, environmental rather than genetic factors accounted for paternal age-disordered eating associations. These data highlight the need to explore novel (potentially environmental) mechanisms underlying the effects of advanced paternal age on offspring eating disorder risk.",2014,4,1,"Psychological medicine","10.1017/S0033291713001426","PMC3835756","Psychol Med","eng","D000293; D002648; D004200; D001068; D005260; D006801; D008824; D010331; D010641; D012042","Adolescent; Child; Diseases in Twins; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Humans; Michigan; Paternal Age; Phenotype; Registries","T32 MH082761; R01 MH092377; R01 MH082054; MDR-96630; 1 R01 MH0820-54; 1 F31 MH0844701; 1 R01 MH092377-01; 5 T32 MH082761","NA","None of the authors have biomedical financial conflicts of interest or other potential conflicts of interest to disclose.","Department of Psychology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA."

Opioids mediate their effects through mu opioid receptors (MOR), but minimal information exists regarding MOR-related striatal signaling relevant to the human condition. The striatum is a structure central to reward and habitual behavior and neurobiological changes in this region are thought to underlie the pathophysiology of addiction disorders. We examined molecular mechanisms related to MOR in postmortem human brain striatal specimens from a homogenous European Caucasian population of heroin abusers and control subjects and in an animal model of heroin self-administration. Expression of ets-like kinase 1 (ELK1) was examined in relation to polymorphism of the MOR gene OPRM1 and drug history. A characteristic feature of heroin abusers was decreased expression of MOR and extracellular regulated kinase signaling networks, concomitant with dysregulation of the downstream transcription factor ELK1. Striatal ELK1 in heroin abusers associated with the polymorphism rs2075572 in OPRM1 in a genotype dose-dependent manner and correlated with documented history of heroin use, an effect reproduced in an animal model that emphasizes a direct relationship between repeated heroin exposure and ELK1 dysregulation. A central role of ELK1 was evidenced by an unbiased whole transcriptome microarray that revealed ~20% of downregulated genes in human heroin abusers are ELK1 targets.

After adjustment for age, socioeconomic status, and health risk factors (body mass index, physical activity and smoking), mood disorders were associated with gastro oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), recurrent headaches, blackouts and/or epilepsy, liver disorders and pulmonary disease in older people, whilst anxiety disorders were significantly associated with thyroid, GORD and other gastrointestinal disorders, and psoriasis. Increased odds of high medical burden were associated with both mood and anxiety disorders.

This pilot study included 20 children from Mexico City (MC) (6.17 years &#xb1; 0.63 years) and 15 controls (6.27 years &#xb1; 0.76 years). We performed full paediatric examinations, a history of outdoor exposures, seven-day dietary recalls, serum inflammatory markers and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Children in MC had significantly higher concentrations of IL-6 (p=0.001), marked reductions in total blood neutrophils (p= 0.0002) and an increase in monocytes (p=0.005). MC children also had an insufficient Vitamin D intake and spent less time outdoors than controls (p&lt;0.001) in an environment characterized by decreased UV light, with ozone and fine particulates concentrations above standard values. There were no significant differences between the cohorts in DXA Z scores. The impact of systemic inflammation, vitamin D insufficiency, air pollution, urban violence and poverty may have long-term bone detrimental outcomes in exposed paediatric populations as they grow older, increasing the risk of low bone mass and osteoporosis.

We have previously shown that adolescents making the transition to high school present a significant increase in cortisol levels, the main product of HPA axis activation. In the present study, we evaluated whether a school-based education program developed according to the current state of knowledge on stress in psychoneuroendocrinology decreases cortisol levels and/or depressive symptoms in adolescents making the transition to high school. Participants were 504 Year 7 high school students from two private schools in the Montreal area. Adolescents of one school were exposed to the DeStress for Success Program while adolescents from the other school served as controls. Salivary cortisol levels and depressive symptomatology were measured before, immediately after as well as 3 months after exposure to the program. Measures of negative mood were obtained at baseline in order to determine whether adolescents starting high school with specific negative moods were differentially responsive to the program. The results show that only adolescents starting high school with high levels of anger responded to the intervention with a significant decrease in cortisol levels. Moreover, we found that adolescents who took part in the intervention and showed decreasing cortisol levels following the intervention (responders) were 2.45 times less at risk to suffer from clinical and subclinical depressive states three months post-intervention in comparison to adolescents who showed increasing cortisol levels following the intervention (nonresponders). This study provides the first evidence that a school-based program on stress is effective at decreasing cortisol levels and depressive symptomatology in adolescents making the transition to high school and it helps explain which adolescents are sensitive to the program and what are some of the characteristics of these individuals.",2013,9,26,"Neuroscience","10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.01.057",NA,"Neuroscience","eng","D000293; D016022; D002648; D003863; D004493; D005260; D006801; D006854; D007030; D008297; D010913; D012574; D013315; D013334","Adolescent; Case-Control Studies; Child; Depression; Education; Female; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Male; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Schools; Stress, Psychological; Students",NA,"NA",NA,"Centre for Studies on Human Stress, Research Center of the Mental Health Institute, Louis-H.

The paper discusses these in the context of the ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice. Some of the ethical issues in managing somatization include being influenced by patient distress rather than rational medical decision-making, inadequate attention to the cultural meaning of symptoms, psychologizing versus medicalizing, the ethics of nomenclature and labels, communicating ethically with patients, and managing them adequately given lack of evidence and training. An ethical approach to managing somatization in this context would include using an integrated and simultaneous medical and psychiatric approach. To ensure patient beneficence, the medical, psychological and social assessment should be undertaken side-by-side as much as possible and should be cost effective. Respecting patient autonomy by using adequate communication methods and the patient's cultural model of the illness as part of management is also integral to ethical practice. In the developing world, issues of equity are also an important ethical concern.

The striatum, a component of this circuitry, thus is a possible neural substrate of schizophrenia. Striatum volume, however, is believed to be differentially influenced by neuroleptic treatment due to an anterior-posterior D2 receptor density gradient. We thus rigorously parcellated it into subregions in order to assess whether neuroleptic effect on group differences is regionally specific. 29 chronic, male, schizophrenia patients and 28 male, normal controls (NCs), group-matched for handedness, age, and parental SES, underwent structural brain imaging on a 1.5 Tesla GE system. We manually measured the volume, normalized for intracranial contents, of the striatum parcellated into anatomic subregions and their corresponding limbic, associative and sensorimotor functional subregions and performed clinical correlations. First, we found a localized bilateral enlargement of the posterior putamen in medicated chronic schizophrenia. Second, we showed associative striatal subregion volumes correlated with executive function in schizophrenia subjects and, to a lesser extent, in NCs. Third, we showed associative striatal subregions inversely correlated with negative symptoms but conversely, the ventral/limbic striatum did not correlate with positive or negative clinical symptoms. Our novel parcellation strategy, based on rigorous delineation of the ventral striatum, allowed for the demonstration of localized volumetric differences between schizophrenia and NCs. Furthermore, by parcellating the striatum into functional subregions we demonstrated significant positive correlations between the volume of the associative striatum and executive functioning in schizophrenia, adding further support to the importance of its role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",2013,4,1,"Schizophrenia research","10.1016/j.schres.2012.08.032",NA,"Schizophr Res","eng","D000328; D000367; D000704; D003072; D003342; D020233; D006801; D007091; D008032; D008279; D008297; D008875; D009483; D011569; D012044; D012559; D055815","Adult; Age Factors; Analysis of Variance; Cognition Disorders; Corpus Striatum; Gait Disorders, Neurologic; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Limbic System; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Regression Analysis; Schizophrenia; Young Adult","K05 MH 700047; R01 MH 40799; R01 MH 50747","NA",NA,"Clinical Neuroscience Division, Laboratory of Neuroscience, Department of Psychiatry, VA Boston Healthcare System, Brockton Division, Brockton, MA 02301, USA."

We examined the prevalence of child physical and sexual abuse and the associations of child abuse with early contextual, family, and individual factors using a community-based sample in Ontario. The Ontario Child Health Study is a province-wide health survey of children aged 4 through 16 years. Conducted in 1983, a second wave was undertaken in 1987 and a third in 2000-2001. The third wave (N=1,928) included questions about exposure to physical and sexual abuse in childhood. Males reported significantly more child physical abuse (33.7%), but not severe physical abuse (21.5%), than females (28.2% and 18.3%, respectively). Females reported significantly more child sexual abuse (22.1%) than males (8.3%). Growing up in an urban area, young maternal age at the time of the first child's birth, and living in poverty, predicted child physical abuse (and the severe category), and sexual abuse. Childhood psychiatric disorder was associated with child physical abuse (and the severe category), while parental adversity was associated with child sexual abuse and severe physical abuse. Siblings of those who experienced either physical abuse or sexual abuse in childhood were at increased risk for the same abuse exposure; the risk was highest for physical abuse. These findings highlight important similarities and differences in risk factors for physical and sexual abuse in childhood. Such information is useful in considering approaches to prevention and early detection of child maltreatment. Clinicians who identify physical abuse or sexual abuse in children should be alert to the need to assess whether siblings have experienced similar exposures. This has important implications for assessment of other children in the home at the time of identification with the overall goal of reducing further occurrence of abuse.",2013,1,1,"Child abuse &amp; neglect","10.1016/j.chiabu.2012.06.005",NA,"Child Abuse Negl","eng","D000293; D000328; D000367; D002648; D002649; D002650; D002675; D005260; D006801; D008297; D008423; D001523; D009864; D011203; D015995; D012111; D012189; D012307; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Child; Child Abuse; Child Abuse, Sexual; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Male; Maternal Age; Mental Disorders; Ontario; Poverty; Prevalence; Residence Characteristics; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Young Adult",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada L8S 4K1."
"23198833","Association of a higher density of specialist neuroscience providers with fewer deaths from stroke in the United States population.","Atman Desai, Kimon Bekelis, Wenyan Zhao, Perry A Ball, Kadir Erkmen","Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability. Given that neurologists and neurosurgeons have special expertise in this area, the authors hypothesized that the density of neuroscience providers is associated with reduced mortality rates from stroke across US counties. This is a retrospective review of the Area Resource File 2009-2010, a national county-level health information database maintained by the US Department of Health and Human Services. The primary outcome variable was the 3-year (2004-2006) average in cerebrovascular disease deaths per million population for each county. The primary independent variable was the combined density of neurosurgeons and neurologists per million population in the year 2006. Multiple regression analysis was performed, adjusting for density of general practitioners (GPs), urbanicity of the county, and socioeconomic status of the residents of the county. In the 3141 counties analyzed, the median number of annual stroke deaths was 586 (interquartile range [IQR] 449-754), the median number of neuroscience providers was 0 (IQR 0-26), and the median number of GPs was 274 (IQR 175-410) per million population. On multivariate adjusted analysis, each increase of 1 neuroscience provider was associated with 0.38 fewer deaths from stroke per year (p &lt; 0.001) per million population. Rural location (p &lt; 0.001) and increased density of GPs (p &lt; 0.001) were associated with increases in stroke-related mortality. Higher density of specialist neuroscience providers is associated with fewer deaths from stroke. This suggests that the availability of specialists is an important factor in survival after stroke, and underlines the importance of promoting specialist education and practice throughout the country.",2013,2,1,"Journal of neurosurgery","10.3171/2012.10.JNS12518",NA,"J Neurosurg","eng","D000328; D004522; D005260; D058006; D006297; D006801; D008297; D015999; D009462; D009493; D011203; D011237; D012189; D019035; D020521; D014481; D014483; D019037","Adult; Educational Status; Female; General Practice; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Neurology; Neurosurgery; Poverty; Predictive Value of Tests; Retrospective Studies; Rural Health Services; Stroke; United States; United States Dept. of Health and Human Services; Urban Health Services",NA,"NA",NA,"Section of Neurosurgery, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756, USA."

We assessed whether multiple variables related to self-regulation (perceived mental effort) emotional states (e.g., anxiety, stress, etc.) and motivational states (e.g., boredom, engagement, etc.) may co-occur or interact with frontal attentional processing probed in two matched-samples of fourteen lower-SES and higher-SES adolescents. ERP and EEG activation were measured during a task probing selective attention to sequences of tones. Pre- and post-task salivary cortisol and self-reported emotional states were also measured. At similar behavioural performance level, the higher-SES group showed a greater ERP differentiation between attended (relevant) and unattended (irrelevant) tones than the lower-SES group. EEG power analysis revealed a cross-over interaction, specifically, lower-SES adolescents showed significantly higher theta power when ignoring rather than attending to tones, whereas, higher-SES adolescents showed the opposite pattern. Significant theta asymmetry differences were also found at midfrontal electrodes indicating left hypo-activity in lower-SES adolescents. The attended vs. unattended difference in right midfrontal theta increased with individual SES rank, and (independently from SES) with lower cortisol task reactivity and higher boredom. Results suggest lower-SES children used additional compensatory resources to monitor/control response inhibition to distracters, perceiving also more mental effort, as compared to higher-SES counterparts. Nevertheless, stress, boredom and other task-related perceived states were unrelated to SES.

"23142704","Socioeconomic factors and leukocyte telomere length in a multi-ethnic sample: findings from the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA).","Judith E Carroll, Ana V Diez-Roux, Nancy E Adler, Teresa E Seeman","Previous findings have linked lower socioeconomic status (SES) with elevated morbidity and mortality. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL), which also has been associated with age-related disease morbidity and mortality, is a marker of aging at the cellular level, making it a valuable early biomarker of risk and an indicator of biological age. It is hypothesized that SES will be associated with LTL, indicating that SES influences disease risk by accelerating biological aging. In the present sample we test for associations of childhood SES and adult SES (i.e. education, income, home ownership) with LTL, and examine whether these associations vary by racial/ethnic group. Analyses on 963 subjects (18.7% White, 53% Hispanics, and 28.5% African American) from the stress ancillary study of the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis revealed a significant difference in LTL between home owners and renters in Hispanic and White participants (p&lt;.05), but not amongst African Americans (p=.98). There were no linear associations of adult education or family income with LTL, however, there was an inverse association between father's education and LTL (p=.03). These findings suggest that for Whites and Hispanics renting vs. owning a home is associated with an older biological age; however we did not replicate previous findings linking education with LTL.",2013,2,1,"Brain, behavior, and immunity","10.1016/j.bbi.2012.10.024","PMC3544984","Brain Behav Immun","eng","D001741; D000368; D000369; D050197; D015415; D004522; D005191; D005260; D006630; D006801; D007182; D007962; D008137; D008297; D008875; D012307; D012959; D059506; D044465","Black or African American; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Atherosclerosis; Biomarkers; Educational Status; Family Characteristics; Female; Hispanic or Latino; Humans; Income; Leukocytes; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Telomere Shortening; White People","R01 HL101161; N01 HC095167; T32-MH19925; N01 HC095161; N01 HC095164; N01-HC 95159; N01-HC 95169; N01 HC095169; N01 HC095165; N01 HC095168; N01 HC095163; N01 HC095162; N01 HC095159; N01 HC095166; N01 HC095160","NA",NA,"The Cousins Center for Psychoneuroimmunology, Semel Institute of Neuroscience and Human Behavior, School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, United States."

SES is related to basal cortisol and diurnal change, but it is not clear if SES is associated with cortisol reactivity to stress. To address this question, we examined the relationship between two indices of SES, parental education and concentrated neighborhood disadvantage, and the cortisol reactivity of African-American adolescents to a modified version of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). We found that concentrated disadvantage was associated with cortisol reactivity and this relationship was moderated by gender, such that higher concentrated disadvantage predicted higher cortisol reactivity and steeper recovery in boys but not in girls. Parental education, alone or as moderated by gender, did not predict reactivity or recovery, while neither education nor concentrated disadvantage predicted estimates of baseline cortisol. This finding is consistent with animal literature showing differential vulnerability, by gender, to the effects of adverse early experience on stress regulation and the differential effects of neighborhood disadvantage in adolescent males and females. This suggests that the mechanisms underlying SES differences in brain development and particularly reactivity to environmental stressors may vary across genders.",2012,1,1,"Frontiers in human neuroscience","10.3389/fnhum.2012.00277","PMC3469875","Front Hum Neurosci","eng",NA,NA,"R01 DA014129; R01 HD043078; R01 HD055689; UL1 RR024134","10.1037/a0017376; 10.1037/a0020660; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2005.00863.x; 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233; 10.1093/jpepsy/27.7.575; 10.1001/jama.294.22.2879; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2005.02.010; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2007.05.002; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.02.030; 10.1177/0956797609355566; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e31824206fd; 10.1037/0278-6133.25.6.704; 10.1037/a0013342; 10.1111/j.1469-8986.2006.00414.x; 10.1097/01.psy.0000221236.37158.b9; 10.1097/01.psy.0000195967.51768.ea; 10.1001/jama.290.15.2023; 10.1037/a0014433; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.11.007; 10.1037/0033-2909.130.3.355; 10.1007/s12160-010-9224-2; 10.1136/jech.2009.092676; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2007.11.004; 10.1037/0003-066X.59.2.77; 10.1111/1467-8624.00469; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.02008.x; 10.1016/j.brainres.2006.06.072; 10.1210/jc.2004-0981; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.03.032; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2007.08.008; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2004.11.126; 10.1037/a0015611; 10.1146/annurev.psych.58.110405.085605; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2009.02.010; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2009.09.019; 10.1136/jech.2010.108332; 10.1038/nrn2897; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2009.12.009; 10.1001/jama.284.5.592; 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2006.03.014; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2005.03.002; 10.1016/j.ntt.2009.08.002; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2009.04.008; 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.18.1.341; 10.1177/14034948010290020101; 10.1037/a0025314; 10.1093/cercor/bhn225; 10.1111/1469-8986.3860951; 10.1016/j.cpr.2004.01.003; 10.1016/j.pbb.2006.07.012; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05331.x; 10.1073/pnas.0902971106; 10.1037/a0024768; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2007.27; 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2005.10.012; 10.1126/science.277.5328.918; 10.1073/pnas.0710189104; 10.1001/jama.2009.754; 10.1016/S0140-6736(99)01376-8; 10.1097/01.PSY.0000035717.78650.A1; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2004.07.008; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2008.09.006; 10.1002/dev.20097; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2010.08.004; 10.1037/0022-006X.73.6.1146; 10.1007/s11064-007-9339-4; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.12.006; 10.1007/s10578-012-0304-3; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2006.01.009",NA,"Department of Psychology, Center for Neuroscience and Society, Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, PA, USA."

As a result of the increasing ageing process, the assessment of nutritional status and dietary habits, as well as the assessment of self-care, is needed to plan selected actions aimed at improving the quality of life in the third and fourth life spans. A cross-sectional study was carried out on a randomly selected sample of 200 healthy older adults (&#x2265;65 years old), attending community centres for older people in Pavia, Northern Italy. Ninety-two percent of the recruited subjects participated in the survey. Anthropometric measurements and the Mini Nutritional Assessment were performed. Dietary habits, nutritional knowledge and self-care were investigated using a questionnaire administered by two dietitians. The majority of subjects were low socio-economic status and overweight [mean (SD) body mass index = 28.4 (4.3) kg/m(2) ], 12% were malnourished according to their Mini Nutritional Assessment score and the majority of the arm muscle circumference measurements were below the 10th percentile, predicting accelerated loss of lean mass, even in the healthy independently living older adults. Only 30% of the sample had adequate dietary habits, whereas the ability to self-care was good for the whole sample. The unhealthy and unbalanced diet, frequently too rich in sugar and fats and low in protein intake, might explain being overweight and the loss of lean mass in the study subjects.",2013,2,1,"Journal of human nutrition and dietetics : the official journal of the British Dietetic Association","10.1111/j.1365-277X.2012.01289.x",NA,"J Hum Nutr Diet","eng","D000368; D000369; D001132; D001823; D001825; D015992; D004032; D004034; D005247; D005260; D015577; D007722; D006801; D007558; D008297; D044342; D015596; D009752; D009765; D050177; D011203; D012111; D012648; D012923; D011795","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Body Composition; Body Fluid Compartments; Body Mass Index; Diet; Diet Surveys; Feeding Behavior; Female; Geriatric Assessment; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Italy; Male; Malnutrition; Nutrition Assessment; Nutritional Status; Obesity; Overweight; Poverty; Residence Characteristics; Self Care; Social Class; Surveys and Questionnaires",NA,"NA",NA,"Faculty of Medicine, Department of Public Health, Neuroscience, Experimental and Forensic Medicine, Section of Human Nutrition and Dietetics, Via Bassi, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy."

In particular, the influence of socio-economic and cultural factors on morality has been broadly investigated by psychologists but as yet has not been investigated by neuroscientists. The value of bridging these two areas both theoretically and methodologically has, however, been suggested. This study aims at providing a first connection between neuroscientific and psychological literature on morality by investigating whether socio-economic dimensions, i.e., living socio-geographic/economic area, immigrant status and socio-economic status (SES), affect moral reasoning as operationalized in moral domain theory (a seminal approach in psychological studies on morality) and in Greene et al. (2001) perspective (one of the main approaches in neuroethics research). Participants were 81 primary school (M = 8.98 years; SD = 0.39), 72 middle school (M = 12.14 years; SD = 0.61), and 73 high school (M = 15.10 years; SD = 0.38) students from rural and urban areas. Participants' immigrant status (native vs. immigrant) and family SES level were recorded. Moral reasoning was assessed by means of a series of personal and impersonal dilemmas based on Greene et al. (2001) neuroimaging experiment and a series of moral and socio-conventional rule dilemmas based on the moral domain theory. Living socio-geographic/economic area, immigrant status and SES mainly affected evaluations of moral and, to a higher extent, socio-conventional dilemmas, but had no impact on judgment of personal and impersonal dilemmas. Results are mainly discussed from the angle of possible theoretical links and suggestions emerging for studies on moral reasoning in the frameworks of neuroscience and psychology.",2012,1,1,"Frontiers in human neuroscience",NA,"PMC3449439","Front Hum Neurosci","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.1080/13803390802298064; 10.1037/0003-066X.59.2.77; 10.1093/brain/awr334; 10.1371/journal.pone.0008865; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181e1a23c; 10.1126/science.1062872; 10.1093/scan/nsn026; 10.1111/1467-8624.00266; 10.1016/j.tics.2008.09.006; 10.1016/j.clinph.2008.10.010; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e31819783be; 10.1016/j.archger.2006.05.004; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.12.001; 10.1016/S0010-0277(02)00048-3; 10.1016/j.cognition.2005.07.005; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2005.00394.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00542.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00851.x; 10.1037/0033-2909.132.1.98; 10.1080/00207594.2011.568486; 10.1177/0956797611402513",NA,"Department of Psychology, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart Milano, MI, Italy."
"22973216","Explicit and implicit issues in the developmental cognitive neuroscience of social inequality.","Amedeo D'Angiulli, Sebastian J Lipina, Alice Olesinska","The appearance of developmental cognitive neuroscience (DCN) in the socioeconomic status (SES) research arena is hugely transformative, but challenging. We review challenges rooted in the implicit and explicit assumptions informing this newborn field. We provide balanced theoretical alternatives on how hypothesized psychological processes map onto the brain (e.g., problem of localization) and how experimental phenomena at multiple levels of analysis (e.g., behavior, cognition and the brain) could be related. We therefore examine unclear issues regarding the existing perspectives on poverty and their relationships with low SES, the evidence of low-SES adaptive functioning, historical precedents of the ""alternate pathways"" (neuroplasticity) interpretation of learning disabilities related to low-SES and the notion of deficit, issues of ""normativity"" and validity in findings of neurocognitive differences between children from different SES, and finally alternative interpretations of the complex relationship between IQ and SES. Particularly, we examine the extent to which the available laboratory results may be interpreted as showing that cognitive performance in low-SES children reflects cognitive and behavioral deficits as a result of growing up in specific environmental or cultural contexts, and how the experimental findings should be interpreted for the design of different types of interventions-particularly those related to educational practices-or translated to the public-especially the media. Although a cautionary tone permeates many studies, still, a potential deficit attribution-i.e., low-SES is associated with cognitive and behavioral developmental deficits-seems almost an inevitable implicit issue with ethical implications.

We found that parents talk to their young children about letters, differentiating them from pictures, by 1-2 years of age and that some of these conversational patterns change across the preschool years in ways that emphasize important features of letters, such as their shape. We also found that children talk about letters and pictures in distinct ways, suggesting an implicit understanding of some of the differences between letters and pictures at an early age. Some differences in parent-child conversations about letters were found as a function of socioeconomic status: Lower SES families appeared to focus more on alphabetic order than higher SES families.

The study compared children with a diagnosis of TBI (n=40) to a healthy age-, gender-, and socioeconomic status (SES)-matched control group (n=19) at 10 years post-injury. Outcomes and predictors of functional skills were investigated. Poorer adaptive skills were evident for those with more severe injury. Behavioral difficulties were present regardless of injury severity. Post-injury, arithmetic skills were the most compromised in the longer term.

Results provided evidence that adolescent future orientation was associated independently and negatively with problem behaviors. In addition, adolescents from large-size schools reported higher levels of problem behaviors than their age mates from small-size schools, controlling for individual-level covariates. Furthermore, an interaction effect between adolescent future orientation and school future orientation climate was found, suggesting influences of school future orientation climate on the link between adolescent future orientation and problem behaviors as well as variations in effects of school future orientation climate across different levels of adolescent future orientation. Specifically, the negative association between adolescent future orientation and problem behaviors was stronger at schools with a more positive climate of future orientation, whereas school future orientation climate had a significant and unexpectedly positive relationship with problem behaviors for adolescents with low levels of future orientation.

Studies in stroke and TBI reported a significant association between lesion location and depression. Both depression and apathy are significant predictors of poor recovery among patients with brain injuries, and of steeper cognitive and functional decline among patients with neurodegenerative disorders. Poor insight and judgment are frequently found among patients with brain injury or degeneration. There is increasing evidence that damage to specific brain regions, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, is associated with inappropriate emotional reactions in social contexts and diminished anxiety and concern for the future. In severe cases, behavioural changes may also include poor decision-making in the social realm, deficits in goal-directed behavior, and lack of insight into these changes.

Most studies assessing the association between subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) and apathy have reported a relative increase in the frequency and severity of apathy, although discrepant findings have also been reported. Several mechanisms to explain apathy in PD have been proposed, from dopaminergic imbalances in frontal-basal ganglia circuits to dysfunction of nondopaminergic circuits and the cingulate gyrus. Future studies should provide reliable and valid instruments to diagnose apathy in PD, and should examine the mechanism of apathy accounting for relevant confounders, such as depression and cognitive deficits, and important contextual factors.

This converging, multidisciplinary science of human development has profound implications for our ability to enhance the life prospects of children and to strengthen the social and economic fabric of society. Drawing on these multiple streams of investigation, this report presents an ecobiodevelopmental framework that illustrates how early experiences and environmental influences can leave a lasting signature on the genetic predispositions that affect emerging brain architecture and long-term health. The report also examines extensive evidence of the disruptive impacts of toxic stress, offering intriguing insights into causal mechanisms that link early adversity to later impairments in learning, behavior, and both physical and mental well-being. The implications of this framework for the practice of medicine, in general, and pediatrics, specifically, are potentially transformational. They suggest that many adult diseases should be viewed as developmental disorders that begin early in life and that persistent health disparities associated with poverty, discrimination, or maltreatment could be reduced by the alleviation of toxic stress in childhood. An ecobiodevelopmental framework also underscores the need for new thinking about the focus and boundaries of pediatric practice. It calls for pediatricians to serve as both front-line guardians of healthy child development and strategically positioned, community leaders to inform new science-based strategies that build strong foundations for educational achievement, economic productivity, responsible citizenship, and lifelong health.",2012,1,1,"Pediatrics","10.1542/peds.2011-2663",NA,"Pediatrics","eng","D000328; D001921; D002657; D002669; D002675; D006293; D006801; D010372; D010819; D002666; D012931; D013315","Adult; Brain; Child Development; Child Welfare; Child, Preschool; Health Promotion; Humans; Pediatrics; Physician's Role; Psychology, Child; Social Environment; Stress, Psychological",NA,"NA",NA,NA

First, ""events"" are extracted from the given signals; next, one tries to align events across the different time series. The better the alignment, the more similar the N time series are considered to be. The similarity measures quantify the reliability of the events (the fraction of ""nonaligned"" events) and the timing precision. So far, SES has been developed for pairs of one-dimensional (Part I) and multidimensional (Part II) point processes. In this letter (Part III), SES is extended from pairs of signals to N &gt; 2 signals. The alignment and SES parameters are again determined through statistical inference, more specifically, by alternating two steps: (1) estimating the SES parameters from a given alignment and (2), with the resulting estimates, refining the alignment. The SES parameters are computed by maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation (step 1), in analogy to the pairwise case. The alignment (step&#xa0;2) is solved by linear integer programming. In order to test the robustness and reliability of the proposed N-variate SES method, it is first applied to synthetic data. We show that N-variate SES results in more reliable estimates than bivariate SES. Next N-variate SES is applied to two problems in neuroscience: to quantify the firing reliability of Morris-Lecar neurons and to detect anomalies in EEG synchrony of patients with mild cognitive impairment. Those problems were also considered in Parts I and II, respectively.

The thalamo-cortical projection through the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) serves as the final step in these feedback sub-loops. We evaluated abnormalities in the ALIC fiber tract in schizophrenia using both structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). 20 chronic schizophrenia patients and 22 male, normal controls group matched for handedness, age, and parental SES, underwent structural and DTI brain imaging on a 1.5 Tesla GE system. We manually measured ALIC volume normalized for intracranial contents (ICC) using structural brain images and then registered these high resolution structural brain scan derived ALIC label maps to DTI space allowing for the measurement in the ALIC of diffusion indices including, fractional anisotropy (FA) mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD). We found in the ALIC of chronic schizophrenia subjects, compared with normal controls, bilaterally lower FA and bilaterally higher RD, but no differences in AD, MD, or relative volume. Cognitive correlations in schizophrenia patients showed, in particular, that higher left ALIC FA correlated positively with better verbal and nonverbal declarative/episodic memory performance.

"21896306","Imaging biomarkers in Parkinson's disease.","David J Brooks, Nicola Pavese","Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons associated with intracellular Lewy inclusion bodies. The result is poverty of movement, increased muscle rigidity, and tremor at rest and on posture. Midbrain/nigral structural abnormalities can be demonstrated in vivo with both transcranial sonography (TCS) and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) while positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) ligands exist to demonstrate dopamine terminal dysfunction. These radiotracers are markers of dopamine storage capacity, vesicular monoamine and dopamine transporter availability. While loss of putamen dopaminergic function leads to motor disability, Lewy bodies not only target dopamine neurons but have also been observed in serotoninergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic neurons. As a consequence, non-dopaminergic neurotransmission is also impaired resulting in non-motor symptoms including sleep disturbance, fatigue, depression, dementia, and autonomic dysfunction. PET and SPECT ligands exist to interrogate the function of monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons. Cortical and limbic Lewy body disease is seen in more advanced PD and this can be detected with FDG PET as abnormal covariance between levels of resting brain metabolism in these regions. Additionally, widespread microglial activation can be detected in PD with PET.

We examined a consecutive series of 259 patients with Parkinson's disease admitted to 2 movement disorders clinics for regular follow-ups. All patients were assessed with a comprehensive psychiatric interview that included structured assessments for depression, anxiety, and apathy. The main finding was that all 9 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (4th edition) diagnostic criteria for major depression (ie, depressed mood, diminished interest or pleasure, weight or appetite changes, sleep changes, psychomotor changes, loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt, poor concentration, and suicidal ideation) identified a patient class (severe depression group) with high statistical significance. Latent class analysis also demonstrated a patient class with minimal depressive symptoms (no-depression group), and a third patient class with intermediate depressive symptoms (moderate depression). Anxiety and apathy were both significant comorbid conditions of moderate and severe depression.

Even in affluent nations, 70% of reported cases either do not receive the recommended level of treatment or do not get treated at all, and this percentage does not reflect cases of depression that go unreported due to lack of access to health care, stigma, or other reasons. In developing countries, the World Health Organization estimates that &lt;10% receive proper depression care due to poverty, stigma, and lack of governmental mental health resources and providers. Current treatments do not work for everyone, and even people who achieve remission face a high risk of recurrence and residual disability. The development of low-cost effective interventions that can serve either as initial therapy for mild symptoms or as adjunctive therapy for partial responders to medication is an immense unmet need. Positive activity interventions (PAIs) teach individuals ways to increase their positive thinking, positive affect, and positive behaviors. The majority of such interventions, which have obtained medium-size effect sizes, have been conducted with nondepressed individuals, but two randomized controlled studies in patients with mild clinical depression have reported promising initial findings. In this article, the authors review the relevant literature on the effectiveness of various types of PAIs, draw on social psychology, affective neuroscience and psychophamacology research to propose neural models for how PAIs might relieve depression, and discuss the steps needed to translate the potential promise of PAIs as clinical treatments for individuals with major and minor depressive disorders.",2011,8,1,"Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.)","10.1089/acm.2011.0139",NA,"J Altern Complement Med","eng","D000339; D001519; D035843; D003863; D003866; D006240; D006266; D006801; D017063; D013850","Affect; Behavior; Biomedical Research; Depression; Depressive Disorder; Happiness; Health Education; Humans; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Thinking",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Psychology, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, USA."

We assessed a nationally representative sample of 3-6-year-old children (n = 1332) from 150 communities of Madagascar using standard tests of development. We found that children whose families were in the top wealth quintile or whose mothers had secondary education performed significantly better across almost all measures of cognitive and language development and had better linear growth compared with children of women in the lowest wealth quintile or women with no education. These differences between children of low and high socioeconomic position were greatest for receptive language, working memory, and memory of phrases. The mean difference in the scores between children in the highest and lowest socioeconomic status categories doubled between age 3 and age 6, and the biggest gaps across socioeconomic position by age 6 were in receptive language and sustained attention.

Recent evidence supports this possibility, showing an inverse association of childhood SES with adult markers of systemic inflammation. In this study, we further investigate this association, extending prior studies to include an examination of multiple indices of SES across distinct periods of childhood. Subjects were 112 men and women, 40-60 years of age (88.6% Caucasian). Childhood SES was indexed by a composite of three indicators of parental wealth (parental home and vehicle ownership, and number of bedrooms per child in the family home) averaged across 2 year periods of childhood between 1 and 18 years old. Higher adult serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6 were associated with lower SES in early childhood (years 1-2) (&#x3b2;=-.05, p&lt;.05), associations that were independent of adult age, personal income, educational attainment, gender, race, body mass index, and physical activity.

Data were collected using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire-Parent report (SDQ-P) as part of a more extensive questionnaire. A total of 14,699 parents of children aged 8-13 years (response rate 78%) participated. Associations between SDQ scores and epilepsy, other chronic disease, age, gender, and socioeconomic factors were explored using logistic regression analysis. Children with epilepsy (CWE) (n=110) had a significantly higher frequency of psychiatric symptoms (37.8% vs. 17.0% in controls, p&lt;0.001). Gender differences were found in several subscales of the SDQ; girls had more emotional problems, whereas boys had higher scores regarding peer relationship and hyperactivity/inattention problems. Male gender, low socioeconomic status (family income below poverty limit and living in a single parent home), and other chronic disease (asthma/diabetes) were independent risk factors of developing psychiatric symptoms, along with epilepsy. Having or having had epilepsy was, however, a much stronger risk factor for developing psychiatric symptoms in girls than in boys [odds ratio (OR) 4.2 vs. OR 2.3]. A minor effect of age was seen only in girls with epilepsy, with an increased risk of psychiatric symptoms in age group 10-13 years (OR 1.28 for scoring borderline/abnormal on SDQ-total difficulties). Borderline/abnormal impact scores were found in 31.8% of CWE compared with 13.0% of controls (p&lt;0.001).

Reviews of published research, analyses of federal child health data sets, consultation with early development and state and local program experts, and site visits were conducted between 2006 and 2009, with statistics and literature reviews updated through mid-2010. The economic and social conditions of children's lives, especially in the early years, affect their health and development in childhood and across the life course. Forty percent of children in the U.S. live in families with incomes &lt;200% of the federal poverty level and consequently are at higher risk of poor health and development. Recent advances in neuroscience and life course epidemiology reveal that these children are more likely to experience chronic or ""toxic"" stress resulting from frequent or sustained adverse experiences, increasing their lifetime risk of chronic disease. Intervening early in childhood by providing a safe, stable, nurturing, and stimulating environment can improve cognitive, emotional, and behavioral development and health outcomes in children--particularly socially and economically disadvantaged children--and both their health and social and economic well-being as adults. Coordination of multiple programs and funding sources, along with higher standards of accountability for services, outcomes, and ongoing evaluation of effectiveness, are needed to ensure more effective state and local programs providing early developmental support. Federal leadership and funding are needed to ensure that children at high risk for multiple adverse exposures and their families receive attention and services as early as possible.",2011,1,1,"American journal of preventive medicine","10.1016/j.amepre.2010.10.001",NA,"Am J Prev Med","eng","D000293; D000328; D002648; D002654; D002669; D002675; D018479; D004777; D005190; D005378; D054624; D006801; D007223; D011203; D011640; D012944; D014481","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child Care; Child Welfare; Child, Preschool; Early Intervention, Educational; Environment; Family; Financial Support; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Infant; Poverty; Public Policy; Social Support; United States",NA,"NA",NA,"NORC at University of Chicago, Bethesda, Maryland 20814, USA."

A prospective observational study followed Latinas from pregnancy through 13 months postpartum. Prenatal predictors of PPD included depression, recent IPV exposure, remote IPV exposure, non-IPV trauma history, poverty, low social support, acculturation, high parity, and low education. Postpartum depression was measured at 3, 7, and 13 months after birth with the Beck's Depression Inventory-Fast Screen. Strength of association was evaluated using bivariate and multivariable odds ratio analysis. Subjects were predominantly low income, monolingual Spanish, and foreign-born, with mean age of 27.7. Recent IPV, prenatal depression, non-IPV trauma, and low social support were associated with greater likelihood of PPD in bivariate analyses. Recent IPV and prenatal depression continued to show significant association with PPD in multivariate analyses, with greater odds of PPD associated with recent IPV than with prenatal depression (adjusted OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.38, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001 for recent IPV and adjusted OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.48, p&lt;&#x2009;0.0001 for prenatal depression).

The aim for this study was to carry out for the first time a longitudinal assessment of this association with the aim of clarifying the predictive role between anosognosia and apathy in Alzheimer's disease. A consecutive series of 213 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease were assessed for the presence of apathy and anosognosia using a specific neuropsychiatry assessment. One hundred fifty four of the patients (72%) had a follow-up assessment between 1 and 4 years after the baseline evaluation. Patients with anosognosia at baseline had a significant increase in apathy scores during follow-up relative to patients without anosognosia at both assessments. Conversely, patients with or without apathy had an increase of similar magnitude in anosognosia scores. In conclusion, anosognosia is a significant predictor of apathy in Alzheimer's disease.

"20967214","Why are there social gradients in preventative health behavior? A perspective from behavioral ecology.","Daniel Nettle","Within affluent populations, there are marked socioeconomic gradients in health behavior, with people of lower socioeconomic position smoking more, exercising less, having poorer diets, complying less well with therapy, using medical services less, ignoring health and safety advice more, and being less health-conscious overall, than their more affluent peers. Whilst the proximate mechanisms underlying these behavioral differences have been investigated, the ultimate causes have not. This paper presents a theoretical model of why socioeconomic gradients in health behavior might be found. I conjecture that lower socioeconomic position is associated with greater exposure to extrinsic mortality risks (that is, risks that cannot be mitigated through behavior), and that health behavior competes for people's time and energy against other activities which contribute to their fitness. Under these two assumptions, the model shows that the optimal amount of health behavior to perform is indeed less for people of lower socioeconomic position. The model predicts an exacerbatory dynamic of poverty, whereby the greater exposure of poor people to unavoidable harms engenders a disinvestment in health behavior, resulting in a final inequality in health outcomes which is greater than the initial inequality in material conditions. I discuss the assumptions of the model, and its implications for strategies for the reduction of health inequalities.",2010,10,13,"PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0013371","PMC2954172","PLoS One","eng","D015438; D006801; D008962; D011203; D012959","Health Behavior; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Poverty; Socioeconomic Factors",NA,"NA","<b>Competing Interests: </b>The author has declared that no competing interests exist.","Centre for Behaviour and Evolution, Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University, Newcastle, United Kingdom."

"20856795","Development of social variation in reproductive schedules: a study from an English urban area.","Daniel Nettle, Maria Cockerill","There is striking social variation in the timing of the onset of childbearing in contemporary England, with the mean age at first motherhood about 8 years earlier in the most deprived compared to the least deprived neighbourhoods. However, relatively little is known about how these social differences in reproductive schedule develop in childhood. We studied the development of differences in reproductive schedules, using a cross-sectional survey over 1000 school students aged 9-15 in the metropolitan borough of North Tyneside. Students from more deprived neighbourhoods had earlier ideal ages for parenthood than those from more affluent ones, and these differences were fully apparent by age 11. We found evidence consistent with three mechanisms playing a role in maintaining the socioeconomic gradient. These were: vertical intergenerational transmission (students whose own parents were younger at their birth wanted children younger); oblique intergenerational transmission (students in neighbourhoods where parents were younger in general wanted children earlier); and low parental investment (students who did not feel emotionally supported by their own parents wanted children at a younger age). Our results shed some light on the proximate factors which may be involved in maintaining early childbearing in disadvantaged communities. They help understand why educational initiatives aimed at adolescents tend to have no effect, whereas improving the well-being of poor families with young children may do so. Our results also suggest that there will be considerable intergenerational inertia in the response of reproductive schedules to changing socioecological conditions.",2010,9,15,"PloS one","10.1371/journal.pone.0012690","PMC2939869","PLoS One","eng","D000293; D000328; D002648; D002657; D003430; D005190; D005260; D006801; D008297; D011204; D012098; D012959; D006113; D014506; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child Development; Cross-Sectional Studies; Family; Female; Humans; Male; Poverty Areas; Reproduction; Socioeconomic Factors; United Kingdom; Urban Renewal; Young Adult",NA,"NA","<b>Competing Interests: </b>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Centre for Behaviour and Evolution, Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University, Newcastle, United Kingdom."

"20559086","Niels Stensen (1638-1686): scientist, neuroanatomist, and saint.","Paolo Perrini, Giuseppe Lanzino, Giuliano Francesco Parenti","Niels Stensen (1638-1686) was a prominent Danish scientist who laid the foundations of paleontology, geology, and crystallography. He undertook a personal search for the truth, rejecting many assumptions of his time, and he struggled to acquire a firm foundation of knowledge based on close observation and rigorous experimentation. Niels Stensen is known eponymously for the discovery of the duct of the parotid gland (ductus stenonianus) but most clinicians are not familiar with his contributions to anatomy beyond his studies on the glands. In 1665, he delivered a lecture in Paris on the anatomy of the brain, the Discours sur l'anatomie du cerveau (""A Dissertation on the Anatomy of the Brain""), which is a seminal investigation on methods in neuroscience. His scientific letter on a hydrocephalic calf represents an early pathophysiological investigation on hydrocephalus.

In Spain, following the intellectual poverty of the absolutist rule of King Ferdinand, medicine took on a new flourishing lease of life in the last third of the century under the leadership of its most distinguished proponent, Santiago Ramon y Cajal. In April 1903, and in spite of the country's multiple political and social ups and downs, Madrid organised a great medical convention (14th International Congress of Medicine) that gathered together the foremost figures in the neurosciences. This work attempts to describe the situation in which neurology found itself at that time, as well as the socio-political context, and to highlight the most important contributions that were made in our specialty. A whole medical generation from around the world enthusiastically took part and 1681 communications and papers were presented, many of which dealt with neurological topics.

This review aims to highlight these questions, to outline their potential significance, and to suggest routes by which they might be approached. Although remarkably few neural studies have been carried out so far, there exists a large literature of previous behavioural work. This behavioural research provides an invaluable guide for future neuroimaging work, but also poses an important challenge for it: how can we ensure that the neural data contributes predictive or diagnostic power over and above what can be derived from behaviour alone? We discuss some of the open mechanistic questions which Cognitive Neuroscience may have the power to illuminate, spanning areas including language, numerical cognition, stress, memory, and social influences on learning. These questions have obvious practical and societal significance, but they also bear directly on a set of longstanding questions in basic science: what are the environmental and neural factors which affect the acquisition and retention of declarative and nondeclarative skills? Perhaps the best opportunity for practical and theoretical interests to converge is in the study of interventions. Many interventions aimed at improving the cognitive development of low SES children are currently underway, but almost all are operating without either input from, or study by, the Cognitive Neuroscience community. Given that longitudinal intervention studies are very hard to set up, but can, with proper designs, be ideal tests of causal mechanisms, this area promises exciting opportunities for future research.",2010,1,1,"Frontiers in human neuroscience","10.3389/neuro.09.003.2010","PMC2820392","Front Hum Neurosci","eng",NA,NA,NA,"10.3102/00346543075001001; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2008.03.001; 10.1016/j.econedurev.2005.10.007; 10.1038/4551057a; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01021.x; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.00995.x; 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.00834.x; 10.2307/1130253; 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233; 10.1111/1467-8624.t01-1-00383; 10.3389/neuro.09.032.2009; 10.1111/1467-8624.00457; 10.1037/0012-1649.37.2.231; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2008.03.003; 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01622.x; 10.1126/science.1128317; 10.1126/science.1170769; 10.1146/annurev.psych.58.110405.085551; 10.2307/146372; 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2006.12.017; 10.1037/0894-4105.22.3.293; 10.1126/science.1151148; 10.1161/01.STR.0000221281.69373.4e; 10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.1087; 10.1080/00223890802634290; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01641.x; 10.2307/1131385; 10.1038/scientificamericanmind1207-36; 10.1111/1467-8624.00330; 10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190057; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.02008.x; 10.1073/pnas.0811910106; 10.1016/j.brainres.2006.06.072; 10.1162/003465304323031049; 10.1126/science.1171999; 10.1093/cercor/bhk001; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60032-4; 10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70267-3; 10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.003; 10.1126/science.1128898; 10.1002/(SICI)1099-0720(199704)11:2&lt;113::AID-ACP424&gt;3.0.CO;2-F; 10.1177/0009922806297303; 10.1037/0735-7044.121.3.602; 10.1111/1467-8624.00612; 10.1146/annurev.psych.093008.100442; 10.1016/S0010-0285(02)00500-5; 10.1016/1041-6080(94)90003-5; 10.1002/ddrr.46; 10.1162/jocn.2009.21101; 10.1073/pnas.0600888103; 10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2007.02.019; 10.1016/S0006-3223(00)00965-3; 10.1017/S0954579401003133; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.02.031; 10.1038/sj.npp.1301544; 10.1037/0003-066X.53.2.185; 10.1126/science.1158808; 10.1126/science.159.3810.56; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00746.x; 10.2105/AJPH.2008.148353; 10.1037/0003-066X.61.2.99; 10.1037/0012-1649.44.4.895; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00600.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2005.00394.x; 10.1353/foc.2005.0006; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00542.x; 10.1016/S0193-953X(02)00112-0; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.01.021; 10.1093/cercor/bhp076; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01131.x; 10.1037/0003-066X.53.2.109; 10.1006/pmed.1998.0279; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.07.003; 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.3.022806.091411; 10.1001/archpedi.161.8.730; 10.1001/jama.285.18.2339; 10.1007/s11881-003-0004-6; 10.2307/748203; 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093633; 10.1016/S0006-3223(02)01836-X; 10.1176/appi.ajp.163.4.735; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00714.x; 10.1598/RRQ.21.4.1; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2004.01.002; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00807.x; 10.1007/s004269900007; 10.1073/pnas.0030098100; 10.1046/j.0956-7976.2003.psci_1475.x; 10.1006/pmed.1998.0280; 10.1162/jocn.2008.20040",NA,"Neukom Institute for Computational Science, Dartmouth College Hanover, NH, USA."

One potential pathway accounting for this relationship may be an association between low SES and personality characteristics that affect health. Associations among parent's education, current SES (education and income), and personality were examined among 233 African Americans and Caucasian, male and female community volunteers. Using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to model neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness simultaneously, participant's education, household income, and father's and mother's education each had significant main effects on personality. When examining the life course--the combination of both current and childhood SES--distinctive patterns emerged for each domain, depending upon whether mother's or father's education was used to index childhood SES. When using mother's education as a childhood SES index, a high life course SES (high participant's SES/high mother's education) was associated with high extraversion and openness. Using father's education as a childhood SES index, a low life course SES (low participant's SES/low father's education) was associated with disproportionately high neuroticism and low conscientiousness. These effects did not differ by race or sex.

In addition, to assess variability of STW phase duration and to compare the relative duration of STW phases between the 2 groups. Cross-sectional. Research laboratory. A convenience sample of persons with hemiparesis (n=10; age 50-67y) more than 6 months after stroke and 10 controls matched for sex, age, height, and body mass index. Not applicable. Relative duration of STW phases, SE of measurement in percentage of the mean, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Four STW phases were defined: rise preparation, transition, primary gait initiation, and secondary gait initiation. The subjects with stroke needed 54% more time to complete the STW task than the controls did. ICCs ranged from .38 to .66 and .22 to .57 in the stroke and control groups, respectively. SEs of measurement in percentage of the mean values were high, particularly in the transition phase: 54.1% (stroke) and 50.4% (controls). The generalized linear model demonstrated that the relative duration of the transition phase was significantly longer in the stroke group.

Aim of the study was validate specific criteria to diagnose apathy in PD, and to examine its association with subsyndromes of depression and dementia. A series of 164 patients with PD, 44 patients with ""primary"" depression and no PD, 23 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and 26 age-comparable healthy controls underwent a comprehensive psychiatric assessment that included a structured psychiatric interview and the Apathy Scale. A set of seven diagnostic criteria showed high sensitivity and specificity for clinically diagnosed apathy. Fifty-two of the 164 patients with PD (32%) met diagnostic criteria for apathy. Eighty-three percent of patients with apathy had comorbid depression and 56% had dementia. Only 5 of the 40 PD patients (13%) with neither depression nor dementia had apathy.

Unlike other executive function rating instruments, the CHEXI focuses specifically on inhibitory control and working memory, without including items that overlap with the diagnostic criteria of ADHD. The CHEXI was found to discriminate very well between children fulfilling the criteria for ADHD and normally developing children, also when controlling for the effect of IQ and socioeconomic status (SES). Both sensitivity and specificity of the two CHEXI subscales were shown to be high using either parent or teacher ratings. The highest overall classification rate was found for parent ratings on the inhibition subscale, with sensitivity and specificity reaching 93.3.

The aim of this study was to assess the chronological association between apathy and parkinsonism in AD. Longitudinal study of a consecutive series of patients with AD. Dementia clinic from a tertiary clinical center. One hundred sixty-nine patients meeting diagnostic criteria for AD. A consecutive series of 169 patients with probable AD were assessed for the presence of parkinsonism, cognitive deficits, apathy, and depression with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and a comprehensive neuropsychiatry assessment. One hundred thirty-six (80%) of the patients had a follow-up assessment between 1 and 4 years after the baseline evaluation. Scores on apathy, parkinsonism, and depression scales at follow-up were the main outcome measures. Patients with apathy at baseline or those who developed apathy during follow-up had a significant increase in parkinsonism at follow-up when compared with patients with no apathy at both assessments. The association between apathy and increasing parkinsonism was unrelated to age, gender, the severity of cognitive deficits, the presence of depression, or use of psychotropic medications. On the other hand, neither the presence of parkinsonism nor depression at baseline was significantly associated with more severe apathy at follow-up.

Yet such interventions are costly to implement, and clear evidence on the optimal time to intervene to yield a high economic and social return in the future is meagre. The majority of successful early childhood interventions start in the preschool years. However socioeconomic gradients in cognitive skills, socio-emotional functioning and health can be observed by age three, suggesting that preventative programmes starting earlier in childhood may be even more effective. We discuss the optimal timing of early childhood intervention with reference to recent research in developmental neuroscience. We motivate the need for early intervention by providing an overview of the impact of adverse risk factors during the antenatal and early childhood periods on outcomes later in life.

From the population of all male Swedish residents born 1973-1976, registered in the census 1985 and with complete test scores from military conscription, the following study groups were identified: Korean adoptees (n = 320), non-Korean adoptees (n = 1,125), siblings (children born by adoptive parents, n = 190) and Swedish majority comparisons (n = 142,024). Global scores from intelligence tests at conscription were compared with grade points from the last compulsory school year (year 9). Linear and logistic regression was applied in statistical analyses. The mean grade points in theoretical subjects were lower in non-Korean adoptees than in the majority population, but when global test scores from military conscription were adjusted for, outcomes were significantly better, equal for physics, than in the majority population. The grade points of Korean adoptees were higher than in the majority population and the same held true after adjusting for global test scores. When SES was taken into account, the risk of poor school performance (only completed lower subject levels) increased in non-Korean adoptees compared to models only adjusted for age and sex.

Evidence shows that African communities, including Uganda, use both modern and traditional healing systems. There is limited literature about the magnitude of psychological distress and associated factors among attendees of traditional healing practices. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of psychological distress among attendees of traditional healing practices in two districts in Uganda. Face-to-face interviews with the Lusoga version of the Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) were carried out with 400 patients over the age of 18 years attending traditional healing in Iganga and Jinja districts in Eastern Uganda. Patients were recruited consecutively in all the traditional healers' shrines that could be visited in the area. Persons with 6 or more positive responses to the SRQ were identified as having psychological distress. Prevalence was estimated and odds ratios of having psychological distress were obtained with multiple logistic regression analysis. 387 questionnaire responses were analyzed. The prevalence of psychological distress in connection with attendance at the traditional healers' shrines was 65.1%. Having a co-wife and having more than four children were significantly associated with psyclogical distress. Among the socioeconomic indicators, lack of food and having debts were significantly associated with psychological distress. The distressed group was more likely to need explanations for ill health. Those who visited both the healer and a health unit were less likely to be distressed. This study provides evidence that a substantial proportion of attendees of traditional healing practices suffer from psychological distress. Associated factors include poverty, number of children, polygamy, reason for visiting the healer and use of both traditional healing and biomedical health units.

A study on the perception of affordance in the elderly].","Marion Luyat, Delphine Domino, Myriam No&#xeb;l","Falls are frequent in the elderly and account for medical complications and loss of autonomy. Affordance, a concept proposed by Gibson, can help to understand a possible cause of falls. An affordance is defined as a potentiality of action offered by the environment in relation with both the properties of this environment and the properties of the organism. Most of our daily activities reflect a perfect adjustment between the perception of these potentialities of action and our actual action abilities. In other words, we correctly perceive affordances. However, in the elderly, postural abilities are reduced and equilibration is more unstable. Thus, some falls could result from a misperception of the affordances of posturability. The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that cognitive overestimation of real postural abilities in the elderly may cause falls. There would be a gap between what the old subjects believe to be able to do and what they actually can do. Fifteen young adults (mean age = 24 years) and fifteen older adults (mean age = 72 years) had to judge if they were able to stand upright on an inclined surface. The exploration of the inclined surface was made in two conditions: visually and also by haptics (without vision with a cane). In a second part, we measured their real postural stance on the inclined surface. The results show that the perceptual judgments were not different among old and young people. However, as expected, the old subjects had lower postural boundaries than the younger. They could stand on lower inclinations of the surface. These results show an involution of the perception of the affordances in aging. They support the hypothesis of a cognitive overestimation of action abilities in the elderly, possibly due to a difficulty to actualize the new limits for action.",2008,12,1,"Psychologie &amp; neuropsychiatrie du vieillissement","10.1684/pnv.2008.0149",NA,"Psychol Neuropsychiatr Vieil","fre","D000058; D000293; D000328; D000368; D000369; D005260; D006801; D008297; D008875; D010465; D011187; D012649; D013028; D055815","Accidental Falls; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Perception; Posture; Self Concept; Space Perception; Young Adult",NA,"NA",NA,"Laboratoire de neurosciences fonctionnelles et pathologies, UMR 8160, Service EFV, H&#xf4;pital Roger Salengro, Universit&#xe9; de Lille."

This review surveys visual HSN, presenting first the means for detection and diagnosis in its manifold variations.

Results indicate that 45.7% of the variance in ratings of whole family functioning was shared among family members, whereas 54.3% was nonshared. Family-level characteristics, such as socioeconomic status (SES), family structure and composition, and family well-being, accounted for 30.6% of between-family variation (i.e., shared perceptions). Individual-level characteristics, such as sex, age, dependent child status, education, and well-being, accounted for 5.6% of within-family variance (i.e., unique perceptions). There was significant between-family variation in the relationship between dependent child status and ratings of family functioning, and increased rating discrepancies among members of the same family were linked with higher levels of family SES. The findings attest to the validity of measuring whole family functioning directly from self-report ratings provided from multiple family members.

Both quantitative and qualitative analytic approaches were used to analyze the transcripts of 36 parents grouped into six focus groups by socioeconomic status (SES) (high, low) and ethnicity (African-American, Caucasian, Hispanic). The quantitative analyses demonstrated that, irrespective of SES and ethnicity, the parents were highly aware of their children's behavioral, emotional, and cognitive difficulties and the lack of knowledge about epilepsy among medical, educational, and mental health professionals. The higher-SES parents were significantly more concerned about inadequate educational services and the need for medical services, but less concerned about mental health and medical service use than the lower-SES parents. Insufficient knowledge about epilepsy and about services, parent emotional difficulties, and use of educational services differed significantly by ethnicity. The qualitative analyses highlighted the parents' concerns regarding misconceptions about epilepsy and the stigma toward mental health care among the African-American and Hispanic parents. These findings suggest the need for accessible and better-quality mental health, educational, and medical services for children with epilepsy irrespective of SES and ethnicity.

Yet, this belief continues to lack empirical support, and this is due in part to measurement issues that have plagued the cultural competency construct. In the present research, we report on the development of a theoretically grounded, generally applicable, and patient report measure of provider cultural competency. Samples of predominantly African American patients (N=310) were recruited from three urban medical clinics to complete a survey about their relationship with their physician. We examined the factor structure, validity and other psychometric characteristics of a newly proposed patient report measure of provider cultural competency. Psychometric analyses supported a tripartite model of cultural competency that was comprised of patient judgments of their physician's cultural knowledge, awareness, and skill. In addition, this result was replicated across multiple clinical contexts, while also demonstrating convergent and incremental validity when correlated with measures of trust, satisfaction and discrimination.

We performed a Medline search including all papers from 1980 to August 2007. In addition to reviewing the articles, we performed meta-analyses on these studies where possible. We identified 18 relevant papers. Only the studies on affected sibling pairs were suitable for meta-analysis. Data from twin and affected sibling studies are consistent with a genetic contribution to the disorganization dimension. However these studies did not unequivocally support a large genetic contribution to neither the reality distortion symptom dimension nor to the psychomotor poverty symptom dimension. In contrast several molecular genetic studies did report associations of genes with psychomotor poverty.

"18308560","Advances in understanding L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.","M A Cenci, H S Lindgren","The crucial role of dopamine (DA) in movement control is illustrated by the spectrum of motor disorders caused by either a deficiency or a hyperactivity of dopaminergic transmission in the basal ganglia. The degeneration of nigrostriatal DA neurons in Parkinson's disease causes poverty and slowness of movement. These symptoms are greatly improved by pharmacological DA replacement with L-3,4-dihydroxy-phenylalanine (L-DOPA), which however causes excessive involuntary movements in a majority of patients. L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (abnormal involuntary movements) provides a topic of investigation at the interface between clinical and basic neuroscience. In this article, we review recent studies in rodent models, which have uncovered two principal alterations at the basis of the movement disorder, namely, an abnormal pre-synaptic handling of exogenous L-DOPA, and a hyper-reactive post-synaptic response to DA. Dysregulated nigrostriatal DA transmission causes secondary alterations in a variety of non-dopaminergic transmitter systems, the manipulation of which modulates dyskinesia through mechanisms that are presently unclear. Further research on L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia will contribute to a deeper understanding of the functional interplay between neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in the motor circuits of the basal ganglia.",2007,12,1,"Current opinion in neurobiology","10.1016/j.conb.2008.01.004",NA,"Curr Opin Neurobiol","eng","D000818; D000978; D004195; D004298; D004409; D006801; D007980; D008959; D009434; D009435","Animals; Antiparkinson Agents; Disease Models, Animal; Dopamine; Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced; Humans; Levodopa; Models, Neurological; Neural Pathways; Synaptic Transmission",NA,"NA",NA,"Basal Ganglia Pathophysiology Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, S-221 84 Lund, Sweden."

No demographic variable was found to be related to child HRQOL, except for marital status, where children from divorced/separated parents had lower HRQOL. However, marital status was not uniquely predictive of HRQOL when neurological and behavioral variables were taken into account. Exploratory analyses indicated that children of separated/divorced parents were more likely to have early epilepsy onset, lower adaptive/developmental levels, and worse seizure frequency, suggesting that severe epilepsy may be a risk factor for marital stress. In sum, contrary to research in other chronic conditions, sociodemographic variables in pediatric epilepsy were weak predictors of HRQOL in comparison to neurological and behavioral variables.

A consecutive series of 168 patients with PD were assessed by neurologists with the UPDRS, and by psychiatrists using a comprehensive neuropsychiatric evaluation blind to each other's ratings. ROC analysis demonstrated that a score of 2 or greater on the intellectual impairment item of the UPDRS had 60% sensitivity and 92% specificity to detect dementia, as diagnosed with DSM-IV criteria. When a score of 23 or lower on the MMSE was included as an additional classification variable, the sensitivity increased to 85%.

In previous research we found that this association shows neural specificity; specifically we found that groups of low and middle SES children differed disproportionately in perisylvian/language and prefrontal/executive abilities relative to other neurocognitive abilities. Here we address several new questions: To what extent does this disparity between groups reflect a gradient of SES-related individual differences in neurocognitive development, as opposed to a more categorical difference? What other neurocognitive systems differ across individuals as a function of SES? Does linguistic ability mediate SES differences in other systems? And how do specific prefrontal/executive subsystems vary with SES?

The scientific knowledge base about prognoses for such absences is very limited, but employers and clinicians often predict them to be very long. The aim of this study was to investigate sickness absence and disability pension in a cohort of employees who initially were on long-term sick leave due to psychiatric disorders, with regard to gender, age, socioeconomic status, and previous sickness absence. The cohort included 4,891 employees in Sweden, who, in 1999 were aged 20-61 and had a new sick-leave spell &gt;90 days with a psychiatric disorder. Retrospective and prospective registry data on sickness absence and DP for 1996-2002 were obtained. Logistic regressions were performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for having a low, intermediate, or high level of sickness absence (&lt;17, 17-90, and 91-365 days, respectively) or DP in 2002. The mean number of sick-leave days per person per year 3 years prior to inclusion was low; 17 days, but had increased to 211 days by 2000. In 2002, 26% had been granted DP, significantly higher rate among men, while a higher rate of the women had long-term sickness absence. Of all 4,891 subjects, 35% had &lt;17 sick-leave days in 2002. The OR of having low, intermediate, or long-term sickness absence decreased with age. The reverse was found for obtaining DP, for which also low socioeconomic status was an independent predictor of an increased risk (OR = 3.40, CI 2.28-5.08). Employees with long-term sick leave due to psychiatric disorders did not have a high level of sickness absence in the 3 years prior to inclusion in the study. Also, 3 years after inclusion, only 35% had very low levels of sickness absence, whereas 26% had been granted DP. Employees who were aged 55-61 showed the lowest risk of sick leave but the highest risk of DP.

The goal of the current investigation was to examine the proportion of genetic and environmental influences on smoking in a sample of adult African-American twins. Birth records from North Carolina Register of Deeds Offices were used to identify participants for the Carolina African-American Twin Study of Aging (CAATSA). Participants completed an in-person interview that included measures of health status, cognition and psychosocial measures. Data for the analysis come from 200 pairs of same-sex twins (97 identical pairs and 113 fraternal), with a mean age = 46.9 years (SD = 13.9) and 38% of the sample being men. Compared to previous research on smoking, our estimates are very similar with genetics, accounting for about 60% of the individual variance in current smoking. We did find that there was a significant amount of genetic variance in pack years but no shared environmental influences. Similarity in proportions of genetic influences lead to larger questions about the genes involved in smoking among African Americans working in the same manner as in Caucasians or other groups. Additionally, this same question holds for the environmental variance. It is perhaps most likely that while the proportions of environmental variance are similar between groups that the actual source of variance (e.g., poverty, urban rural context, socioeconomic status, attitudes of family and friends) may differ when comparing ethnic groups.",2007,3,1,"Journal of the National Medical Association",NA,"PMC2569616","J Natl Med Assoc","eng","D001741; D005260; D014644; D015438; D006306; D006801; D007407; D008297; D008875; D012307; D012309; D012907; D012931; D014427; D014481","Black or African American; Female; Genetic Variation; Health Behavior; Health Surveys; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Risk-Taking; Smoking; Social Environment; Twins; United States","1R01-AG13662-01A2","NA",NA,"Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University, P.O.

This paper describes the methods and rationale behind the study and the general characteristics of the sample. At six different centers, from March 2003 through November 2005, we consecutively recruited 110 patients, ages 9-17 years, who presented with a first psychotic episode. Controls were recruited from the same geographic areas and were matched for gender and age. Patients had lower socioeconomic status (SES) (p=0.018) and parental years of education (p&lt;0.001) than controls. The percentage of patients recruited increased with age (p&lt;0.001) and there was a higher percentage of males (p&lt;0.001). The total mean PANSS score was 89.03+/-20.1, the positive score 23.8+/-6.5 and the negative score 20.02+/-8.8. There were no significant differences between the genders with respect to age, parental years of education, SES, or scores in premorbid adjustment or general functioning. There were statistically significant positive correlations between age and positive symptoms and between all PANSS subscales and the Disability Assessment Schedule, and negative correlations between positive symptoms and global functioning. Diagnoses after the baseline evaluation were: psychotic disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) 35.5%, schizophreniform disorder 24.5%, mood disorder with psychotic symptoms 22.7%, schizophrenia 10%, schizoaffective disorder 2.7%, and other psychotic disorders 4.5%. Patients had worse premorbid adjustment (p&lt;0.001) and global functioning (p&lt;0.001) than controls after controlling for SES.

Event related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during task performance, using 31 electrodes, from 25 subjects with schizophrenia and 25 matched controls. Subjects with schizophrenia had a reduction in parietal P3 and Late Slow Wave amplitude in the ERP waveforms recorded when the task required subjects to remember a new stimulus. This P3 amplitude attenuation correlated with symptom measures of preoccupation and poor volition. Previous findings of a reduction in P3 amplitude during target detection by subjects with schizophrenia were replicated.

One hundred forty-four of a consecutive series of 552 patients with probable AD (26%) reported excessive anxiety and worry difficult to control for most of the 6 months before the psychiatric evaluation. Excessive anxiety and worry were significantly associated with restlessness, irritability, muscle tension, fears, and respiratory symptoms of anxiety. Using these symptoms as diagnostic criteria, 56 of the 552 patients (10%) met revised diagnostic criteria for GAD as compared with 15% when using DSM-IV criteria and 9% when using the ICD-10 criteria. GAD was present in 38 of the 144 patients (26%) with major depression and in 12 of the 261 patients (5%) without depression. Patients with both GAD and depression showed more severe cognitive deficits than patients with either GAD or depression only.

Although knowledge about HIV/AIDS and protective sexual behaviour are linked theoretically, relatively little is known about their empirical relationship. Using Demographic and Health Survey data from 23 low- and middle-income countries, this study used multilevel logistic regression models: to examine cross-national variability in the relationship between HIV/AIDS knowledge and protective behaviour (condom use and restricted sex); to investigate the moderating influences of women's educational attainment on this relationship; and to test the extent to which severity of the HIV/AIDS epidemic accounts for cross-national variability in the association between HIV/AIDS knowledge and protective behaviour. There was an association between increased knowledge of HIV/AIDS and condom use that varied in strength and form cross-nationally. This cross-national variation was accounted for partially by the socioeconomic characteristics of women resident in the study countries and between-country differences in the severity of the HIV epidemic. While education modified the association between HIV/AIDS knowledge and protective behaviour--stronger associations at lower levels of education--epidemic severity exerted a stronger influence on behaviour than any other characteristic. Finally, this study indicates that protective sexual practices are disturbingly low. In eight of 23 countries, overall levels of condom use to prevent STDs and HIV/AIDS were less than 5.0%.

Among 46,901 adults who participated in both surveys, 24,127 persons (51%) in HUNT-2 who reported MSC continuously for at least 3 months during the past year were defined as having chronic MSC. Prevalence of chronic MSC was estimated at nine anatomical sites using multiple logistic regression with odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) as measures of association with SES. When defining SES by educational level, type of occupation, or income, low status was associated with increased prevalence of chronic MSC (age-adjusted analyses). The negative influence of low education or low occupation level was not eliminated by increasing the level of education or occupation from HUNT-1 to HUNT-2, in contrast with what was found for individuals with higher income level in HUNT-2 than in HUNT-1. The relationship with SES was more evident among individuals with musculoskeletal symptoms 15 days during the past month than among those with less than 15 days, evident at all nine different anatomical sites. The strongest relationship was found between low SES and prevalence of widespread chronic MSC. Individuals with low SES had higher prevalence of chronic MSC than those with high SES.

However, modelling human mental disorders in experimental animals is fraught with difficulties. Depression models generally lack both clinical and scientific credibility and have, thus far, failed to inform treatment strategies previously acquired through serendipity. The complexity and heterogeneity of the clinical states labelled 'depression' dictate that we continue to work with a crude and uninformative taxonomy within which 'core' clinical and pathophysiological features of depression are not clearly identified. Consequently, much of the neuroscience of animal modelling is framed around physiological and neurobiological phenomena that may be of relevance to only a minority of patients. Additionally, inferring pathophysiology from apparent treatment responses overestimates the efficacy of existing treatments and tends to ignore reliable demonstrations of the 'antidepressant effects' of non-pharmacological interventions. Whilst animal modelling remains a potentially important approach towards understanding neurobiological mechanisms in depression, we need to address the poverty of reliable clinical science that should inform model development.",2005,1,1,"Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews",NA,NA,"Neurosci Biobehav Rev","eng","D000818; D000928; D002986; D003863; D003866; D004195; D006801; D007206; D011613; D013312","Animals; Antidepressive Agents; Clinical Trials as Topic; Depression; Depressive Disorder; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Individuality; Psychotherapy; Stress, Physiological",NA,"NA",NA,"Division of Pathology and Neuroscience, Department of Psychiatry, University of Dundee, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee DD1 9SY, UK."

This study has investigated the relationship between SES and case fatality, ""death or dependency,"" and ""death or institutional care"" at 6 months after stroke. Patients with acute stroke (n=2709) were identified using routine hospital discharge data and SES was measured using Carstairs scores (an ecological index of social deprivation). Case mix and treatment data were collected by medical chart review, case fatality by record linkage, and functional status and place of residence by questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to adjust the association of social deprivation and outcome for case mix and selected treatment variables. With increasing social deprivation, patients were younger, more likely to live alone, and, on admission, more likely to need help to walk. Social deprivation was not associated with case fatality or with ""death or institutional care"" in any analysis. However, patients residing in the most deprived areas (deprivation categories 6 and 7) were significantly more likely to be dead or dependent than patients from more affluent areas. This association was weakened but remained after adjusting for case mix and treatment variables. These findings contribute to growing evidence of an inverse social gradient in disability after stroke. Institutionalization, as a proxy for functional outcome, may not reflect this fact.

Besides these well-known motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms may develop, such as depression, cognitive impairment and psychosis. Psychotic symptoms constitute a relatively common but nevertheless serious complication, with visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions often being most prominent. These symptoms are important contributors to patient and caregiver distress and are often important risk factors for nursing home placement. Exogenous (related to therapeutic interventions) factors are of major importance but endogenous (related to the disease process itself) factors might also contribute to the development of psychotic symptoms in PD.

A new approach to investigate this interaction in man is combining acoustic stimulation activating the startle system with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the motor cortex. However, it is unclear whether the inhibition of TMS responses following acoustic stimulation occurs at the level of the motor cortex through reticulo-cortical projections or subcortically, perhaps through reticulo-spinal projections. We compared the influence of acoustic stimulation on motor effects elicited by TMS over motor cortical areas to those evoked with subcortical electrical stimulation (SES) through depth electrodes in five patients treated with deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease. SES bypasses the motor cortex, demonstrating any interaction with acoustic stimuli at the subcortical level. EMG was recorded from the contralateral biceps brachii muscle. Acoustic stimulation was delivered binaurally through headphones and used as a conditioning stimulus at an interstimulus interval of 50 ms.

However, little is known about the burden of stroke in sub-Saharan Africa. We investigated the prevalence of stroke survivors in the Agincourt Health and Population Unit, a demographic surveillance site in the rural northeast of South Africa. Census workers asked household informants 2 screening questions for stroke during the annual census. If either question was answered positively, a clinician visited individuals aged &gt; or =15 years to confirm the likely diagnosis of stroke. We performed a detailed assessment and defined stroke according to the World Health Organization criteria. A total of 42 378 individuals were aged &gt; or =15 years. There were 982 positive responses to the questionnaire, and we examined 724 individuals (74%). We identified 103 strokes (crude prevalence, 243/100 000). After adjustment for those we did not examine, the prevalence was 300/100 000 (95% CI, 250 to 357). Sixty-six percent of stroke survivors needed help with at least 1 activity of daily living (Segi age-standardized prevalence, 200/100 000). Stroke prevalence in rural South Africa is higher than previously documented in Africa but lower than in high-income countries. However, the prevalence of stroke survivors requiring help with at least 1 activity of daily living is already at high-income country levels.

"14962631","Socioeconomic status and health: a neurobiological perspective.","Jean-Pierre Roy","Socioeconomic status (SES) is one of the strongest predictors of health in industrial nations. This is especially true of societies with large disparities between rich and poor. Evidence suggests that the interactions between individuals of different SES play a crucial role in mediating the effects of SES on health. The question is why? Because humans are extremely social animals, their sense of well being is to a large extent determined by their social interactions. In hierarchical societies, individuals at every level of the hierarchy have to submit to those above and the recognition of this submissiveness generates emotions such as shame, anger and depression. These emotions lead to the activation of physiological alarm systems such as the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system. The chronic activation of these systems alter their set points. This results in changes in the systems' different target organs responsible for diseases such as adult onset diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, major depression and autoimmune diseases. Recent evidence from neurobiology show that one brain area, the amygdala, plays a pivotal role in processing social emotions. Anatomical and physiological studies of the amygdala in animals show how this area could play the central role in activating the alarm systems. This recent evidence brings a deeper level of plausibility to the postulated mechanisms of activation of the alarm systems by social emotions. Other experimental evidence also shed more light on the pathways responsible for translating psychosocial experiences into physiological perturbations.",2004,1,1,"Medical hypotheses",NA,NA,"Med Hypotheses","eng","D000679; D001921; D004644; D006304; D006801; D001523; D009446; D012923","Amygdala; Brain; Emotions; Health Status; Humans; Mental Disorders; Neurobiology; Social Class",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Canada."

Symptoms were rated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) in 105 chronic patients with schizophrenia. Principal-component analysis (PCA) produced a five-factor solution for the PANSS (psychomotor poverty, disorganisation, reality distortion, excitement, and depression), and a two-factor solution for the MADRS (psychological and behavioural depression). The PANSS depression factor was highly associated with the MADRS psychological depression factor but not with MADRS behavioural depression. By contrast, the PANSS excitement factor showed a strong positive correlation with the behavioural depression factor but not with psychological depression.

One such subprocess could be the active orientation of attention to significant or novel stimuli. In this study, we used skin conductance responses (SCRs) to index orienting responses (ORs). ERP activity was examined in relation to concomitant ORs in a schizophrenia and nonpsychiatric control group. Schizophrenia responses were considered with respect to the Reality Distortion, Disorganisation and Psychomotor Poverty syndromes. Forty schizophrenia and 40 age and sex matched control subjects were tested. The three schizophrenia syndromes were derived from a principal component analysis of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) ratings. Auditory ERPs (N100, N200, P200, P300) were elicited using a conventional auditory oddball paradigm, and electrodermal SCR data were acquired simultaneously. ERP data were sub-averaged according to the presence/absence of an OR. For both 'with-' and 'without-OR' ERPs, schizophrenia subjects as a group showed reduced N100 (associated with vigilance level) and N200 (associated with response selection) amplitude, and for with-OR responses, they showed an additional reduction in P300 (context processing). Concerning schizophrenia syndromes, Reality Distortion was related primarily to frontal disturbances (earlier N100/N200 latency and decreased P200/P300 amplitude), and Psychomotor Poverty to a generally delayed P300 latency. Similarly delayed P300 in Disorganisation was explained by medication effects. There were no associations with syndromes for without-OR ERPs. These results suggest that schizophrenia syndromes are dissociated with regard to both the direction and nature of speed of information processing disturbances, in relation to task-relevant information that produces active orientation.",2003,2,1,"Schizophrenia research",NA,NA,"Schizophr Res","eng","D000293; D000328; D005071; D005260; D005625; D005712; D006801; D008297; D008875; D011601; D012559; D012720; D011795","Adolescent; Adult; Evoked Potentials; Female; Frontal Lobe; Galvanic Skin Response; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychophysics; Schizophrenia; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires",NA,"NA",NA,"Cognitive Neuroscience Unit, Department of Psychology, University of Sydney, Sydney NSW 2006, Australia."

In the present study we established the 5-min nighttime profiles in various measures of heart rate variability (HRV) in one patient with primary aldosteronism before and after successful surgery of Conn adenoma. One patient (female, 36 years old) with primary aldosteronism underwent two experimental nights a few weeks before and after surgery by coeliscopy in which sleep and cardiac recordings were made. Power spectral analysis was performed on ectopic-free R-R intervals with a fast Fourier transform. We calculated also the standard deviation of normal R-R intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square difference among successive R-R intervals (RMSSD). While removal of adenoma resulted in a rapid complete normalization of blood pressure and classical signs and biological symptoms of aldosterone hypersecretion, HRV profile did not changed a few weeks after surgery. The overnight SDNN was low although not abnormal at 38 and 33 ms before and after surgery respectively vs 58 +/- 15 ms (33 to 83) in normal female controls. RMSSD was low although not abnormal at 33 and 31 ms before and after surgery respectively vs 60 +/- 20 ms (20 to 105).

"11521962","The importance of neurobiological research to the prevention of psychopathology.","D Fishbein","There is both a biological and environmental component to the neural substrates for various forms of psychopathology. Brain dysfunction itself not only constitutes a formidable liability to psychopathology, but also has an impact on environmental and social responses to the individual, compounding the risk for an adverse outcome. Environmental conditions, such as social and physical stimulus deprivation, poverty, traumatic stress, and prenatal drug exposure, can further compromise brain function in the context of existing liabilities. The relationship between genetic and environmental processes is interactive, fluid, and cumulative in their ability to influence an individual's developmental trajectory and alter subsequent behavioral outcomes. Given the codependent relationship between these processes, brain function is now believed to be malleable via manipulations of the environment in ways that may decrease liability for psychopathology. Research that explores these relationships and ways in which interventions can redirect this developmental track may substantially advance both the science and practice of prevention. Studies attempting to isolate the neurobiological effects of socioenvironmental factors are reviewed, implications for intervention strategies are discussed, and a future research agenda is proposed to provide greater insight into specific brain-environment relationships.

However, the association between SPEM dysfunction and particular clinical symptoms remains unclear. We examined SPEM dysfunction in relation to schizophrenic symptoms using both the positive/negative dichotomy and the three-syndrome model. Subjects included 78 patients with schizophrenia and 60 healthy control subjects. SPEM performance was indexed by root mean square error. Symptom profiles were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and the three-primary syndromes were identified by factor analysis of PANSS ratings (Psychomotor poverty: deficit negative symptoms; Disorganization: defined primarily by thought disorder; and Reality distortion: hallucinations and delusions). Compared with controls, the schizophrenia group showed significant impairment in global SPEM function. The three-syndrome approach produced more specific findings than the dichotomous model. Of the three syndromes, only the Disorganization dimension showed a significant association with increased global SPEM dysfunction. The specificity of SPEM dysfunction to Disorganization was verified in comparisons among schizophrenia subgroups and the control group.

"11098724","[An animal model of human declarative (relational) memory and of its dysfunction].","R Jaffard, N Etchamendy, A Desmedt, A Krazem, C Cortes-Torrea, A Marighetto","The present work was aimed at determining, both at the psychological and at the neurobiological levels, aspects of rodent memory that fall into line with human declarative memory which is known to be selectively impaired in amnesic subjects and during the course of ageing. The ability to compare and to contrast items in memory, and to support inferential use of memories in novel situations (flexibility), were considered to be the two key psychological features of human declarative memory that were altered by both hippocampal lesions and hippocampal dysfunction. Adult and aged mice were trained on learning tasks using two-stage paradigms, the aim of which was to assess memory performance through these two psychological aspects in the same subjects. Results suggest that ageing specifically impairs the ability to both compare and contrast items in memory (declarative/relational memory based on complex associations), without altering memory based on simple S-R associations (procedural memory). Hippocampal lesions in adult mice produced the same dissociation between relational memory (impaired) and procedural memory (spared). Pharmacological experiments showed that, depending on the drug used, the relational memory deficit of aged mice may be selectively reversed (i.e. without changes in procedural memory) and that the behavioural efficacy of certain treatments was shown to parallel their potency in re-establishing normal (i.e. adult) levels of hippocampal plasticity-related mechanisms. Together with previous findings, these results suggest that the storage and use of relational representations would critically depend on the plasticity of hippocampal synapses, which via their connections with cortical areas, would support the storage of associations between perceptual, behavioral and cognitive events.",2000,1,1,"Therapie",NA,NA,"Therapie","fre","D000818; D004195; D006801; D008568; D008569; D051379; D051381","Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Memory; Memory Disorders; Mice; Rats",NA,"NA",NA,"Laboratoire de Neurosciences Cognitives, CNRS UMR 5106, Universit&#xe9; de Bordeaux 1, Talence, France."
"10884961","Baby and the brain: advances in child development.","J A DiPietro","As child morbidity and mortality declined during the twentieth century, a corresponding increase occurred in the relevance of child psychological well-being to public health. Evidence of this trend is the proliferation of programs intended to ameliorate conditions that place children in jeopardy of poor developmental outcome. Most recently, neurobiologic information on brain function and structure has been used to promote strategies for optimizing child development. This review will evaluate the current state of knowledge relating early child development to brain research and illustrate the potential misuse of this information. It will also suggest the following: (a) the extrapolation of neuroscience results to early academic and social enrichment programs obscures the magnitude of potential effects of these programs relative to the vast burden of risk imposed by poverty, and (b) an emphasis on intellectual functioning misses the most compelling evidence on the role of the early social environment in mediating establishment of neural networks that regulate a child's response to stress and capacity for self-control.",2000,1,1,"Annual review of public health",NA,NA,"Annu Rev Public Health","eng","D001921; D002648; D002657; D002669; D003467; D015509; D002658; D018479; D006801; D007231; D009415; D009488; D011203; D002666; D011634; D012307; D012931","Brain; Child; Child Development; Child Welfare; Cultural Deprivation; Developmental Biology; Developmental Disabilities; Early Intervention, Educational; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Nerve Net; Neurosciences; Poverty; Psychology, Child; Public Health; Risk Factors; Social Environment",NA,"NA",NA,"Department of Population and Family Health Sciences, School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA."

After exploration, I was invited to attend their reunion to facilitate some of the discussion of former residents who were ""welcomed home"" from various parts of the country. The participants expressed a wide range of emotions as they rediscovered one another--sometimes from childhood memory, sometimes contrasting childhood faces in old photos with the faces of people now present in middle or old age. As the group reminisced, one man told of his calling out the home's upper-story window each evening to his older sister who lived a floor below. He recalled his sadness on the day when there was silence in response, as she had been sent to a foster home. A woman ""alumni"" sang word for word, with others joining in, an old Christian hymn that they had sung decades before. And, an elderly woman described how the church across the street from the original children's home facility on tenth street, had a large stain glass window depicting the outstretched arms of God. She told how every night, when it was time for her to go to bed, the window would be lit up. Movingly, she related how she would lie in her bed and look through the window of her room, feeling ""held"" until she fell asleep. Over the many months that followed, men and women who had been institutionalized there throughout childhood entrusted to me their life stories. This article is a summary of their narratives.

"10644776","Neurocysticercosis and epilepsy in developing countries.","D K Pal, A Carpio, J W Sander","Neurocysticercosis is a disease of poverty and underdevelopment. Little is known about the natural history of the infection in humans, but some of the mechanisms whereby the parasite remains silent and evades the host immune response are understood. Symptomatic neurocysticercosis usually results from host inflammatory response after parasite death, and the clinical manifestations can be diverse. There is no evidence that cysticidal treatment does more good than harm in addition to conventional antiepileptic treatment. Population control measures involving immunisation or mass treatment have not shown long term effectiveness.Epilepsy, similarly to neurocysticercosis, is a largely unrecognised but increasing burden on the welfare and economies of developing countries. The technology of drug treatment and psychosocial rehabilitation is well known but requires widespread and effective dissemination at low cost. There is little epidemiological data on risk factors for epilepsy in developing countries on which to base prevention strategies. The public health prioritisation of chronic disorders such as epilepsy remains a challenge for policy and practice in developing countries. For both neurocysticercosis and epilepsy, there is a dilemma about whether limited public resources would better be spent on general economic development, which would be expected to have a broad impact on the health and welfare of communities, or on specific programmes to help individual affected people with neurocysticercosis and epilepsy.

The sample studied comprised 101 children (53 low scorers and 48 controls) originally from a total population of 2783 children assessed by their parents at 18 months using a screening instrument. Data were analysed by logistic regression. The results yielded moderate but statistically significant correlations between predictor and outcome variables. Optimality score and maternal education were the best predictors of developmental delay at 18 months. At 8 years, parental assessment score and maternal education constituted the best predictors of school achievement problems. At 14 years, SES together with parental assessment score were included in the model, when school achievement problems were predicted. Parental assessment score showed the strongest association with school achievement problems at both 8 and 14 years, when children with intellectual disability were included in the analysis. The exclusion of children with intellectual disability from the analyses yielded a stronger association between maternal education (at 8 years) and SES (at 14 years) and school achievement problems. The overall classification accuracy of the models varied between 67% and 88%. Specificity varied from 65% at 18 months to 95% at 14 years.

One hundred ninety-five women all attending a hospital-based epilepsy clinic were recruited. One hundred fifty-nine received AED therapy and 36 women did not. A control group of 48 women was also recruited. All women completed the first two Sexuality Experience Scales (SES 1 and SES 2), and those women in stable heterosexual relationships completed SES 3 and SES 4. At the same time blood was taken for TT and SHBG levels. FT was calculated using the method of Nanjee and Wheeler (22). Women receiving AED therapy achieved significantly higher SES 1 and SES 2 scores than the rest of the women, suggesting that they adhered to a stricter sexual morality and were less open to psychosexual stimulation than the rest of the women treated. Women in the treated group were less likely to have received further education than the controls, a factor that influences SES 1 and SES 2 scores. There were no significant differences between the three groups on SES 3 or SES 4, with the exception of the orgasmic adequacy (OE) scale of SES 3 where those women in the treated group attained a higher mean score than the controls, suggesting that they found orgasm less satisfying. Women receiving AEDs had significantly higher SHBG and TT than controls and untreated patients. There were no differences in FT between the groups. Those women receiving AEDs also exhibited the expected midcycle rise in FT. There was no significant correlation between FT and the desired frequency of intercourse or enjoyment of it for the three groups. Women in the treated group appeared to be more ""moral"" and less open to sexual approach, but those who had regular partners appeared to desire and enjoy intercourse as much as the control and untreated groups. This could be explained by differences in demographic characteristics of the study groups or be indicative of a bimodal distribution of sexual interest in these women.
