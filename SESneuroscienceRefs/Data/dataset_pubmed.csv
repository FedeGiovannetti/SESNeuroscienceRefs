However, there is limited understanding on how different types of poverty may affect children of various immigration backgrounds differently in outcomes such as school readiness. This study examined these relationships between household and/or neighbourhood poverty, poverty timing, and immigration background with school readiness outcomes at kindergarten. This study utilized a retrospective, population-based cohort of administrative records linked with surveys completed by kindergarten teachers for 15&#xa0;369 children born in British Columbia, Canada. The exposures investigated were neighbourhood poverty (residing in a neighbourhood in the lowest income-quintile) and/or household poverty (receiving a health insurance subsidy due to low household income). Experiencing both neighbourhood and household poverty simultaneously was defined as ""combined"" household and neighbourhood poverty. The outcome of vulnerability on school readiness domains was assessed at kindergarten (47.8% female; mean age&#xa0;=&#xa0;6.01 years) using teacher ratings on the Early Development Instrument (EDI). Children exposed to combined poverty between age 0 and 2 had greater odds of being vulnerable in two or more domains of school readiness than children not exposed to any poverty during this period (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.07, 95% CI: [1.74; 2.47], p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). The effect of combined poverty was larger than household poverty only (aOR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.54, 95% CI: [1.31; 1.82], p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) or neighbourhood poverty only (aOR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.49, 95% CI: [1.30; 1.70], p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). Combined poverty was associated with negative outcomes regardless of timing. Both non-immigrants (aOR&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.40, 95% CI: [1.92; 3.00], p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and second-generation immigrants (aOR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.63, 95% CI: [1.22; 2.17], p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) experiencing combined poverty scored lower on school readiness.

For example, one in three Black children lives in poverty (versus one in nine white children), and, on average, Black Americans live four fewer years compared with white Americans. Which disparity is more likely to spark reduction efforts? We find that highlighting disparities in health-related (versus economic) outcomes spurs greater social media engagement and support for disparity-mitigating policy. Further, reading about racial health disparities elicits greater support for action (e.g., protesting) compared with economic- or belonging-based disparities. This occurs in part because people view health disparities as violating morally sacred values, which enhances perceived injustice.

Due to limited existing services and substantial barriers to accessing care, they often lack support. Caregiver empowerment could help address injustices that hinder their capacity to support their child as they would like. The aim of this study was to explore the meaning and potential role of empowerment for caregivers raising a child with a DD and how empowerment was situated in relation to other priorities in service development. This was a qualitative phenomenological study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in Amharic and English with caregivers of children with a DD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15), clinicians (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11), community-based health extension workers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5), representatives of non-governmental organisations working with families with DDs (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17), and representatives of local authorities in health, education, and social care (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15). Data were analysed thematically. Three main themes were developed: ""Barriers to exercising caregivers' agency""; ""Whose decision is it to initiate empowerment?""; and ""Supporting caregivers through support groups"". Caregiver capacity to do what they thought was best for their child was undermined by poverty, a sense of hopelessness, experience of domestic abuse and multiple burdens experienced by those who were single mothers. Caregivers were nonetheless active in seeking to bring about change for their children. Caregivers and professionals considered support groups to be instrumental in facilitating empowerment. Participants reflected that caregiver-focused interventions could contribute to increasing caregivers' capacity to exercise their agency. A tension existed between a focus on individualistic notions of empowerment from some professionals compared to a focus on recognising expertise by experience identified as vital by caregivers. Power dynamics in the context of external funding of empowerment programmes could paradoxically disempower. Caregivers of children with DDs in Ethiopia are disempowered through poverty, stigma, and poor access to information and resources. Shifting power to caregivers and increasing their access to opportunities should be done on their own terms and in response to their prioritised needs.","D002648; D006801; D017028; D002658; D005002; D036301; D012657","Child; Humans; Caregivers; Developmental Disabilities; Ethiopia; Qualitative Research; Self-Help Groups","1658511; ES/P000703/1; NIHR200842; NIHR200842; NIHR134325; 222154/Z20/Z; 223615/Z/21/Z","10.18357/ijcyfs94201818645; 10.1177/1049732314552455; 10.1016/j.rasd.2008.04.006; 10.1007/s10826-011-9506-8; 10.1080/1366825021000008657; 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2005.00732.x; 10.1007/s10803-007-0512-z; 10.1111/jar.12209; 10.1111/j.1365-2214.2006.00644.x; 10.1007/s10803-018-3835-z; 10.1155/2016/3501910; 10.1016/j.ridd.2021.104123; 10.1192/bjo.2018.39; 10.1007/s10803-020-04557-6; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113034; 10.1186/s12991-018-0212-4; 10.3402/gha.v7.25447; 10.1017/gmh.2016.17; 10.1037/ort0000249; 10.1177/1362361317730298; 10.1177/1362361319848532; 10.1093/heapro/16.2.179; 10.1093/cdj/bss031; 10.1037/a0018854; 10.1080/01436590500235603; 10.1093/cdj/36.2.134; 10.1002/jcop.20113; 10.5014/ajot.2021.045526; 10.1093/inthealth/ihs037; 10.1007/s10826-014-0004-7; 10.1016/j.ridd.2011.01.037; 10.1371/journal.pone.0229851; 10.4102/ajod.v9i0.705; 10.1016/j.pec.2018.07.026; 10.1111/j.1365-2524.2010.00976.x; 10.1093/heapol/czz025; 10.1002/cl2.1070; 10.1080/00207411.2019.1629264; 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005799; 10.1007/S40037-019-0509-2; 10.1186/s12913-022-07889-4; 10.1186/s13033-017-0144-4; 10.1186/s13033-019-0268-9; 10.7748/nr2013.03.20.4.12.e326; 10.1186/s12913-016-1383-9; 10.1186/s13033-017-0121-y; 10.1080/13645570701401305; 10.1177/1525822X05279903; 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; 10.1177/070674370505000206; 10.1093/intqhc/mzm042; 10.1037/h0089739; 10.1177/1362361311422708; 10.1007/s40615-019-00575-y; 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60685-6; 10.2147/IJGM.S369408; 10.2147/PHMT.S344715; 10.1111/j.1471-0366.2012.00377.x; 10.2471/BLT.15.168252; 10.1257/jep.21.1.141; 10.1371/journal.pone.0232217; 10.1097/YCO.0000000000000506","The authors declare no competing interests.","Zsofia Szlamka, Ikram Ahmed, Elisa Genovesi, Mersha Kinfe, Rosa A Hoekstra, Charlotte Hanlon","Department of Health Service and Population Research, Institute of Psychiatry, Centre for Global Mental Health, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."

Research prior to the pandemic suggests that women may be more at risk of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) due to unmet expectations of their childbirth plans. Therefore, this study aimed to examine if the mismatch between women's planned birth and actual birth experiences during COVID-19 was associated with women's postpartum PTSS. Women in the postpartum period (up to 6&#xa0;months after birth) across 11 countries reported on childbirth experiences, mental health, COVID-19-related factors, and PTSS (PTSD checklist DSM-5 version) using self-report questionnaires (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04595123). More than half (64%) of the 3532 postpartum women included in the analysis reported changes to their childbirth plans. All changes were significantly associated with PTSS scores.

This aim will be achieved by addressing four objectives: (1) develop a conceptual framework that identifies the causal mechanisms linking poverty, self-regulation and depression and anxiety; (2) develop a multi-component selective prevention intervention targeting self-regulation and poverty among adolescents at high risk of developing depression or anxiety; (3) adapt and validate instruments to measure incidence of depression and anxiety, mediators and implementation parameters of the prevention intervention; and (4) undertake a four-arm pilot cluster randomised controlled trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability and cost of the selective prevention intervention in the three study sites. The contributions of this study include the active engagement and participation of adolescents in the research process; a focus on the causal mechanisms of the intervention; building an evidence base for prevention interventions in LMICs; and the use of an interdisciplinary approach. By developing and evaluating an intervention that addresses multidimensional poverty and self-regulation, ALIVE can make contributions to evidence on the integration of mental health into broader development policy and practice.","D000293; D006801; D001007; D003105; D003863; D000075762; D009390; D011203; D000068356; D013019","Adolescent; Humans; Anxiety; Colombia; Depression; Interdisciplinary Research; Nepal; Poverty; Self-Control; South Africa",NA,"NA",NA,"Crick Lund, Mark J D Jordans, Emily Garman, Ricardo Araya, Mauricio Avendano, Annette Bauer, Vikram Bahure, Tarun Dua, Georgia Eleftheriou,  ..., Paula Yarrow","Waves for Change, Cape Town, South Africa."

We characterize linguistic findings in individuals with schizophrenia based on the current literature, including findings relevant for differential and early diagnosis. Review of literature published via PubMed search between January 2010 and May 2022. A total of 143 articles were included. In persons with schizophrenia, language-related alterations can occur at all linguistic levels. Differentiating from findings in persons with affective disorders, typical symptoms in those with schizophrenia mainly include so-called ""poverty of speech,"" reduced word and sentence production, impaired processing of complex syntax, pragmatic language deficits as well as reduced semantic verbal fluency. At the at-risk state, ""poverty of content,"" pragmatic difficulties and reduced verbal fluency could be of predictive value. The current results support multilevel alterations of the language system in persons with schizophrenia. Creative expressions of psychotic experiences are frequently found but are not in the focus of this review. Clinical examinations of linguistic alterations can support differential diagnostics and early detection. Computational methods (Natural Language Processing) may improve the precision of corresponding diagnostics.

We evaluated the long-term interplay of the crisis and these factors with substance use difficulties five years after the crisis onset. A household probability sample of 1970 adults living in Flint during the crisis was surveyed about their crisis experiences, use of substances since the crisis, and risk/resilience factors, including prior potentially traumatic event exposure and current social support. Analyses were weighted to produce population-representative estimates. Of the survey respondents, 17.0% reported that substance use since the crisis contributed to problems with their home, work, or social lives, including 11.2% who used despite a doctor's warnings that it would harm their health, 12.3% who used while working or going to school, and 10.7% who experienced blackouts after heavy use. A total of 61.6% of respondents reported using alcohol since the crisis, 32.4% using cannabis, and 5.2% using heroin, methamphetamine, or non-prescribed prescription opioids. Respondents who believed that exposure to contaminated water harmed their physical health were more likely to use substances to the detriment of their daily lives (RR = 1.32, 95%CI: 1.03-1.70), as were respondents with prior potentially traumatic exposure (RR = 2.99, 95%CI: 1.90-4.71), low social support (RR = 1.94, 95%CI: 1.41-2.66), and PTSD and depression (RR's of 1.78 and 1.49, respectively, <i>p</i>-values &lt; 0.01).

The aim of this study was to examine impact of the pandemic on mental health care and people with mental health conditions in Ethiopia. A convergent mixed methods study was conducted. We systematically mapped information from publicly available reports on impacts of the pandemic on mental health care. Monthly service utilisation data were obtained from Amanuel Mental Specialised Hospital, the main psychiatric hospital, and analysed using segmented Poisson regression (2019 vs. 2020). In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 purposively selected key informants. Framework analysis was used for qualitative data. Findings from each data source were integrated. In the early stages of the pandemic, participants indicated a minimal response towards the mental health aspects of COVID-19. Mental health-related stigma and discrimination was evident. Scarce mental health service settings were diverted to become COVID-19 treatment centres. Mental health care became narrowly biomedical with poorer quality of care due to infrequent follow-up. Households of people with pre-existing mental health conditions in the community reported worsening poverty and decreased access to care due to restricted movement, decreased availability and fear. Lack of reliable medication supplies increased relapse and the chance of becoming chained at home, abandoned or homeless. Caregiver burden was exacerbated. Within mental health facilities, prisons and residential units, infection control procedures did not adequately safeguard those with mental health conditions. Meanwhile, the needs of people with mental health conditions in COVID-19 quarantine and treatment facilities were systematically neglected. Only late in the day were integrated services developed to address both physical and mental health needs.

There is currently little evidence about the impact of incorporating a mental health intervention within an existing public cash transfer program to address poverty, and this project aims to develop and pilot a mental health support intervention embedded within the human capital program to achieve better outcomes among beneficiaries, especially those displaced by conflict and the most socioeconomically vulnerable. The study will consist of three phases: semi-structured one-to-one interviews, co-design and adaptations of the proposed intervention with participants and pilot of the digital intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy and transdiagnostic techniques to determine its feasibility, acceptability, efficacy, and usefulness in 'real settings'. Results will inform if the intervention improves clinical, educational and employment prospects among those who use it. Knowledge will be generated on whether the mental health intervention could potentially improve young people's mental health and human capital in conflict-affected areas? We will evaluate of the impact of potential mental health improvements on human capital outcomes, including educational and employment outcomes. Findings will help to make conclusions about the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, and it will assess its effectiveness to improve the mental health and human capital outcomes of beneficiaries.

To explore clinician-reported and patient-reported inequities between patients under the poverty threshold vs. the others. 916 patients consecutively recruited in 10 national centers received a comprehensive standardized evaluation of illness severity, addictions and patient-reported outcomes. 739 (80.7%) of the patients were classified in the poverty group. This group had poorer objective illness outcomes (lower positive, negative, cognitive, excitement/aggressive and self-neglect symptoms and lifetime history of planned suicide) in multivariate analyses. While they had similar access to treatments and psychotherapy, they had lower access to socially useful activities, couple's life, housing and parenthood. They had also more disturbed metabolic parameters. On the contrary, the poverty group reported better self-esteem. No significant difference for depression, risky health behavior including addictions and sedentary behavior was found. The equity in access to care is attributed to the French social system. However, mental and physical health remain poorer in these patients, and they still experience poor access to social roles independently of illness severity and despite healthcare interventions. These patients may have paradoxically better self-esteem due to decreased contact with society and therefore lower stigma exposure (especially at work). Schizophrenia presents itself as a distinct impoverished population concerning health-related outcomes and social integration, warranting focus in public health initiatives and improved treatment, including tailored interventions, collaborative care models, accessible mental health services, housing support, vocational training and employment support, community integration, education and awareness, research and data collection, culturally competent approaches, and long-term support.","D006801; D012559; D004651; D057545; D011203","Humans; Schizophrenia; Employment; Social Stigma; Poverty",NA,"10.1177/1403494819848276; 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2017.11.020; 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31869-X; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.2299; 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.109877; 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.11.006; 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.08.024; 10.1017/S2045796020000785; 10.1192/bjp.2020.143; 10.1186/s13033-020-00348-9; 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.109927; 10.1016/j.encep.2018.07.007; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2015.05.004; 10.1093/schbul/13.2.261; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1994.tb01487.x; 10.1192/bjp.124.5.460; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2000.tb10933.x; 10.1093/schbul/sbu001; 10.1016/j.schres.2016.10.023; 10.1080/09638288.2017.1312568; 10.1136/bjsports-2020-102955; 10.1016/j.schres.2010.05.019; 10.1186/s13034-017-0207-y; 10.1037//0022-3514.63.3.452; 10.1016/S0895-4356(00)00314-0; 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2019.01.003; 10.1192/bjp.2018.87; 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000455; 10.1037/0278-6133.27.5.576; 10.1002/oby.21716; 10.1093/aje/kwf182; 10.1037/bul0000258; 10.1176/appi.ps.201400073; 10.1093/schbul/sbaa181; 10.4088/JCP.20m13732; 10.1016/j.schres.2020.07.017; 10.1093/schbul/sbaa153","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","Guillaume B Fond, Dong Keon Yon, Bach Tran, Jasmina Mallet, Mathieu Urbach, Sylvain Leignier, Romain Rey, David Misdrahi, Pierre-Michel Llorca,  ..., Laurent Boyer","Fondation FondaMental, Cr&#xe9;teil, France."

Here, we take a data-driven approach to exploring how measures of children's environments relate to the development of their brain structure and function in a community sample of children between the ages of 4 and 10 years. We constructed exposomes including measures of family socioeconomic status, children's exposure to adversity, and geocoded measures of neighborhood socioeconomic status, crime, and environmental toxins. We connected the exposome to two structural measures (cortical thickness and surface area, <i>n</i> = 170) and two functional measures (participation coefficient and clustering coefficient, <i>n</i> = 130). We found dense connections <i>within</i> exposome and brain layers and sparse connections <i>between</i> exposome and brain layers. Lower family income was associated with thinner visual cortex, consistent with the theory that accelerated development is detectable in early-developing regions. Greater neighborhood incidence of high blood lead levels was associated with greater segregation of the default mode network, consistent with evidence that toxins are deposited into the brain along the midline.

AMS aim to enable timely initiation of pharmacologic treatment, build hospital capacity to support patients who use substances, and facilitate transition to community services. As an emerging service being adopted in hospitals across North America, the model of care, populations served, substance use trends, and clinical trajectory has not been widely described. This work aims to characterize patients accessing care through the AMS, establishing predictors for clinical trajectories in hospital including patient-initiated discharge (PID) and hospital re-admission. Using a retrospective cohort design, we describe all patients seen by the AMS between 2018 and 2022 across four hospitals in Hamilton, Ontario. Patients seen by AMS were hospitalized and qualified for a SUD based on DSM-V criteria. The study used descriptive statistics to describe the cohort, where appropriate adjusted time-to-event survival models were constructed to identify predictors for hospital re-admission. Patients seen by the AMS (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;695) frequently lacked access to primary care (47.0&#xa0;%) and less than half (44.3&#xa0;%) were receiving community addiction services on admission. The majority met criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD), with injecting being the primary consumption route (54.8&#xa0;%). Patients exhibited high acuity, with 34.2&#xa0;% requiring critical care measures. Provision of OAT substantially increased to 77.9&#xa0;% of patients (29&#xa0;% on admission). PID occurred in 17.8&#xa0;% of patients and was significantly associated with an admitting diagnosis of suicidal ideation, infection, heart failure, and distinct substance use profiles including methamphetamine, fentanyl, and heroin use (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). PID conferred a 66&#xa0;% increased risk for re-admission (Hazard-Ratio: 1.66; 95&#xa0;% CI: 1.08, 2.54; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02). Patients served by AMS primarily include individuals with OUD presenting with the associated medical complications and substantial deficits in the social determinants of health (e.g., high housing insecurity, poverty, and disability). PID occurs among 1 in 5 people and is associated with higher rates of re-admission. By identifying individuals at higher risk of adverse outcomes, these results provide an opportunity to improve outcomes in this high-risk, high-vulnerability population.",NA,NA,NA,"NA","Declaration of competing interest All authors have no conflict of interest to declare.","Leslie J Martin, Monica Bawor, Supriya Bains, Jacinda Burns, Saba Khoshroo, Myra Massey, Jane DeJesus, Robin Lennox, Lauren Cook-Chaimowitz,  ..., Brittany B Dennis","Department of Medicine, Michael G.

Children in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC)-particularly those affected by poverty, armed conflict, and forced migration-may be at increased risk of maltreatment due to heightened parental distress and disruptions to social support networks. Parenting interventions have been shown to reduce the risk of child maltreatment as well as improve a range of caregiver and child outcomes, yet large-scale implementation remains limited in low-resource displacement settings. This study will examine the impact of an entertainment-education narrative film intervention on reducing physical and emotional abuse and increasing positive parenting among migrant and displaced families from Myanmar living in Thailand. The study is a pragmatic, superiority cluster randomized controlled trial with approximately 40 communities randomized to the intervention or treatment as usual arms in a 1:1 ratio. Participating families in the intervention arm will be invited to attend a community screening of the film intervention and a post-screening discussion, as well as receive a poster depicting key messages from the film. Primary outcomes are changes in physical abuse, emotional abuse, and positive parenting behaviour. Secondary outcomes include caregiver knowledge of positive parenting, caregiver attitudes towards harsh punishment, caregiver psychological distress, and family functioning. Outcomes will be assessed at 3 time points: baseline, 4 weeks post-intervention, and 4-month follow up. A mixed methods process evaluation will be embedded within the trial to assess intervention delivery, acceptability, perceived impacts, and potential mechanisms of change. To our knowledge, this study will be the first randomized controlled trial evaluation of a film-based intervention to reduce child maltreatment among migrant and displaced families in a LMIC. An integrated knowledge translation approach will inform uptake of study findings and application to potential scale up pending evaluation results.

However, the associations between sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances, social disadvantage during pregnancy, and neonatal brain structure remains poorly understood. The current study explored the association between maternal sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances during pregnancy and neonatal brain outcomes, examining sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances as a mediator of the effect of social disadvantage during pregnancy on infant structural brain outcomes. The study included 148 mother-infant dyads, recruited during early pregnancy, who had both actigraphy and neuroimaging data. Mothers' sleep was assessed throughout their pregnancy using actigraphy, and neonates underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging in the first weeks of life. Neonatal structural brain outcomes included cortical gray matter, subcortical gray matter, and white matter volumes along with a measure of the total surface area of the cortex. Neonates of mothers who experienced greater inter-daily deviations in sleep duration had smaller total cortical gray and white matter volumes and reduced cortical surface areas. Neonates of mothers who had higher levels of circadian misalignment and later sleep timing during pregnancy showed smaller subcortical gray matter volumes. Inter-daily deviations in sleep duration during pregnancy mediated the association between maternal social disadvantage and neonatal structural brain outcomes. Findings highlight the importance of regularity and rhythmicity in sleep schedules during pregnancy and bring to light the role of chronodisruption as a potential mechanism underlying the deleterious neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal adversity. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Social disadvantage was associated with sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances during pregnancy, including later sleep schedules, increased variability in sleep duration, circadian misalignment, and a higher proportion of the sleep period spent awake. Maternal sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances during pregnancy were associated with decreased brain volume and reduced cortical surface area in neonates.

Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are effective and can be delivered in primary care, but uptake has been limited in rural communities. Referral to and coordination with an external telemedicine (TM) vendor by rural primary care clinics for MOUD (TM-MOUD) may increase MOUD access for rural patients, but we know little about perspectives on this model among key stakeholders. As part of a TM-MOUD feasibility study, we explored TM-MOUD acceptability and feasibility among personnel and patients from seven rural primary care clinics and a TM-MOUD vendor. We conducted virtual interviews or focus groups with clinic administrators (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;7 interviews), clinic primary care and behavioral health providers (8 groups, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;30), other clinic staff (9 groups, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;37), patients receiving MOUD (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;16 interviews), TM-MOUD vendor staff (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;4 interviews), and vendor-affiliated behavioral health and prescribing providers (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;17 interviews). We asked about experiences with and acceptability of MOUD (primarily buprenorphine) and telemedicine (TM) and a TM-MOUD referral and coordination model. We conducted content analysis to identify themes and participants quantitatively rated acceptability of TM-MOUD elements on a 4-item scale. Perceived benefits of vendor-based TM-MOUD included reduced logistical barriers, more privacy and less stigma, and access to services not available locally (e.g., counseling, pain management). Barriers included lack of internet or poor connectivity in patients' homes, limited communication and trust between TM-MOUD and clinic providers, and questions about the value to the clinic of TM-MOUD referral to external vendor. Acceptability ratings for TM-MOUD were generally high; they were lowest among frontline staff. Rural primary care clinic personnel, TM-MOUD vendor personnel, and patients generally perceived referral from primary care to a TM-MOUD vendor to hold potential for increasing access to MOUD in rural communities. Increasing TM-MOUD uptake requires buy-in and understanding among staff of the TM-MOUD workflow, TM services offered, requirements for patients, advantages over clinic-based or TM services from clinic providers, and identification of appropriate patients. Poverty, along with patient hesitation to initiate treatment, creates substantial barriers to MOUD treatment generally; insufficient internet availability creates a substantial barrier to TM-MOUD.","D006801; D012424; D009293; D000083682; D000288; D011320","Humans; Rural Population; Opioid-Related Disorders; Opiate Overdose; Administrative Personnel; Primary Health Care",NA,"NA","Declaration of competing interest None.","Allison J Ober, Alex R Dopp, Sarah E Clingan, Megan E Curtis, Chunqing Lin, Stacy Calhoun, Sherry Larkins, Megan Black, Maria Hanano,  ..., Yih-Ing Hser","Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA."

Because of their rapid expansion in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, they have recently gained even more importance.

We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing government-funded influenza vaccination to children in China (fully-funded policy) compared with the status quo (self-paid policy). A decision tree model was developed to calculate the economic and health outcomes, from a societal perspective, using national- and provincial-level data. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) [incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained] was used to compare the fully-funded policy with the self-paid policy under the willingness-to-pay threshold equivalent to national and provincial GDP per capita. Sensitivity analyses were performed and various scenarios were explored based on real-world conditions, including incorporating indirect effect into the analysis. Compared to the self-paid policy, implementation of a fully-funded policy could prevent 1,444,768 [95% uncertainty range (UR): 1,203,446-1,719,761] symptomatic cases, 92,110 (95% UR: 66,953-122,226) influenza-related hospitalizations, and 6494 (95% UR: 4590-8962) influenza-related death per season. The fully-funded policy was cost-effective nationally (7964 USD per QALY gained) and provincially for 13 of 31 provincial-level administrative divisions (PLADs). The probability of a funded vaccination policy being cost-effective was 56.5% nationally, and the probability in 9 of 31 PLADs was above 75%. The result was most sensitive to the symptomatic influenza rate among children under 5&#xa0;years [ICER ranging from -&#xa0;25,612 (cost-saving) to 14,532 USD per QALY gained].

Evidence on ASHAs has focused on workplace challenges from a system perspective, without sufficient probing into individual-level stress. This study aims to gain perspectives into the experiences of work stress, the related health symptoms, and the responses to stress among ASHAs in India. Focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted with ASHAs in Sehore district, Madhya Pradesh, were audio-recorded and transcribed. Grounded theory was used to generate themes under the various domains of ASHAs' work and domestic life. We identified pathways between the conditions that trigger stressful events, experiences of these events, resulting perceptions, effects on health and wellbeing, and approaches used by ASHAs to respond to stress. Six FGDs with 59 ASHAs generated the following themes: (a) Facility: Workload, undue pressures, unstructured work; ASHAs' relationships with seniors (e.g., feelings of being disrespected, blamed, or targeted), and low access to physical and administrative resources; (b) Home: Feelings of guilt for putting less time for family/child care; disrespect by the elderly for a poorly incentivised job; (c) Community: Low acceptance by the villagers; caste- and gender-bias; difficult community-level relationships (emotional labour, fear/stigma towards her services); (d) Somatic and psychological symptoms: headache, exhaustion, depressive symptoms (to cite a few); and (e) Responses to stress: Motivation (support from peers, family, a sense of identity/pride, incentives), Individual strengths (e.g., social responsibility), and spiritual recourse mechanisms. This study will inform the development of a strengths-based coaching intervention to address work stress among ASHAs. The findings are relevant to building the evidence on alleviation of work stress among female frontline cadres in low-resource settings globally.","D006801; D005260; D000368; D017144; D007194; D000223; D012424; D003150","Humans; Female; Aged; Focus Groups; India; Adaptation, Psychological; Rural Population; Community Health Workers",NA,"NA","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.","Ritu Shrivastava, Lochan Sharma, Mehak Jolly, Romi Ahuja, Radhika Sharma, John A Naslund, Jyotsna Agrawal, Rahul Shidhaye, Seema Mehrotra,  ..., Ameya P Bondre","Sangath, 106, Good Shepherd Colony, Kolar Road, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, 462042, India."

In this article, the authors intend to 1) decipher the potential psychosocial basis of human suffering and poverty in patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders, and 2) discuss the apropos way-outs that would potentially mitigate suffering, and alleviate the economic burden and cognitive disabilities of families with neuropsychiatric diseases.",NA,NA,"R01 NS039422","10.31887/DCNS.2018.20.3/mhoehe; 10.1111/ane.12232; 10.1016/S1474-4422(19)30043-2; 10.1080/14737159.2017.1335598; 10.1097/WCO.0000000000000319; 10.1093/brain/awt035; 10.1016/j.gde.2020.05.032; 10.1016/j.nbd.2020.105088; 10.1007/s13311-018-00694-0; 10.1172/JCI24761; 10.1016/B978-0-12-802395-2.00021-3; 10.1007/s00439-017-1843-; 10.1038/ng.3572; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2020.01.023; 10.1111/andr.12700; 10.1007/s10567-021-00355-3; 10.1017/S0954579413000680; 10.2147/AHMT.S237807; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2013.01.026; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.106966; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2005.03.006; 10.1017/S0012162206001253; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.0154; 10.1016/j.ridd.2017.10.022; 10.1111/jar.12337; 10.1016/j.jaac.2013.07.011; 10.1017/S0033291721001951; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2014.13101306; 10.1007/s12402-014-0146-x; 10.1016/S2215-0366(16)30376-5; 10.1038/s41380-019-0350-3; 10.1186/s12913-020-05683-8; 10.1080/17482631.2020.1725362; 10.1097/ACM.0000000000000530; 10.1097/ACM.0000000000000531; 10.1017/s0317167100009082; 10.1016/j.neurol.2021.01.021; 10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102601; 10.1093/brain/awx341; 10.1371/journal.pbio.3000946; 10.3389/fpubh.2021.535737; 10.1136/jech.2007.068031; 10.3390/ijerph18042007; 10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.126; 10.1017/S1461145711001982; 10.1177/1039856212459587; 10.1038/s41380-017-0010-4; 10.1159/000505330; 10.1016/j.seizure.2021.11.021; 10.1002/mds.28575; 10.1037/per0000268; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.03.039; 10.1186/s41983-022-00538-x; 10.1080/07370016.2018.1404832; 10.1007/s10964-021-01427-x; 10.2105/AJPH.2004.055921; 10.1186/s12889-021-10176-2; 10.3390/ijerph8093528; 10.3390/ijerph19116918; 10.2196/30388; 10.1002/hbm.25562; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03544.x; 10.1037/adb0000471; 10.1037/abn0000711; 10.1007/s10339-021-01029-2; 10.1016/s0899-3289(99)00002-4; 10.1016/j.dsx.2020.06.008; 10.1016/j.cpr.2006.01.009; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2015.10.012; 10.1016/j.jad.2019.06.064; 10.29399/npa.22655; 10.1007/s10578-019-00938-w; 10.1016/j.psychres.2017.10.044; 10.1016/j.jbtep.2011.09.008; 10.18103/mra.v10i3.2707; 10.1136/jme.2003.007062; 10.1186/s12939-018-0748-6; 10.1007/s12664-020-01056-5; 10.1186/1472-6939-5-5; 10.1086/381709; 10.1016/j.actatropica.2009.08.019; 10.1111/j.1875-595X.2012.00123x; 10.1192/bjp.bp.108.050187; 10.4103/ijcm.ijcm_997_21; 10.1007/s10943-021-01466-5; 10.20529/IJME.2008.054; 10.1111/j.1525-1497.2006.00642.x; 10.1097/ACM.0000000000003765; 10.1186/s12904-018-0360-y; 10.1017/mdh.2018.23; 10.1111/medu.14074; 10.1111/j.1525-1497.2006.00646.x; 10.7748/ncyp.2022.e1416; 10.1126/science.aat7615; 10.3390/jcm10112479; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107300; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2016.04.003; 10.1016/j.healthpol.2018.05.012; 10.1177/0883073821991300; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.108260; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107638; 10.2147/AHMT.S175765; 10.1007/s00787-016-0873-y; 10.1007/s10519-020-10006-y; 10.1186/s40359-021-00633-3; 10.1097/YCO.0000000000000701; 10.1155/2021/6667006; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2011.07.031; 10.1146/annurev-neuro-071714-034136; 10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.02.006; 10.1016/j.prdoa.2020.100038; 10.1038/s41398-018-0204-9; 10.3389/fneur.2018.00491; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.0350; 10.1001/jama.291.3.358; 10.1007/s00127-015-1072-8; 10.1002/da.23277; 10.1186/s13229-018-0193-9; 10.1136/bmjgh-2019-002026; 10.1080/23288604.2020.1833639; 10.1007/s001150050653; 10.3233/JHD-190382; 10.1007/s11920-019-1017-0; 10.1377/hlthaff.2016.0605; 10.1111/bioe.12357; 10.1186/s40659-016-0070-y; 10.1016/j.tics.2016.10.008; 10.5114/ninp.2013.39069; 10.1016/j.rcp.2017.05.001; 10.1055/s-0042-1745741; 10.1097/ACM.0000000000001003; 10.1007/s40596-014-0112-0; 10.1007/s40596-014-0045-7; 10.1007/s40596-014-0049-3; 10.1176/appi.focus.20180033; 10.4103/0973-1229.109282; 10.1176/jnp.1.2.173; 10.1080/17470919.2016.1245214; 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.17100200; 10.31887/DCNS.2018.20.2/gfricchione; 10.1353/pbm.2010.0012; 10.1159/000447359; 10.30773/pi.2021.0258; 10.1176/appi.ajp.159.5.695; 10.1007/s00406-007-0783-6; 10.1016/j.mehy.2005.05.007; 10.1016/j.psychres.2016.04.042; 10.1017/S2045796016000949; 10.1177/070674371205700804; 10.1016/j.cpr.2011.05.003","We wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication, and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome.","Souvik Dubey, Ritwik Ghosh, Mahua Jana Dubey, Shambaditya Das, Arka Prava Chakraborty, Arindam Santra, Ajitava Dutta, Dipayan Roy, Alak Pandit,  ..., Juli&#xe1;n Benito-Le&#xf3;n","Department of Neurology, University Hospital ""12 de Octubre"", Madrid, Spain."

Forty percent of the NTD-affected people live in Africa with the poorest, most vulnerable, and hard to reach geographical areas. The NTDs cause significant social and economic burden and deepen marginalization and stigmatization. The World Health Organization's current roadmap for NTD aims to prevent, control, eliminate, or eradicate 20 tropical diseases. Ethiopia experiences a high burden of these diseases, but current access to diagnostics, medicine, and/or care has been little explored to inform the country's NTD strategic plan. The overall purpose of the scoping review was to map and characterize the burden of NTDs and challenges in access to diagnostics, medicine, and/or care in Ethiopia. A systematic search of evidence was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from January 2000 until May 2022, without restrictions of language or study design. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Review was followed for screening of studies. Key findings were extracted and narrated qualitatively. The search resulted in 4532 articles, of which 105 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the scoping review under three themes: burden of NTDs, access to diagnostics, medicine and/or care, and key barriers. Although gains have been made in the prevention and control of NTDs in Ethiopia, the burden remains high, and progress in access to diagnostics, medicine/drugs, and/or care is very slow. Poverty, poor quality of life, and underfunding of NTD programs decelerate the process of NTD elimination program in the country. The scoping review identified a considerable number of studies on the burden of NTDs in Ethiopia and strategies for diagnosis, treatment, and/or care; however, there is a paucity of evidence on the suitability and potential benefits of novel diagnostic technologies and medicines in the country. A regular review and analysis of such country-level evidence is important to inform the country NTDs roadmap and local implementation strategies.","D006801; D005002; D011788; D014330; D014943; D058069; D006297","Humans; Ethiopia; Quality of Life; Tropical Medicine; Global Health; Neglected Diseases; Health Services Accessibility","221576/Z/20/Z","10.1007/s40121-020-00361-y; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008319; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0009379; 10.1186/s13071-021-04600-0; 10.1016/j.parepi.2021.e00210; 10.1016/j.fawpar.2020.e00089; 10.1186/s13071-020-04317-6; 10.1371/journal.pone.0243863; 10.1186/s13104-019-4317-x; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008120; 10.1016/j.inhe.2011.03.004; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008882; 10.1371/journal.pone.0235281; 10.1002/central/CN-02201675/full","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Agumasie Semahegn, Tsegahun Manyazewal, Eyerusalem Getachew, Bethelhem Fekadu, Esubalew Assefa, Munir Kassa, Gail Davey, Michael Hopkins, Mesele Araya,  ..., Abebaw Fekadu","Centre for Innovative Drug Development and Therapeutic Trials for Africa (CDT-Africa), College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia."

Contingency management (CM) is a treatment for substance use disorders that has shown to be effective in eliciting behaviour change. The efficacy of CM interventions in low and middle income countries (LMICs) has been under explored. The aim of this systematic review of randomized controlled trials was to assess measures of CM efficacy in addressing substance use disorders, while also considering contextual moderators of CM in LMICs. A search of PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane library databases yielded 18 studies for inclusion, from which relevant data were extracted using modified versions of the Cochrane Characteristics of Studies tool. Two studies were located in a low-income country, two in lower-middle income countries, and fourteen in upper middle-income countries. Overall, estimated efficacy estimates were similar to those from higher income countries. However, context-specific challenges that warrant further investigation included limited access to trained staff and structural and financial constraints. While CM in LMICs is in its early stages of development, efficacy estimates were not substantially different compared to high income countries.

A growing knowledge of the biology of development and neuroscience has highlighted the importance of adverse environmental exposures, collectively termed adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on health outcomes. ACEs are associated with short-term, medium-term and long-term negative consequences for health and development and their effects may be multiplicative, especially during critical periods of sensitivity and developmental plasticity. Some of these effects are compounded by emerging global threats such as climate change, conflict and population displacement. In this Review, we discuss the key mechanisms linking ACEs to health outcomes and consider promising strategies to prevent and mitigate their effects, highlighting evidence from programs in low-income and middle-income countries. Finally, we emphasize the need for early recognition of ACEs and delivery of packages of interventions spanning key sectors such as health, education, women's empowerment and social protection.","D002648; D006801; D005260; D000076783; D011203; D011640","Child; Humans; Female; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Poverty; Public Policy",NA,"10.1016/j.pcl.2019.12.001; 10.1038/s41390-020-01264-x; 10.1038/s41390-022-01933-z; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.03.008; 10.3390/ijms22073344; 10.1002/jnr.23802; 10.1126/sciadv.abn4316; 10.3945/an.115.010348; 10.1038/s41366-018-0206-y; 10.1111/acer.14945; 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2007.01809.x; 10.1017/S2040174409990171; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2023.105033; 10.3390/jcm12041263; 10.1016/S2214-109X(18)30351-6; 10.3390/toxics9020023; 10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040119-094230; 10.1177/0886260518792963; 10.1016/S2352-4642(17)30024-X; 10.1007/s11682-018-9980-3; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60072-5; 10.1177/0141076818764995; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2019.05.012; 10.1111/jcpp.12784; 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.748372; 10.1016/j.bbi.2019.04.028; 10.1159/000490302; 10.1016/j.bbr.2021.113474; 10.1080/1744666X.2022.2052045; 10.1037/bul0000270; 10.1038/mp.2017.26; 10.3389/fpubh.2021.649825; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2019.03.022; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.10.015; 10.1176/appi.ajp.21090961; 10.1136/bmj.m3048; 10.1136/bmjgh-2022-010713; 10.1371/journal.pgph.0001567; 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31389-7; 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103538; 10.1073/pnas.1307893110; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00852.x; 10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003508; 10.1093/ajcn/66.2.247; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.3530; 10.1136/bmj.b974; 10.1186/s13063-017-1790-1; 10.1126/science.1251178; 10.1111/jcpp.13213; 10.1016/S0749-3797(98)00017-8; 10.1097/DBP.0b013e31828a7dfc; 10.1016/j.amepre.2010.02.017; 10.1016/j.cpr.2017.11.009; 10.1007/s10826-018-1034-3; 10.1186/s12889-020-08789-0; 10.1016/S2215-0366(19)30403-1; 10.1111/jcpp.12642; 10.1017/S0954579410000611; 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02725-2; 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02533-2; 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02716-1; 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02532-0; 10.1111/jcpp.13129; 10.1136/bmjgh-2017-000539; 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059914; 10.1136/bmj-2022-072046; 10.1542/peds.2023-060221L; 10.1186/1741-7015-12-56; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1004046; 10.1016/j.jaac.2014.09.011; 10.1017/gmh.2018.7",NA,"Zulfiqar A Bhutta, Supriya Bhavnani, Theresa S Betancourt, Mark Tomlinson, Vikram Patel","Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA."

It is often implied but not tested that choice patterns among low-income individuals may be a factor impeding behavioral interventions aimed at improving upward economic mobility. To test this, we assessed rates of ten cognitive biases across nearly 5000 participants from 27 countries. Our analyses were primarily focused on 1458 individuals that were either low-income adults or individuals who grew up in disadvantaged households but had above-average financial well-being as adults, known as positive deviants. Using discrete and complex models, we find evidence of no differences within or between groups or countries. We therefore conclude that choices impeded by cognitive biases alone cannot explain why some individuals do not experience upward economic mobility.

Evidence from population-based reports, cognitive neuroscience, and clinical studies suggests that these values depend on social cognition processes, such as empathy, deontological moral cognition, moral emotions, and social cooperation. Additionally, indirect evidence suggests that various forms of prosocial behaviors are associated with positive health outcomes at the behavioral, cardiovascular, immune, stress-related, and inflammatory pathways. However, it is unclear whether prosociality can positively influence brain health outcomes. In this perspective, we propose that prosocial values are not only influenced by brain conditions but could also potentially play a role in protecting brain health. We review studies from various fields that support this claim, including recent reports of prosociality-based interventions impacting brain health. We then explore potential multilevel mechanisms, based on the reduction of allostatic overload at behavioral, cardiovascular, immune, stress-related, and inflammatory levels. Finally, we propose potential prosociality-based interventions for improving brain health in at-risk populations, such as psychiatric and neurological patients, and individuals exposed to poverty or violence.

Chronic homelessness was associated with elevated odds of mental health and medical diagnoses, traumatic experiences, incarceration, and suicidal thoughts. Veterans with versus without chronic homelessness more frequently reported needing substance use, medical and psychiatric treatments but expressed low interest in participation in psychiatric treatment. Veterans with GD and chronic homelessness have more clinical and behavioral concerns and needs for treatment, but participate in treatment at lower rates.

Based on 68 scientific communications between 1941 and 1962 by qualified medical professionals, the disease emerged in different geographical locations involving selective populations: (1) farmers from extensive areas of central Spain, traditionally producers and consumers of grasspea; (2) immigrants in the industrial belt of Catalonia and in the Basque Country, areas with little or no production of grasspea, which was imported from producing areas; (3) workers in Galicia, an area where the legume is neither produced nor consumed, who were seasonally displaced to high-production areas of grasspea in Castille; and (4) inmates of overcrowded postwar Spanish prisons. Original reports included failed attempts by Carlos Jim&#xe9;nez D&#xed;az (1898-1967) to induce experimental lathyrism, the neuropathology of lathyrism in early stages of the disease in two patients, as reported by Carlos Oliveras de la Riva (1914-2007), and the special susceptibility of children to develop a severe form of lathyrism after relatively brief periods of consumption of the neurotoxic seed of <i>L. sativus</i>. In the Spanish Basque Country, <i>L. cicera</i> L. (<i>aizkol</i>) was cultivated exclusively as animal fodder. Patients who were forced to feed on this plant developed unusual manifestations of lathyrism, such as axial myoclonus and severe neuropsychiatric disorders, unknown in other regions of the country and previously unreported. The postwar epidemic of lathyrism in Spain represents the most extensively studied outbreak of this self-limiting but crippling upper motor neuron disease.","D002648; D000818; D006801; D007842; D013030; D027807; D009422; D000069338","Child; Animals; Humans; Lathyrism; Spain; Lathyrus; Nervous System Diseases; Neuropathology",NA,"NA",NA,"Santiago Gim&#xe9;nez-Rold&#xe1;n, Valerie S Palmer, Peter S Spencer","Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, Oregon Health &amp; Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA."

In humans, myriad forms of ELS-including childhood abuse, bullying, poverty, and trauma-are increasingly prevalent. Understanding the signs of ELS, including those associated with psychiatric illness, will enable improved treatment and prevention. Here, we developed a novel procedure to model human ELS in mice and identify translationally-relevant biomarkers of mood and anxiety disorders. We exposed male mice (C57BL/6&#x2009;J) to an early-life (juvenile) chronic social defeat stress (jCSDS) and examined social interaction and responsivity to reward during adulthood. As expected, jCSDS-exposed mice showed a socially avoidant phenotype in open-field social interaction tests. However, sucrose preference tests failed to demonstrate ELS-induced reductions in choice for the sweetened solution, suggesting no effect on reward function. To explore whether other tasks might be more sensitive to changes in motivation, we tested the mice in the Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT), a procedure often used in humans to study reward learning deficits associated with depressive illness. In a touchscreen PRT variant that was reverse-translated to maximize alignment with the version used in human subjects, mice exposed to jCSDS displayed significant reductions in the tendency to develop response biases for the more richly-rewarded stimulus, a hallmark sign of anhedonia when observed in humans. Our findings suggest that translationally-relevant procedures that utilize the same endpoints across species may enable the development of improved model systems that more accurately predict outcomes in humans.","D006801; D051379; D008297; D002648; D000818; D000328; D000076783; D013315; D008810; D001921; D012201","Humans; Mice; Male; Child; Animals; Adult; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Stress, Psychological; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Brain; Reward","F32 MH125634; P50 MH115874; R01 MH063266; T32 MH125786","10.1503/jpn.180053; 10.1037/bul0000270; 10.1146/annurev-devpsych-121318-084950; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.10.012; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.20081192; 10.3389/fnsys.2022.860847; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.06.021; 10.3389/fnbeh.2019.00167; 10.3389/fnbeh.2022.882464; 10.1093/ijnp/pyy038; 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.01.016; 10.3389/fnbeh.2011.00072; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2020.12.030; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0885-17.2017; 10.1097/FBP.0000000000000155; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.12.014; 10.1038/nprot.2007.441; 10.1016/j.cell.2007.09.018; 10.1038/nprot.2011.361; 10.1901/jeab.2008.90-103; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.09091379; 10.1016/0091-3057(91)90284-9; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2004.11.026; 10.1007/s40614-021-00288-w; 10.1038/s41398-020-00969-1; 10.1007/s40473-015-0044-3; 10.1038/s41386-021-01250-9; 10.1038/npp.2016.215; 10.1097/HRP.0000000000000230; 10.1038/s41398-022-02159-7; 10.1038/s41380-019-0628-5; 10.1038/nature11713; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.12.009; 10.1038/nn.3591; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1731-10.2010; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1787-13.2014","WAC and KJR are members of the NPP editorial board.

The aim of this study was to explore the association between sociodemographic background factors and the use of personal assistance and home help services (home help) among persons with MS in Sweden. The study was based on cross-sectional survey data merged with register data and included 3,863 persons with MS aged 20-51. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with the use of personal assistance and home help. The central finding of this study was that grade of impairment, as determined by the Expanded Disability Status Scale for Multiple Sclerosis (EDSS), was the most important variable associated with the use of both personal assistance (p &lt; 0.001, OR 18.83) and home help (p &lt; 0.001, OR 6.83). Living alone and receiving sickness benefit were also both associated with the use of personal assistance (p &lt; 0.001, OR 3.32; p 0.001, OR 3.32) and home help (p 0.004, OR 2.56; p 0.011, OR 2.56). Stating a visible symptom of MS as being the most limiting factor of the disease (p 0.001, OR 2.73) and having a disposable income below the limit for poverty risk (p 0.02, OR 2.16) was associated with the use of personal assistance. Receiving informal, meaning unpaid, help (p 0.049, OR 1.89) was associated with the use of home help. Several background factors were controlled for but were not related to differences in the usage of formal help. The results indicated no significant differences in demographic characteristics that could be linked to unequal distribution. However, differences were found between those using personal assistance and home help. The latter were mainly affected by invisible symptoms, suggesting a plausible influencing factor in the chances of obtaining more comprehensive help in the form of personal assistance. Users of home help were also more likely to receive informal help than users of personal assistance, which may suggest that home help is not sufficient.","D006801; D000203; D009103; D013548; D003430; D007182; D006233","Humans; Activities of Daily Living; Multiple Sclerosis; Sweden; Cross-Sectional Studies; Income; Disabled Persons",NA,"10.1177/1352458511403794; 10.1038/s41572-018-0041-4; 10.1186/s12883-021-02344-z; 10.16993/SJDR.610; 10.1080/13691457.2019.1639627; 10.1080/09638288.2021.1897691; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.07.023; 10.1371/journal.pone.0235774; 10.1186/s12913-015-1010-1; 10.7224/1537-2073-14.1.2; 10.1177/1352458508089688; 10.1080/09638280400007802; 10.1080/09638280802532779; 10.1136/jnnp.69.6.728; 10.2165/00019053-200826100-00005; 10.1371/journal.pone.0109679; 10.1016/j.msard.2018.12.043; 10.1186/1471-2377-8-36; 10.1191/1352458503ms955oa; 10.1177/1352458508095730; 10.1111/ane.12425; 10.1007/s10654-019-00511-8; 10.1212/wnl.33.11.1444; 10.1080/09687599.2017.1375900; 10.1080/13557858.2014.979768; 10.1093/aje/kwx246","Friberg is partly funded by an unrestricted research grant from Biogen and has received unrestricted research grants from Celgene/Bristol-Myers Squibb.

Although none of these theories are fully consistent with observed SES-related differences in brain development, existing evidence suggests that low SES is associated with brain structure trajectories more consistent with a delayed or simply different developmental pattern than an acceleration in neurodevelopment.","D002648; D000293; D006801; D012923; D001921","Child; Adolescent; Humans; Social Class; Brain","R01 MH106482; R37 MH119194","10.1177/0963721412453588; 10.1177/0963721419837670; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.20081192; 10.1176/APPI.AJP.2021.20081192; 10.1037/met0000407; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2023.119885; 10.1007/978-l-4615-4831-7_25; 10.1016/J.DCN.2022.101164; 10.1017/S0033291721003135; 10.1016/J.BPSC.2022.01.006; 10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031912-114413; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.0426; 10.1542/PEDS.2020-049702","Declaration of interests No interests are declared.","Divyangana Rakesh, Sarah Whittle, Margaret A Sheridan, Katie A McLaughlin","Department of Psychology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA."

However, their impact on health in populations with physical disabilities in low-resource countries is still lacking. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate associations of individual SES with health and the moderating effect of gender on this association in a Moroccan population with a physical disability, namely spinal cord injury. Cross-sectional survey data from 385 participants with spinal cord injury living in Morocco were analyzed. SES was operationalized by education level, household income, financial hardship, and subjective social status. Health indicators included secondary conditions, pain, vitality, quality of life, and general health. Associations between SES and health indicators were investigated using linear and logistic regressions. To test the potential moderation of gender, interaction terms between SES and gender were introduced in regression models. Financial hardship and lower subjective social status were associated with poorer health outcomes in four out of five indicators in the total sample. In contrast, education and income were inconsistently associated with health. Overall, gender did not moderate the association between SES and health, except that educational inequalities in general health were more pronounced in women, and the observation of a trend for a stronger negative effect of subjective social status on men's than woman's health (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). This study revealed that subjective indicators of SES negatively impact on health, whereas evidence for the moderating role of gender in this association was weak.

The overall model significantly predicted PTSD symptoms, with a main effect of racial discrimination (<i>B</i> = 1.87, <i>p</i> = .009) and neighborhood poverty rate (<i>B</i> = 0.29, <i>p</i> = .008), independent of prior trauma exposure and percentage of Black residents in the zip code. More frequent experiences of racial discrimination and higher rates of neighborhood poverty both predicted higher PTSD symptoms. There was also a trending interaction of racial discrimination and neighborhood poverty (<i>B</i> = -0.05, <i>p</i> = .054), where the effect of neighborhood poverty on PTSD symptoms was only present for those who reported fewer experiences of racial discrimination. Our results suggest that people who have experienced more instances of racial discrimination show high levels of PTSD symptoms regardless of neighborhood poverty rates and highlight the importance of considering multiple levels of oppression that Black individuals face while diagnosing and treating stress-related psychopathology.

Biology.","Social determinants of health (SDoHs) are nonmedical factors that significantly impact health and longevity. We found no published reviews on the biology of SDoHs in schizophrenia-spectrum psychotic disorders (SSPD). We present an overview of pathophysiological mechanisms and neurobiological processes plausibly involved in the effects of major SDoHs on clinical outcomes in SSPD. This review of the biology of SDoHs focuses on early-life adversities, poverty, social disconnection, discrimination including racism, migration, disadvantaged neighborhoods, and food insecurity. These factors interact with psychological and biological factors to increase the risk and worsen the course and prognosis of schizophrenia. Published studies on the topic are limited by cross-sectional design, variable clinical and biomarker assessments, heterogeneous methods, and a lack of control for confounding variables. Drawing on preclinical and clinical studies, we propose a biological framework to consider the likely pathogenesis. Putative systemic pathophysiological processes include epigenetics, allostatic load, accelerated aging with inflammation (inflammaging), and the microbiome. These processes affect neural structures, brain function, neurochemistry, and neuroplasticity, impacting the development of psychosis, quality of life, cognitive impairment, physical comorbidities, and premature mortality. Our model provides a framework for research that could lead to developing specific strategies for prevention and treatment of the risk factors and biological processes, thereby improving the quality of life and increasing the longevity of people with SSPD. Biology of SDoHs in SSPD is an exciting area of research that points to innovative multidisciplinary team science for improving the course and prognosis of these serious psychiatric disorders.","D006801; D012559; D011788; D003430; D064890; D011618; D001695","Humans; Schizophrenia; Quality of Life; Cross-Sectional Studies; Social Determinants of Health; Psychotic Disorders; Biology","K23 MH121792; R01 MH094151; P50 MH100023; MH110418; U01 DA041120; 2R01MH094151-08; R01 MH066031; P51 OD011132; R01 MH104964; R01 MH113883","NA",NA,"Dilip V Jeste, Dolores Malaspina, Kara Bagot, Deanna M Barch, Steve Cole, Faith Dickerson, Amanda Dilmore, Charles L Ford, Nicole R Karcher,  ..., Larry J Young","Center for Translational Social Neuroscience, Department of Psychiatry, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA."

This was a retrospective, population-based study that utilized the GCNKSS (Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Study) data. Patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack were identified in the years 2005, 2010, and 2015 in a metropolitan population of 1.3 million. The proportion of imaging use within 2 days of stroke/transient ischemic attack onset or hospital admission date was computed. SES determined by the percentage below the poverty level within a given respondent's US census tract of residence was dichotomized. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the odds of advanced neuroimaging use (computed tomography angiogram/magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiogram) for age, race, gender, and SES. There was a total of 10&#x2009;526 stroke/transient ischemic attack events in the combined study year periods of 2005, 2010, and 2015.

Epigenetics, including DNA methylation, have been implicated as a potential mechanism for these effects. Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) is a neurotransmitter involved in learning and memory, and altered <i>BDNF</i> promoter methylation measured in peripheral tissue has been found with early-life stress. However, whether such methylation differences remain stable into later life, is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the association between childhood adversity and <i>BDNF</i> promoter methylation in adults aged 65 years and over. Data came from a large study of older community-dwelling individuals in France (ESPRIT). Information on three major childhood adverse events, namely abuse/maltreatment, war/natural disaster, and financial difficulties/poverty, was obtained by retrospective reporting from participants of ESPRIT study. <i>BDNF</i> promoter I and IV methylation was assessed in blood and buccal tissue. Linear regression analysis was performed, adjusting for age, sex, education, depression, and morbidity. Among 927 participants, there was no strong evidence that childhood abuse/maltreatment or financial difficulties/poverty were associated with <i>BDNF</i> methylation in older individuals.

Increasing work participation for people with persistent pain improves their health, quality of life, and well-being and reduces poverty; however, it is not clear how to best help unemployed people who have persistent pain to return to work. The aim of this study is to examine if a matched work placement intervention featuring case manager support and work-focused healthcare improves return to work rates and quality of life for unemployed people in Norway with persistent pain who want to work. We will use a cohort randomised controlled approach to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a matched work placement intervention featuring case manager support and work-focused healthcare compared to those receiving usual care in the cohort alone. We will recruit people aged 18-64, who have been out of work for at least 1&#xa0;month, had pain for more than 3&#xa0;months, and want to work. Initially, all (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;228) will be recruited to an observational cohort study on the impact of being unemployed with persistent pain. We will then randomly select one in three to be offered the intervention. The primary outcome of sustained return to work will be measured using registry and self-reported data, while secondary outcomes include self-reported levels of health-related quality of life and physical and mental health. Outcomes will be measured at baseline and 3, 6, and 12&#xa0;months post-randomisation. We will run a process evaluation parallel to the intervention exploring implementation, continuity of the intervention, reasons for participating, declining participation, and mechanisms behind cases of sustained return to work. An economic evaluation of the trial process will also be conducted. The ReISE intervention is designed to increase work participation for people with persistent pain. The intervention has the potential to improve work ability by collaboratively navigating obstacles to working. If successful, the intervention may be a viable option for helping people in this population.

Twelve systematic reviews examining mental health difficulties in one or several marginalised groups during the COVID-19 pandemic and five systematic reviews on interventions that can mitigate the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were retained in our literature review. The mental health of marginalised groups was severely affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most frequently reported mental health difficulties included symptoms of anxiety and depression.

Poor children are alleged to give up more often than their more privileged peers when facing challenges. Yet little research has examined the role of task persistence in poverty and mental health. We test whether poverty-related deficits in persistence contribute to the well-documented link between childhood disadvantage and mental health. We used growth curve modeling to analyze three waves (age 9, 13, and 17) of data assessing the trajectories of persistence on challenging tasks and mental health. Childhood poverty is the proportion of time participants lived in poverty from birth to age 9. We found that individuals experiencing more poverty in early childhood demonstrate less persistence and deteriorated mental health from ages 9 to 17. As expected, task persistence accounts for a portion of the robust childhood poverty - worsening mental health association.

The little routinely collected population-level data from Indigenous communities in the region available shows stark inequities in health and well-being. There are 305 Indigenous ethnic groups, speaking 274 languages, spread across the remote national territory, who have endured long-lasting inequities related to poverty, poor health, and limited access to health care. Malnutrition and mental health are key concerns for young people. Building on our Indigenous communities-academic partnerships over the last two decades, we collaborated with young people from the Terena Indigenous ethnic group, village leaders, teachers, parents, and local health practitioners from the Polo Base (community health centres) to obtain their perspectives on important and feasible actions for a youth health promotion programme. The report was conducted in the Terer&#xe9; Village in Mato Grosso do Sul. Concept mapping, a participatory mixed method approach, was conducted in 7 workshops, 15 adults and 40 youths aged 9-17 years. Art-based concept mapping was used with 9 to 11 years old children (N = 20). Concept systems software was used to create concept maps, which were finalised during the workshops. Focused prompts related to factors that may influence the health and happiness of youths. The participatory method gave Terena youths a significant voice in shaping an agenda that can improve their health. Terena youths identified priority actions that clustered under 'Family', 'School', 'Education', 'Socio-economic circumstances', 'Respect' and 'Sport' in response to protecting happiness; and 'Nutrition pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Local environment', and 'Well-being' in response to having a healthy body. Through the participatory lens of concept mapping, youths articulated the interconnectedness of priority actions across these clusters such that behaviours (e.g. Nutrition pattern, drinking water, physical activity) and aspirations (being able to read, to have a good job) were recognised to be dependent on a wider ecology of factors (e.g. loss of eco-systems, parent-child relationships, student- teacher relationships, parental unemployment). In response to developing youth health, Terena adults suggested priority actions that clustered under 'Relationships', 'Health issues', 'Prevention at Polo Base', 'Access to health care', 'Communication with young people', 'Community life', 'Raising awareness' and 'School support'. Their priorities reflected the need for structural transformative actions (e.g. Polo Base and school staff working together) and for embedding actions to protect Indigenous culture (e.g. integrating their cultural knowledge into training programmes). Concept maps of Indigenous youths emphasised the need for a health promotion programme that engages with the structural and social determinants of health to protect their happiness and health, whilst those of adults emphasised the need to address specific health issues through preventative care via a school-Polo Base collaboration. Investment in a co-developed school-Polo-Base health promotion programme, with intersectoral engagement, has potential for making Indigenous health systems responsive to the inequalities of youth health, to yield dividends for healthy ageing trajectories as well as for the health of the next generation.","D000328; D006801; D000293; D002648; D001938; D006293; D003695; D005006; D013334","Adult; Humans; Adolescent; Child; Brazil; Health Promotion; Delivery of Health Care; Ethnicity; Students","MR/R022739/1","10.1590/1806-9282.66.7.861; 10.1186/1471-2458-13-52; 10.1177/1049732305278876; 10.1155/2015/412804; 10.1186/1748-5908-6-104; 10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2007.05.007; 10.1093/jpepsy/jst079; 10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2016.10.006","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Paulo T C Jardim, Josiliane M Dias, Antonio J Grande, Andr&#xe9; B Veras, &#xc9;rika K Ferri, Fatima A A Quadros, Clayton Peixoto, Francielle C S Botelho, Maria I M G Oliveira,  ..., Seeromanie Harding","Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, United Kingdom."

This has been attributed to the acute side effects experienced by patients on typical antipsychotics that lead to nonadherence. However, the treatment cost with typical antipsychotics is cheaper (preferred in low-income settings), and there is no difference in the effectiveness, efficacy, discontinuation rate, or side effect symptom burden with atypical antipsychotics. This study is aimed at determining the prevalence of nonadherence and the associated factors to typical antipsychotics among patients with schizophrenia attending a psychiatric outpatient clinic at a rural tertiary facility in Uganda. A cross-sectional study among 135 patients with schizophrenia for at least six months on typical antipsychotics (mean age of 39.7 (&#xb1;11.9) and 55.6% were female) from a rural tertiary facility in Uganda. Data were collected regarding sociodemographics, adherence, insight for psychosis, attitude towards typical antipsychotics, side effects, satisfaction with medications, and explanations from health workers about medications and side effects. Logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with nonadherence. The prevalence of nonadherence was 16.3%, and the likelihood of being nonadherent was more among the poor (monthly earning below the poverty line). However, having reduced energy was associated with reducing the likelihood of having nonadherence. The prevalence of nonadherence was lower than many previously obtained prevalence and was comparable to nonadherence for atypical antipsychotics. However, to reduce nonadherence, we need all stakeholders (such as the government, insurance companies, and caregivers) to assist patients living in poverty with access to medication.",NA,NA,NA,"10.2174/1568026621666210701103147; 10.1177/20451253211012250; 10.3390/brainsci11020275; 10.2147/PROM.S42735; 10.4088/JCP.v67n1008; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60239-6; 10.1176/appi.ajp.160.8.1396; 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2017.07.001; 10.1177/2054270418758570; 10.1192/bjp.bp.109.066217; 10.1038/mp.2011.143; 10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31135-3; 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01997-8; 10.31887/DCNS.2010.12.3/jkane; 10.1371/journal.pone.0120560; 10.21767/1791-809X.1000520; 10.1097/JCP.0b013e318268ddc0; 10.3109/00048674.2010.493503; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2015.09.006; 10.4102/sajpsychiatry.v24i0.1124; 10.1176/appi.ps.201500056; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2013.03.002; 10.2147/PPA.S41609; 10.1017/S2045796013000097; 10.4088/JCP.v67n0317; 10.1177/2045125312474019; 10.1016/j.psychres.2009.05.004; 10.5897/JNBH2015.0128; 10.12816/0000100; 10.1007/s10597-014-9697-8; 10.1016/j.psychres.2007.07.027; 10.1007/s12571-017-0730-y; 10.1007/s44192-022-00018-x; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1994.tb01487.x; 10.1016/j.psychres.2014.01.043; 10.1017/S0033291700050182; 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2012.02.008; 10.1016/S0920-9964(99)00130-9; 10.1590/2237-6089-2017-0077; 10.2165/00115677-200311110-00002; 10.1017/S1092852900022045; 10.2174/1874941001104010058; 10.1001/jama.2013.281053; 10.1037/1082-989X.1.1.16; 10.1192/bjp.183.3.197; 10.1001/journalofethics.2015.17.11.stas1-1511; 10.4103/0022-3859.166514; 10.4103/0253-7176.135383; 10.1111/j.1440-1819.2007.01722.x; 10.4088/JCP.14m09669; 10.3310/hta20700; 10.1016/j.cegh.2013.11.001; 10.2174/1574886314666190301152734","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Moses Kule, Mark Mohan Kaggwa","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, Canada."

However, whether these risks are modified by a neighbourhood's socioeconomic profile is unclear. The aim of our study was to compare risks among disadvantaged young people residing in deprived areas versus risks among similarly disadvantaged individuals residing in affluent areas. We did a national cohort study, using Danish interlinked national registers, from which we delineated a longitudinal cohort of people born in Denmark between Jan 1, 1981, and Dec 31, 2001, with two Danish-born parents, who were alive and residing in the country when they were aged 15 years, who were followed up for a hospital-treated self-harm episode or violent crime conviction. A neighbourhood affluence indicator was derived based on nationwide income quartiles, with parental income and educational attainment indicating the socioeconomic position of each cohort member's family. Bayesian multilevel survival analyses were done to examine the moderating influences of neighbourhood affluence on associations between family socioeconomic position and sex-specific risks for the two adverse outcomes. 1&#x2008;084&#x2008;047 cohort members were followed up for 12&#xb7;8 million person-years in aggregate. Individuals of a low socioeconomic position residing in deprived neighbourhoods had a higher incidence of both self-harm and violent criminality compared with equivalently disadvantaged peers residing in affluent areas. Women from a low-income background residing in affluent areas had, on average, 95 (highest density interval 76-118) fewer self-harm episodes and 25 (15-41) fewer violent crime convictions per 10&#x2008;000 person-years compared with women of an equally low income residing in deprived areas, whereas men of a low income residing in affluent areas had 61 (39-81) fewer self-harm episodes and 88 (56-191) fewer violent crime convictions per 10&#x2008;000 person-years than men of a low income residing in deprived areas. Even in a high-income European country with comprehensive social welfare and low levels of poverty and inequality, individuals residing in affluent neighbourhoods have lower risks of self-harm and violent criminality compared with individuals residing in deprived neighbourhoods. More research is needed to explore the potential of neighbourhood policies and interventions to reduce the harmful effects of growing up in socioeconomically deprived circumstances on later risk of self-harm and violent crime convictions.

This study investigated the burden of disease attributable to amphetamine use disorder, cannabis use disorder (CAD), cocaine use disorder, and opioid use disorder (OUD) in South America from 1990 to 2019, on the basis of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019. GBD 2019 estimated the incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLL), years of life lived with disability (YLD), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to substance use disorders in each of the 12 South American countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela). Data were modelled using standardised tools (ie, the Cause of Death Ensemble model, spatio-temporal Gaussian process regression, and disease modelling meta-regression) to generate estimates of each quantity of interest by sex, location, and year. The analysis included comparisons by sex and country, and against regional and global estimates. In 2019, the highest amphetamine use disorder burden per 100&#x2008;000 population in South America was in Peru (66 DALYs). CAD DALY rates per 100&#x2008;000 in South America were stable between 1990 and 2019, except in Chile and Colombia, which had the highest rates in 2019 (19 DALYs for Chile and 18 DALYs for Colombia). OUD DALYs per 100&#x2008;000 increased during the period in Brazil and Peru, which in 2019 had the highest rates in South America (82 DALYs for Brazil and 70 DALYs for Peru). In 2019, Brazil had the highest cocaine use disorder DALYs per 100&#x2008;000 (45 DALYs), nearly double its rate in 1990. DALY rates were higher in males than females for each substance use disorder, except in Paraguay. The overall burden of substance use disorders was higher in males than in females, mainly because of cocaine use disorder and CAD, whereas for amphetamine use disorder, the difference between sexes was minimal, and for OUD there was no difference. For males and females, the highest rate of substance use disorders DALYs per 100&#x2008;000 was for OUD except in Argentina (in males, 58 DALYs for cocaine use disorder vs 52 DALYs for OUD) and in Paraguay (in females, 77 for amphetamine use disorder vs 50 for OUD). CAD DALY rates were generally the lowest among the substance use disorders for males and females. Amphetamine use disorder YLD rates were reasonably stable throughout the period and were highest in Peru, Paraguay, and Uruguay (&gt;40 YLD per 100&#x2008;000). For CAD, YLD rates were stable in all countries except Chile and Colombia. Cocaine use disorder YLD rates per 100&#x2008;000 for the top four countries (Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, and Brazil) increased from 1990 to 2010 (eg, from 19 to 33 in Brazil), but decreased between 2010 and 2019 (eg, from 36 to 31 in Chile). For OUD, YLD rates showed a slight increase in most countries apart from Brazil, which increased from 52 in 1990 to 80 in 2019 and was top among the countries. Amphetamine use disorder YLL rates per 100&#x2008;000 were highest in Suriname and Peru during the period, although in Suriname it increased from 2&#xb7;7 in 2010 to 3&#xb7;2 in 2019, whereas in Peru it decreased from 2&#xb7;1 to 1&#xb7;7. The highest YLL rate for cocaine use disorder was in Brazil, which increased from 3&#xb7;7 in 1990 to 18&#xb7;1 in 2019. Between 2000 and 2019, Chile and Uruguay showed the highest OUD YLL rates (11&#xb7;6 for Chile and 10&#xb7;9 for Uruguay). A high incidence of CAD was found in Chile, Colombia, Guyana, and Suriname. There were high incidences of amphetamine use disorder in Paraguay, cocaine use disorder in Argentina, and OUD in Ecuador. A decrease in annual prevalence for substance use disorders during the period was observed in Venezuela (amphetamine use disorder, CAD, and OUD), Brazil (CAD and amphetamine use disorder), Colombia (amphetamine use disorder and cocaine use disorder), Peru (amphetamine use disorder and cocaine use disorder), Chile and Suriname (amphetamine use disorder), Uruguay (CAD), and Bolivia (OUD). Overall, the cocaine use disorder burden stabilised then decreased. OUD was less prevalent than other substance use disorders but its burden was the highest. The decrease in the burden of cocaine use disorder probably reflects the success of national standardised treatment programmes. Programmes for amphetamine use disorder, CAD, and OUD management should be improved. We did not find an increase in CAD burden in Uruguay, the country with the highest degree of cannabis decriminalisation in the region. Countries in South America should improve monitoring of substance use disorders, including regular surveys to provide more accurate data on which to base policy decisions.

Governments and civil societies need population-based measures to monitor children's early development and ensure that children receive the care needed to thrive. To this end, the WHO developed the Global Scales for Early Development (GSED) to measure children's early development up to 3 years of age. The GSED includes three measures for population and programmatic level measurement: (1) short form (SF) (caregiver report), (2) long form (LF) (direct administration) and (3) psychosocial form (PF) (caregiver report). The primary aim of this protocol is to validate the GSED SF and LF. Secondary aims are to create preliminary reference scores for the GSED SF and LF, validate an adaptive testing algorithm and assess the feasibility and preliminary validity of the GSED PF. We will conduct the validation in seven countries (Bangladesh, Brazil, C&#xf4;te d'Ivoire, Pakistan, The Netherlands, People's Republic of China, United Republic of Tanzania), varying in geography, language, culture and income through a 1-year prospective design, combining cross-sectional and longitudinal methods with 1248 children per site, stratified by age and sex. The GSED generates an innovative common metric (Developmental Score: D-score) using the Rasch model and a Development for Age Z-score (DAZ). We will evaluate six psychometric properties of the GSED SF and LF: concurrent validity, predictive validity at 6&#x2009;months, convergent and discriminant validity, and test-retest and inter-rater reliability. We will evaluate measurement invariance by comparing differential item functioning and differential test functioning across sites. This study has received ethical approval from the WHO (protocol GSED validation 004583 20.04.2020) and approval in each site.

The WHO led Global Scales for Early Development (GSED) project aims to provide population and programmatic level measures of ECD for 0-3&#x2009;years that are valid, reliable and have psychometrically stable performance across geographical, cultural and language contexts. This paper reports on the creation of two measures: (1) the GSED Short Form (GSED-SF)-a caregiver reported measure for population-evaluation-self-administered with no training required and (2) the GSED Long Form (GSED-LF)-a directly administered/observed measure for programmatic evaluation-administered by a trained professional. We selected 807 psychometrically best-performing items using a Rasch measurement model from an ECD measurement databank which comprised 66&#x2009;075 children assessed on 2211 items from 18 ECD measures in 32 countries. From 766 of these items, in-depth subject matter expert judgements were gathered to inform final item selection. Specifically collected were data on (1) conceptual matches between pairs of items originating from different measures, (2) developmental domain(s) measured by each item and (3) perceptions of feasibility of administration of each item in diverse contexts. Prototypes were finalised through a combination of psychometric performance evaluation and expert consensus to optimally identify items. We created the GSED-SF (139 items) and GSED-LF (157 items) for tablet-based and paper-based assessments, with an optimal set of items that fit the Rasch model, met subject matter expert criteria, avoided conceptual overlap, covered multiple domains of child development and were feasible to implement across diverse settings. State-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative procedures were used to select of theoretically relevant and globally feasible items representing child development for children aged 0-3 years. GSED-SF and GSED-LF will be piloted and validated in children across diverse cultural, demographic, social and language contexts for global use.","D006801; D002648; D002675; D007600; D000077558; D011795; D002657; D011594","Humans; Child; Child, Preschool; Judgment; Big Data; Surveys and Questionnaires; Child Development; Psychometrics","001","10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31659-2; 10.1017/S0140525X10000063; 10.1126/science.328.5986.1627; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000273; 10.1179/146532808X335679; 10.1542/peds.2011-2421; 10.3390/ijerph18116117; 10.1186/s12963-017-0122-8; 10.1136/bmjgh-2019-001724; 10.12688/gatesopenres.13222.2; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.07.037; 10.1136/bmjgh-2018-000747; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2018.05.002","Competing interests: None declared.","Gareth McCray, Dana McCoy, Patricia Kariger, Magdalena Janus, Maureen M Black, Susan M Chang, Fahmida Tofail, Iris Eekhout, Marcus Waldman,  ..., Melissa Gladstone","Women and Children's Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK."

Headache disorders are the second-highest cause of disease burden worldwide. Historically, headache disorders have been treated by primary care and emergency physicians, often suboptimally. Our 2012 study identified further disparities in geographic distribution of United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties (UCNS)-certified headache subspecialists. This correlational population study explores the current geographic distribution of and changes in subspecialists by aggregating data from the UCNS, National Health Interview Survey, US Census, Bureau of Economic Analysis, and American Community Survey. In 2021, there were 692 UCNS-certified headache subspecialists. There continued to be higher subspecialist density in the Northeast (1:34,678) and Midwest (1:55,005), with the highest density in Vermont (1:12,510) and Connecticut (1:20,419). The highest absolute subspecialist increases were in the South (99), California (35), and Texas (25). The highest relative subspecialist increases were in the West (105%), Vermont (500%), and Mississippi (500%). The univariable regressions showed significant associations between number of subspecialists and adult headache population (R<sup>2</sup> &#xa0;=&#xa0;0.797, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), between subspecialist density and personal income (R<sup>2</sup> &#xa0;=&#xa0;0.935, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.033), and between growth in subspecialists and poverty rate (R<sup>2</sup> &#xa0;=&#xa0;0.553, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.022). However, the multivariable regressions showed that only the adult population was significantly associated with number of subspecialists (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> &#xa0;=&#xa0;0.806, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Overall, there has been substantial growth in the number of UCNS-certified headache subspecialists in the US, especially relative to growth in adult headache population. Subspecialist density continues to be highest in the Northeast and is associated with higher per capita personal income. However, there has been encouraging growth in geographies that previously had little to no access. These findings represent positive progress, but there is more to be done to both increase access to optimal headache care by subspecialists nationally and decrease geographic disparities in access to care.","D000328; D014481; D006801; D006261; D002568; D020773; D013781","Adult; United States; Humans; Headache; Certification; Headache Disorders; Texas",NA,"NA",NA,"Skyler L Kanegi, Noah L Rosen","Northwell Health Neuroscience Institute/Zucker School of Medicine, Hofstra University, Great Neck, New York, USA."

In the current study, we investigated whether the subjective experience of economic disadvantage among friends is associated with social difficulties and poorer mental health in early adolescence. We used latent change score modelling (LCSM) on data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, collected at ages 11 and 14 (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;12,995). Each LCSM modelled the mean of an outcome related to mental health and interpersonal difficulties at age 11 (including self-esteem, well-being, emotional difficulties, peer problems, bullying, victimisation and externalising difficulties), the change of the outcome from ages 11 to 14 and its predictors, including perceived income inequality among friends (i.e. perceiving oneself as belonging to a poorer family than the families of one's friends). Perceived income inequality predicted adverse mental health and a range of interpersonal difficulties during adolescence, even when controlling for objective family income. Follow-up analyses highlighted that, at 11&#x2009;years, young people who perceived themselves as belonging to poorer families than their friends reported worse well-being, self-esteem, internalising problems, externalising problems and victimisation at the same age (relative to those who perceived themselves as richer than or equal to their friends, or who did not know). Longitudinal analyses suggested that victimisation decreased from ages 11 to 14 to a greater extent for adolescents who perceived themselves as poorer than other adolescents. The salience of economic inequalities in proximal social environments (e.g. among friends) in early adolescence could further amplify the negative effects of economic disadvantage on mental health and behavioural difficulties during this period.","D006801; D000293; D002648; D008603; D015331; D001523; D007182; D006113","Humans; Adolescent; Child; Mental Health; Cohort Studies; Mental Disorders; Income; United Kingdom","WT107496/ Z/15/Z; MC_UU_00030/13; SWAG/076.G101400","10.1007/s12144-021-02232-2",NA,"Blanca Piera Pi-Sunyer, Jack L Andrews, Amy Orben, Lydia G Speyer, Sarah-Jayne Blakemore","Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."

For this systematic scoping review, we summarized authors' recommendations for improving child welfare. We conducted a systematic search (2010 to 2021) and included published reviews that addressed authors' recommendations for improving child welfare for children, youth, and families coming into contact with child welfare in high-income countries. A total of 4758 records was identified by the systematic search, 685 full-text articles were screened for eligibility, and 433 reviews were found to be eligible for this scoping review. Reviews were theoretically divided, with some review authors recommending reform efforts at the macro level (e.g., addressing poverty) and others recommending reform efforts at the practice level (e.g., implementing evidence-based parenting programs). Reform efforts across socioecological levels were summarized in this scoping review. An important next step is to formulate what policy solutions are likely to lead to the greatest improvement in safety and well-being for children and families involved in child welfare.","D002648; D000293; D006801; D002669; D004608; D011203; D007182; D008137","Child; Adolescent; Humans; Child Welfare; Eligibility Determination; Poverty; Income; Longitudinal Studies",NA,"10.1080/09540261.2016.1205001; 10.1258/jrsm.2011.110222; 10.1037/a0024768; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.192; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001349; 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2014.10.017; 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61707-9; 10.2105/AJPH.2017.304258; 10.2105/AJPH.2016.303545; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2019.104191; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2005.02.009; 10.1177/0025802414543855; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2009.01372.x; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2017.06.004; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2017.02.035; 10.1177/1524838017726427; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2015.09.018; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.05.001; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2016.11.028; 10.1086/644381; 10.2307/1602630; 10.1016/j.psi.2015.10.003; 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2018.03.021; 10.1080/13548506.2016.1271952; 10.1177/15248380211013131; 10.2471/BLT.08.057075; 10.1177/1524838014566718; 10.1186/s12889-015-2387-9; 10.1111/j.1468-0009.2011.00655.x; 10.1093/her/cyu012; 10.4073/csr.2015.10; 10.1007/s10567-017-0250-5; 10.1186/1471-2288-13-48; 10.1097/XEB.0000000000000050; 10.1093/humupd/dmh058; 10.4103/2249-4863.109934; 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2005.03621.x; 10.1186/s12916-015-0465-6; 10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00269; 10.1111/j.1471-1842.2009.00848.x; 10.1080/0312407X.2011.574145; 10.1080/15548732.2011.617272; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2019.03.012; 10.1007/s10826-011-9454-3; 10.1177/1049731515620843; 10.1007/s10560-012-0272-2; 10.1007/s11414-015-9480-9; 10.1007/s10560-019-00598-8; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2012.01.023; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2016.02.023; 10.1111/cfs.12832; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.104995; 10.1007/s10560-014-0346-4; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.08.017; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105260; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104762; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2013.10.008; 10.1007/s10560-020-00722-z; 10.1002/car.2607; 10.1177/15248380211013129; 10.1111/fcre.12222; 10.1080/15548732.2020.1814541; 10.1080/10522158.2019.1635938; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2013.11.013; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105714; 10.1177/0002716220980329; 10.1177/1524838019881707; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.08.016; 10.1080/10911359.2018.1466751; 10.1093/sw/swz029; 10.1177/0020872819897757; 10.1080/01612840.2018.1479902; 10.1016/j.cppeds.2015.08.004; 10.1606/1044-3894.4040; 10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2009.06.018; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105005; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104632; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2012.12.009; 10.1038/pr.2015.196; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2012.03.021; 10.1606/1044-3894.2015.96.22; 10.1080/15548732.2017.1355866; 10.1016/j.chc.2019.02.001; 10.1080/15548732.2018.1512933; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2014.02.004; 10.1177/1049731519832101; 10.1542/peds.2010-2297; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2015.12.014; 10.1007/s10488-020-01080-9; 10.1177/1077559516657637; 10.1093/cs/cds005; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2010.09.007; 10.1080/15548732.2019.1621234; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105834; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2016.10.043; 10.1080/15548732.2016.1140107; 10.1080/15332640.2014.947460; 10.1080/0145935X.2019.1656063; 10.18584/iipj.2013.4.2.2; 10.1111/fcre.12404; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.104957; 10.1007/s10560-014-0334-8; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2009.06.006; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2017.05.005; 10.1111/cfs.12002; 10.1016/j.drugpo.2015.05.025; 10.1080/15548730903563095; 10.1606/1044-3894.2015.96.7; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2019.104389; 10.11124/JBIES-20-00071; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2010.06.017; 10.1080/15548732.2017.1340221; 10.1080/15548732.2020.1814478; 10.1080/15548732.2014.948584; 10.1111/hsc.13335; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2018.10.014; 10.1080/13575279.2016.1199536; 10.1111/j.1365-2214.2011.01287.x; 10.1016/j.pedn.2020.05.009; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2011.02.007; 10.1177/1044389419847326; 10.1016/j.chc.2016.12.008; 10.1080/13575279.2019.1701413; 10.1080/09503153.2019.1704236; 10.1542/peds.2014-2279; 10.1002/car.1154; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2015.03.017; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2012.01.002; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2011.11.004; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2013.05.014; 10.1002/car.2385; 10.1080/09503153.2016.1162287; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105188; 10.1111/cfs.12236; 10.1080/10926755.2016.1149535; 10.1177/1049731513491835; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2016.10.017; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.08.025; 10.1080/19371918.2014.938388; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2012.02594.x; 10.1111/cfs.12301; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2017.09.020; 10.1007/s40653-019-0250-3; 10.1080/15433710802683796; 10.1111/cfs.12049; 10.1177/1524838016669503; 10.1111/ijsw.12323; 10.1007/s00127-021-02069-x; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105454; 10.1111/cfs.12208","The authors declare no conflict of interest.

However, the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 induces neurologic injury, including neurological and/or psychological symptoms, remain unclear. In this review, the available knowledge on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying COVID-19 was organized using the AOP framework. Four AOPs leading to neurological adverse outcomes (AO), anosmia, encephalitis, stroke, and seizure, were developed. Biological key events (KEs) identified to induce these AOs included binding to ACE2, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, hypoxia, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. The modularity of AOPs allows the construction of AOP networks to visualize core pathways and recognize neuroinflammation and BBB disruption as shared mechanisms. Furthermore, the impact on the neurological AOPs of COVID-19 by modulating and multiscale factors such as age, psychological stress, nutrition, poverty, and food insecurity was discussed. Organizing the existing knowledge along an AOP framework can represent a valuable tool to understand disease mechanisms and identify data gaps and potentially contribute to treatment, and prevention. This AOP-aligned approach also facilitates synergy between experts from different backgrounds, while the fast-evolving and disruptive nature of COVID-19 emphasizes the need for interdisciplinarity and cross-community research.","D006801; D000086382; D000073931; D000086402; D001812; D020521","Humans; COVID-19; Adverse Outcome Pathways; SARS-CoV-2; Blood-Brain Barrier; Stroke",NA,"10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30076-X; 10.1001/jamaneurol.2020.1127; 10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.031; 10.3389/fneur.2020.00308; 10.1016/j.dsx.2021.04.007; 10.1038/s41467-022-29521-z; 10.1002/etc.34; 10.1177/1073858420956905; 10.1080/10408363.2020.1860895; 10.1152/jn.00255.2022; 10.1007/s10072-021-05505-7; 10.31083/j.jin2103077; 10.1021/acschemneuro.1c00353; 10.3389/fpubh.2021.638605; 10.14573/altex.2102221; 10.1177/026119291604400504; 10.1080/09553002.2021.1884314; 10.1186/s12989-020-00344-4; 10.1089/aivt.2017.0013; 10.3233/JAD-201418; 10.1093/toxsci/kfu199; 10.1007/s00203-021-02606-x; 10.1056/NEJMoa2021436; 10.14573/altex.2112161; 10.1007/s11427-020-1637-5; 10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052; 10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7; 10.1038/s41586-020-2772-0; 10.1038/s41582-020-0398-3; 10.3389/fcell.2021.684874; 10.3390/jcm9051417; 10.1126/science.abd2985; 10.1038/s41593-020-00758-5; 10.1007/s00401-021-02314-2; 10.1016/j.nbd.2020.105131; 10.1016/j.nbd.2021.105561; 10.1016/S1474-4422(20)30308-2; 10.1056/NEJMc2033369; 10.1126/science.abm2052; 10.1038/s41421-021-00290-1; 10.1101/2021.02.09.430314; 10.1038/s41586-022-04702-4; 10.1177/1753425920954281; 10.1007/s00401-020-02190-2; 10.3390/cells9112360; 10.1016/j.stemcr.2021.12.011; 10.1002/jmv.25915; 10.3390/ijms22052681; 10.1056/NEJMc2019373; 10.1093/brain/awab148; 10.1007/s12028-021-01220-5; 10.1172/JCI84433; 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2008.07.023; 10.1186/s12974-021-02282-0; 10.1016/j.cytogfr.2021.02.002; 10.1212/WNL.0000000000010111; 10.1016/S0378-4274(98)00324-5; 10.1111/j.1750-3639.1990.tb00630.x; 10.1177/0960327107074589; 10.1016/S0301-0082(98)00069-0; 10.3390/ijerph8072980; 10.3390/brainsci3031109; 10.1002/glia.1107; 10.1385/MN:27:3:325; 10.2174/1568006043481284; 10.1177/1759091420954960; 10.1016/j.xcrm.2021.100288; 10.1016/j.bbi.2020.12.022; 10.1212/WNL.0000000000012530; 10.1016/S1474-4422(15)70016-5; 10.1007/s12035-020-02094-y; 10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100484; 10.1111/jth.14820; 10.1002/ana.24647; 10.1074/jbc.M311768200; 10.1093/femspd/ftaa033; 10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.044; 10.1038/s41591-020-0868-6; 10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.037; 10.1002/iid3.387; 10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102581; 10.1002/lary.29286; 10.1007/s11356-021-15588-6; 10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00210; 10.1016/j.cell.2022.01.024; 10.1007/s00405-021-07153-1; 10.3390/cells11193027; 10.37825/2239-9747.1007; 10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.062; 10.7150/ijbs.45072; 10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100127; 10.1146/annurev.immunol.021908.132528; 10.1155/2013/510396; 10.1172/JCI97229; 10.1016/j.clineuro.2020.105921; 10.3389/fcvm.2021.649922; 10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.104941; 10.26355/eurrev_202012_24210; 10.1111/epi.12550; 10.1016/j.msard.2020.102535; 10.1016/j.seizure.2018.04.023; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2019.04.038; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.02.007; 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2012.03703.x; 10.1007/s10072-020-04932-2; 10.3201/eid1002.030638; 10.1373/clinchem.2003.025437; 10.1002/etc.4124; 10.3390/jcm11154464; 10.31083/j.rcm2301028; 10.1186/s12879-022-07062-6; 10.15585/mmwr.mm7036e2; 10.1289/ehp.00108s3511; 10.1016/j.medj.2021.04.016; 10.1172/JCI139569; 10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.023; 10.1001/jama.2020.4621; 10.1093/humrep/deaa367; 10.2196/26477; 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.05.015; 10.1002/uog.23744; 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2021.108841; 10.1007/s10072-021-05068-7; 10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30287-X; 10.1007/s42399-020-00363-4; 10.1212/WNL.0000000000012930; 10.3233/JAD-200581; 10.1186/s40035-021-00237-2; 10.1093/gerona/glaa183; 10.1136/bmj.m1985; 10.3390/ijms22041687; 10.3389/fgene.2021.741175; 10.1093/gerona/glaa169; 10.1016/j.stem.2020.12.018; 10.1186/s13195-021-00850-3; 10.1093/brain/awab337; 10.1002/alz.056282; 10.1002/alz.056706; 10.3390/biology11010061; 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.1.102803.144141; 10.1155/2022/8111022; 10.1016/j.metabol.2019.153951; 10.3233/JAD-2011-110821; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.01.046; 10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.032; 10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105107; 10.1007/s11469-020-00330-z; 10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04399; 10.1001/jamainternmed.2022.1118; 10.1038/s41598-021-99610-4","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","Helena T Hogberg, Ann Lam, Elan Ohayon, Muhammad Ali Shahbaz, Laure-Alix Clerbaux, Anna Bal-Price, Sandra Coecke, Rachel Concha, Francesca De Bernardi,  ..., Magdalini Sachana","Environment Health and Safety Division, Environment Directorate, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), 75016 Paris, France."

NFTs are universally observed in aging, occurring with or without the concomitant accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (A&#x3b2;) in plaques that typifies Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common tauopathy. Primary age-related tauopathy (PART) is an A&#x3b2;-independent process that affects the medial temporal lobe in both cognitively normal and impaired subjects. Determinants of symptomology in subjects with PART are poorly understood and require clinicopathologic correlation; however, classical approaches to staging tau pathology have limited quantitative reproducibility. As such, there is a critical need for unbiased methods to quantitatively analyze tau pathology on the histological level. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) generate highly accurate and precise computer vision assessments of digitized pathology slides, yielding novel histology metrics at scale. Here, we performed a retrospective autopsy study of a large cohort (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;706) of human post-mortem brain tissues from normal and cognitively impaired elderly individuals with mild or no A&#x3b2; plaques (average age of death of 83.1&#xa0;yr, range 55-110). We utilized a CNN trained to segment NFTs on hippocampus sections immunohistochemically stained with antisera recognizing abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), which yielded metrics of regional NFT counts, NFT positive pixel density, as well as a novel graph-theory based metric measuring the spatial distribution of NFTs. We found that several AI-derived NFT metrics significantly predicted the presence of cognitive impairment in both the hippocampus proper and entorhinal cortex (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). When controlling for age, AI-derived NFT counts still significantly predicted the presence of cognitive impairment (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04 in the entorhinal cortex; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04 overall). In contrast, Braak stage did not predict cognitive impairment in either age-adjusted or unadjusted models. These findings support the hypothesis that NFT burden correlates with cognitive impairment in PART. Furthermore, our analysis strongly suggests that AI-derived metrics of tau pathology provide a powerful tool that can deepen our understanding of the role of neurofibrillary degeneration in cognitive impairment.","D006801; D000368; D016874; D001185; D012189; D015203; D016875; D024801; D000544; D058225; D060825","Humans; Aged; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Artificial Intelligence; Retrospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; tau Proteins; Tauopathies; Alzheimer Disease; Plaque, Amyloid; Cognitive Dysfunction","R01 NS086736; R01 AG062348; R01 AG054008; P30 AG066514; K01 AG070326; P50 AG005138; R01 NS095252","10.1212/WNL.42.3.631; 10.1007/s00018-007-7220-x; 10.1007/s00401-014-1349-0; 10.1590/S1980-57642015DN91000002; 10.1111/bpa.12248; 10.1093/jnen/nly132; 10.1016/j.jalz.2017.01.028; 10.1016/0197-4580(95)00021-6; 10.1016/S0197-4580(97)00074-2; 10.1016/j.conb.2019.11.008; 10.1007/s004010050780; 10.5414/NPP30056; 10.3233/JAD-160521; 10.1007/s00401-021-02379-z; 10.1093/brain/awr209; 10.1007/s004010051163; 10.1186/s40478-021-01233-3; 10.1016/j.legalmed.2016.08.007; 10.1002/alz.12321; 10.1001/archneur.56.6.713; 10.1046/j.0919-6544.2001.00425.x; 10.1111/j.1365-2559.2006.02513.x; 10.1038/s41592-018-0261-2; 10.1038/s41591-019-0508-1; 10.1016/j.ajpath.2019.05.007; 10.1038/s41467-019-10212-1; 10.1038/s41374-019-0202-4; 10.1186/s40478-022-01425-5; 10.1093/jnen/nlab005; 10.1186/s40478-022-01318-7; 10.1186/s40478-022-01365-0; 10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2644615; 10.1017/S1041610297004870; 10.1097/nen.0b013e31815c5efb; 10.1002/mds.27198; 10.1212/01.WNL.0000063311.58879.01; 10.1007/s00401-020-02197-9; 10.1007/s00401-021-02373-5; 10.1186/s40478-018-0619-9; 10.1007/s00702-016-1635-1; 10.1089/neu.2018.6348; 10.1002/ana.24711; 10.1111/nan.12197; 10.3390/ijms19030645; 10.1093/brain/awv081; 10.1002/cbic.201800288; 10.1007/s00018-019-03349-1; 10.1093/brain/awz403; 10.1093/jnen/nlaa153; 10.1001/jamaneurol.2013.3961; 10.1212/WNL.0000000000010454","G.F., J.Z., and C.C-C., serve as executive leadership for PerciseDx a private company.","Gabriel A Marx, Daniel G Koenigsberg, Andrew T McKenzie, Justin Kauffman, Russell W Hanson, Kristen Whitney, Maxim Signaevsky, Marcel Prastawa,  ..., Megan A Iida","Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, 1 Gustave L.

We estimate the percentage of individuals who own mobile phones in 33 African countries, identify a relationship between ownership and proximity to a health clinic (HC), and quantify inequities in ownership. We investigate basic mobile phones (BPs) and smartphones (SPs): SPs can connect to the internet, BPs cannot. We use nationally representative data collected in 2017-2018 from 44,224 individuals in Round 7 of the Afrobarometer surveys. We use Bayesian multilevel logistic regression models for our analyses. We find 82% of individuals in 33 countries own mobile phones: 42% BPs and 40% SPs. Individuals who live close to an HC have higher odds of ownership than those who do not (aOR: 1.31, Bayesian 95% highest posterior density [HPD] region: 1.24-1.39). Men, compared with women, have over twice the odds of ownership (aOR: 2.37, 95% HPD region: 1.96-2.84). Urban residents, compared with rural residents, have almost three times the odds (aOR: 2.66, 95% HPD region: 2.22-3.18) and, amongst mobile phone owners, nearly three times the odds of owning an SP (aOR: 2.67, 95% HPD region: 2.33-3.10). Ownership increases with age, peaks in 26-40 year olds, then decreases. Individuals under 30 are more likely to own an SP than a BP, older individuals more likely to own a BP than an SP. Probability of ownership decreases with the Lived Poverty Index; however, some of the poorest individuals own SPs. If the digital devices needed for mHealth interventions are not equally available within the population (which we have found is the current situation), rolling out mHealth interventions in Africa is likely to propagate already existing inequities in access to healthcare. Many healthcare systems in African countries are under-resourced. As a result, people, particularly those living in rural areas, often have to travel large distances to access the medical care they need. Mobile phone-based interventions (also known as mHealth) could make a substantial difference. In Africa, mHealth is already used to diagnose and treat diseases, increase adolescents&#x2019; use of sexual and reproductive health services, boost HIV prevention and treatment, and improve maternal and child healthcare. However, using mHealth services requires owning a basic mobile phone or, in some cases, a smartphone that can access the internet. While mobile phone ownership in Africa is increasing rapidly, data on who has them and what types of phones they have are limited. If geographic, income, or gender-based inequities exist, mHealth interventions may not be able to reach those who would benefit the most. To close this knowledge gap, Okano et al. analyzed data on the mobile phone ownership of people living in 33 of the 54 countries in Africa. They used mathematical models and data collected from 44,224 people in Afrobarometer, a continent-wide survey conducted between 2017 and 2018. Okano et al. estimated that 80% of African adults in these 33 countries owned a mobile phone, and half of these devices were smartphones. Although ownership levels varied between the 33 countries, there were substantial inequities that appeared across all of them. More men than women owned a mobile phone. Residents in urban areas and wealthy individuals were also more likely to have a mobile phone than people living in rural areas and poorer individuals, respectively. However, in some countries, the least wealthy were also found to sometimes own smartphones. Okano et al. also found that people living closer to a health clinic were more likely to have a mobile phone than those living further away. Mobile phone ownership was also higher between 26 to 40 year olds, and then decreased with age. In addition, people under 30 were more likely to have a smartphone, whereas older individuals were more likely to own a mobile phone that does not connect to the internet. These findings suggest that there are large inequities in mobile phone ownership.

Neither infection-related impacts nor psychosocial disruption were related to vaccine hesitancy after adjusting for related sociodemographic covariates. However, perceptions of higher quality care received during COVID-19 illness predicted decreased COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.

Addressing gender disparity, by involving fathers, mothers in law and other family members can significantly improve perinatal and maternal healthcare, including risk factors for poor perinatal mental health such as domestic violence and poor social support. This highlights the need to develop and implement gender-transformative (GT) interventions that seek to engage with men and reduce or overcome gender-based constraints. This scoping review aimed to highlight existing gender transformative interventions from LMIC that specifically aimed to address perinatal mental health (partner violence, anxiety or depression and partner support) and identify components of the intervention that were found to be useful and acceptable. This review follows the five-stage Arksey and O'Malley framework and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. Six papers that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review (four from Africa and two from Asia). Common components of gender transformative interventions across studies included couple-based interventions and discussion groups.

This study details the prevalence of youth at the intersection of parental incarceration and foster care, their demographic characteristics, and heterogeneity in their mental health. Data come from the 2019 Minnesota Student Survey with 112,157 eighth-, ninth-, and eleventh-grade students. Logistic regression with interactions between parental incarceration and foster care predict associated odds of youth's anxiety and depression; self-injurious behavior, suicidal ideation and attempt; and mental health diagnoses and treatment. Nearly 2&#xa0;% of students experienced both parental incarceration and foster care, with a disproportionate number of those identifying as youth of color, experiencing poverty, and/or living in rural communities. Both parental incarceration and foster care were separately linked with poor mental health, yet experiencing both was associated with higher odds of anxiety, depression, self-injury, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, diagnosis, and treatment. Youth with proximal multiplicative exposure (recent foster care and current parental incarceration) reported the most adverse mental health symptoms. The study emboldens what is known about the inequitable distribution of parental incarceration and foster care.

In most low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), healthcare workers depend on guidelines developed in high-income countries (HICs), yet many interventions validated in a HIC are ineffective when implemented in an LMIC. The variation in infrastructure, medical personnel, technology and environmental conditions exhibited in LMICs relative to HICs necessitates a careful appraisal of the evidence base used in clinical guideline recommendations. This review aims to map the use of resource-stratified guidelines across all fields of medicine. The review seeks to answer three questions for the identified guidelines: (1) what was the method of development, (2) have they been implemented and, if so, (3) have they been validated. The search strategy will aim to locate studies from inception to November 2021. An initial limited search of PubMed and Scopus was undertaken to identify articles on the topic. The text words contained in the titles and abstracts of relevant articles, and the index terms used to describe the articles were used to develop a full search strategy for PubMed and Scopus. This scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews.

Existing interventions, often developed in high income, Western settings, need substantial adaptation before they can be implemented in different contexts. The aim of this study was to explore perspectives on the role that context plays in the adaptation and implementation of interventions targeting caregivers of children with DDs across settings. The study question was applied to the Caregiver Skills Training (CST) programme of the World Health Organization specifically, as well as to stakeholder experiences with caregiver interventions more broadly. Two focus group discussions (FGDs; n = 15 participants) and 25 individual semi-structured interviews were conducted. Participants were caregivers of children with DDs and professionals involved in adapting or implementing the CST across five continents and different income settings. Data were analysed thematically. Four main themes were developed: 1) Setting the scene for adaptations; 2) Integrating an intervention into local public services; 3) Understanding the reality of caregivers; 4) Challenges of sustaining an intervention. Informants thought that contextual adaptations were key for the intervention to fit in locally, even more so than cultural factors. The socio-economic context of caregivers, including poverty, was highlighted as heavily affecting service access and engagement with the intervention. Competing health priorities other than DDs, financial constraints, and management of long-term collaborations were identified as barriers. This study validates the notion that attention to contextual factors is an essential part of the adaptation of caregiver interventions for children with DDs, by providing perspectives from different geographical regions. We recommend a stronger policy and research focus on contextual adaptations of interventions and addressing unmet socio-economic needs of caregivers.","D017028; D002648; D002658; D017144; D006801; D011203","Caregivers; Child; Developmental Disabilities; Focus Groups; Humans; Poverty","001","10.1016/j.ridd.2010.12.018; 10.1016/S2214-109X(18)30309-7; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002393; 10.1093/inthealth/ihaa044; 10.1002/aur.2276; 10.1093/ije/dyt191; 10.1097/MOP.0b013e32834cf082; 10.1111/j.1365-2753.2006.00674.x; 10.1177/1362361311422708; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001572; 10.2196/mental.5776; 10.3109/10673229.2012.649108; 10.1111/jrh.12229; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.08.004; 10.1111/j.1468-3148.2011.00680.x; 10.1111/jcpp.13404; 10.1542/peds.2015-0861; 10.1002/aur.1978; 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2009.01176.x; 10.1007/s12098-014-1474-8; 10.1016/S2215-0366(15)00388-0; 10.1111/j.1524-4733.2005.04054.x; 10.1186/s13012-018-0815-9; 10.1136/bmj.h1258; 10.1186/s13012-018-0842-6; 10.1186/1748-5908-8-90; 10.1186/1748-5908-8-65; 10.1186/s12913-016-1651-8; 10.1186/s13012-017-0552-5; 10.1007/s10488-007-0121-3; 10.1007/s10488-007-0144-9; 10.1023/a:1019902902119; 10.1037/0033-3204.43.4.531; 10.2147/NDT.S138430; 10.1007/BF01447045; 10.1017/gmh.2016.17; 10.1037/0003-066X.62.6.563; 10.1136/jech-2020-214468; 10.1111/j.1547-5069.2001.00253.x; 10.1353/sof.2006.0023; 10.1177/070674370505000206; 10.1177/1362361317716604; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2015.03.025; 10.1177/13623613211035228; 10.1111/jcpp.13405; 10.1007/s11013-016-9516-5; 10.1111/sode.12430; 10.21037/pm.2019.07.08; 10.1196/annals.1425.011; 10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30060-9; 10.1093/heapol/czp053; 10.1186/s13033-020-00379-2; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.04.005; 10.1093/heapol/czr038; 10.1093/inthealth/ihs037; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.01.012","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Zsofia Szlamka, Charlotte Hanlon, Bethlehem Tekola, Laura Pacione, Erica Salomone, Chiara Servili, Rosa A Hoekstra","Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."

Data came from the 2017 wave of the nationally-representative National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) in South Africa. We focused on a sample of 15-24-year-olds whose depressive symptoms were assessed using an adapted version of the 10-item Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. We examine how individual dimensions and indicators of the MPI relate to depression, in comparison to more conventional measures, including household income, subjective social standing, overcrowding and personal assets. Cross-sectional analyses were adjusted for clustering to account for sampling design. The MPI index was not associated with probable depression (OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.02, 95&#xa0;% CI 0.81-1.29). Only lack of access to the labour market emerged as a key individual dimension associated with probable depression (OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;5.29, 95&#xa0;% CI 1.70-16.47), a relationship driven by an increased odds for those not in employment, education or training. Lack of household assets, living in an informal dwelling and lower perceived social standing were also associated with increased odds for depression. No gender differences were noted. The study is cross-sectional and not suitable to examine the causal nature of the association between multidimensional poverty and depression. Poverty dimensions that measure youth's access to employment or training have a strong association with depression. Further research is needed to assess whether improved access to employment or training contributes to improving mental health among young South Africans.","D000293; D006801; D003430; D003863; D013019; D011203; D007182","Adolescent; Humans; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; South Africa; Poverty; Income",NA,"NA","Conflict of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.","E C Garman, M Avendano, R Araya, S Evans-Lacko, D McDaid, A Zimmerman, C Lund","Alan J Flisher Centre for Public Mental Health, Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, University of Cape Town, South Africa; Centre for Global Mental Health, Health Service and Population Research Department, King's Global Health Institute, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."

However, less is known about how naturally occurring community patterns of PAE (including light to moderate exposure) affect brain development, particularly in consideration of commonly occurring concurrent impacts of prenatal tobacco exposure (PTE). Three hundred thirty-two children (ages 8 to 12) living in South Africa's Cape Flats townships underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging. During pregnancy, their mothers reported alcohol and tobacco use, which was used to evaluate PAE and PTE effects on their children's brain structure. Analyses involved the main effects of PAE and PTE (and their interaction) and the effects of PAE and PTE quantity on cortical thickness, surface area, and volume. After false-discovery rate (FDR) correction, PAE was associated with thinner left parahippocampal cortices, while PTE was associated with smaller cortical surface area in the bilateral pericalcarine, left lateral orbitofrontal, right posterior cingulate, right rostral anterior cingulate, left caudal middle frontal, and right caudal anterior cingulate gyri. There were no PAE&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;PTE interactions nor any associations of PAE and PTE exposure on volumetrics that survived FDR correction. PAE was associated with reduction in the structure of the medial temporal lobe, a brain region critical for learning and memory. PTE had stronger and broader associations, including with regions associated with executive function, reward processing, and emotional regulation, potentially reflecting continued postnatal exposure to tobacco (i.e., second-hand smoke exposure). These differential effects are discussed with respect to reduced PAE quantity in our exposed group versus prior studies within this geographical location, the deep poverty in which participants live, and the consequences of apartheid and racially and economically driven payment practices that contributed to heavy drinking in the region. Longer-term follow-up is needed to determine potential environmental and other moderators of the brain findings here and assess the extent to which they endure over time.","D002648; D006801; D005260; D011247; D014026; D013019; D000089822; D011297; D001921; D000431","Child; Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Nicotiana; South Africa; Birth Cohort; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Brain; Ethanol","U01 HD045935; U01 HD045991; U01 HD055154; U01 HD055155; U01 AA016501; R01 AA025653; K01 AA026889","NA",NA,"Andrew T Marshall, Stefanie C Bodison, Kristina A Uban, Shana Adise, Deborah Jonker, Weslin Charles, Kirsten A Donald, Eric Kan, Jonathan C Ipser,  ..., Elizabeth R Sowell","Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA."

Use of solid fuels generates household air pollution, which was associated with more than 2 million deaths in 2019. Although local patterns in cooking vary systematically, subnational trends in use of solid fuels have yet to be comprehensively analysed. We estimated the prevalence of solid-fuel use with high spatial resolution to explore subnational inequalities, assess local progress, and assess the effects on health in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) without universal access to clean fuels. We did a geospatial modelling study to map the prevalence of solid-fuel use for cooking at a 5 km&#x2008;&#xd7;&#x2008;5 km resolution in 98 LMICs based on 2&#xb7;1 million household observations of the primary cooking fuel used from 663 population-based household surveys over the years 2000 to 2018. We use observed temporal patterns to forecast household air pollution in 2030 and to assess the probability of attaining the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target indicator for clean cooking. We aligned our estimates of household air pollution to geospatial estimates of ambient air pollution to establish the risk transition occurring in LMICs. Finally, we quantified the effect of residual primary solid-fuel use for cooking on child health by doing a counterfactual risk assessment to estimate the proportion of deaths from lower respiratory tract infections in children younger than 5 years that could be associated with household air pollution. Although primary reliance on solid-fuel use for cooking has declined globally, it remains widespread. 593 million people live in districts where the prevalence of solid-fuel use for cooking exceeds 95%. 66% of people in LMICs live in districts that are not on track to meet the SDG target for universal access to clean energy by 2030. Household air pollution continues to be a major contributor to particulate exposure in LMICs, and rising ambient air pollution is undermining potential gains from reductions in the prevalence of solid-fuel use for cooking in many countries. We estimated that, in 2018, 205&#x2008;000 (95% uncertainty interval 147&#x2008;000-257&#x2008;000) children younger than 5 years died from lower respiratory tract infections that could be attributed to household air pollution. Efforts to accelerate the adoption of clean cooking fuels need to be substantially increased and recalibrated to account for subnational inequalities, because there are substantial opportunities to improve air quality and avert child mortality associated with household air pollution.

Although early nutrition (e.g., breastfeeding) is positively correlated with IQ in children born VLBW, the association between dietary intake in childhood and cognitive performance is unknown. Thus, our study is the first to investigate the relationship between diet quality, as measured by the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) and cognitive performance in a Canadian cohort of 5-year-old children born VLBW (<i>n</i> = 158; 47% female). Diet quality was measured using two 24-h diet recalls obtained from parents and cognitive performance was assessed using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-IV (WPPSI-IV). To account for additional sociodemographic factors that could influence neurodevelopment, linear regression analyses were adjusted for sex, household income above/below the poverty line, maternal education, birth weight and breastfeeding duration. Mean &#xb1; SD HEI-2010 score was 58.2 &#xb1; 12.4, with most children (67%) having diets in ""need of improvement"" (scores 51-80). HEI-2010 scores were not significantly associated with IQ or any other WPPSI-IV composite score. Significant predictors of IQ in our model were birth weight, sex, and maternal education.

Despite various schemes previously implemented to address snare setting-an activity that is fueled by poverty, the problem and its detrimental impact on chimpanzees persists. Here, we experimentally tested a novel intervention, a systematic display of specially designed warning signs aimed at local poachers. We monitored the presence of snares before and after introducing these signs over a total period of two years and compared it with that of a similar sized control area with no intervention.

Adolescents are vulnerable to common mental disorders with depression and self-harm accounting for a major share of the burden of death and disability in this age group. Around 20% of children and adolescents are diagnosed with/ or live with a disabling mental illness. A national survey has found that suicide is the third leading cause of death among adolescents in India. The authors hypothesise that an intervention involving an anti-stigma campaign co-created by adolescents themselves, and a mobile technology-based electronic decision support system will help reduce stigma, depression, and suicide risk and improve mental health for high-risk adolescents living in urban slums in India. The intervention will be implemented as a cluster randomised control trial in 30 slum clusters in each of the cities of Vijayawada and New Delhi in India. Adolescents aged 10 to 19 years will be screened for depression and suicide ideation using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Two evaluation cohorts will be derived-a high-risk cohort with an elevated PHQ-9 score &#x2265; 10 and/or a positive response (score &#x2265; 2) to the suicide risk question on the PHQ-9, and a non-high-risk cohort comprising an equal number of adolescents not at elevated risk based on these scores. The key elements that ARTEMIS will focus on are increasing awareness among adolescents and the slum community on these mental health conditions as well as strengthening the skills of existing primary healthcare workers and promoting task sharing. The findings from this study will provide evidence to governments about strategies with potential for addressing the gaps in providing care for adolescents living in urban slums and experiencing depression, other significant emotional or medically unexplained complaints or increased suicide risk/self-harm and should have relevance not only for India but also for other low- and middle-income countries.

How do the social conditions of poverty get under the skin to influence biology, and through what mechanisms do the stressors of poverty generate risk for a broad range of health problems? The growing field examining the neuroscience of socioeconomic status (SES) proposes that the brain is an entry point or pathway through which poverty and adversity become embedded in biology to generate these disparities. To date, however, the majority of research on the neuroscience of SES has focused on cognitive or executive control processes. However, the relationship between SES and brain systems involved in affective or emotional processes may be especially important for understanding social determinants of health. Accordingly, this Special Focus on The Affective Neuroscience of Poverty invited contributions from authors examining the relationship between SES and brain systems involved in generating and regulating emotions. In this editorial introduction, we (a) provide an overview of the neuroscience of SES; (b) introduce each of the articles in this Special Focus; and (c) discuss the scientific, treatment, and policy implications of studying the affective neuroscience of poverty.","D001921; D056344; D006801; D009488; D011203; D012923","Brain; Executive Function; Humans; Neurosciences; Poverty; Social Class","R01 MH123473; P50 DA051361","NA",NA,"Robin Nusslock, Martha J Farah","University of Pennsylvania."

Core traits can range from subtle to severe and fluctuate depending on context. Individuals can present for diagnostic assessments during childhood or adulthood. However, waiting times for assessment are typically lengthy, and many individuals wait months or even years to be seen. Traditionally, there has been a lack of standardization between services regarding how many and which multidisciplinary health professionals are involved in the assessment and the methods (diagnostic tools) that are used. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected routine service provision because of stay-at-home mandates and social distancing guidelines. Autism diagnostic services have had to adapt, such as by switching from conducting assessments in person to doing these fully via telehealth (defined as the use of remote technologies for the provision of health care) or using blended in-person or telehealth methods. This study explored health professionals' experiences of and perspectives about conducting telehealth autism diagnostic assessments, including barriers and facilitators to this, during the COVID-19 pandemic; potential telehealth training and supervision needs of health professionals; how the quality and effectiveness of telehealth autism diagnostic services can be enhanced; and experiences of delivering postdiagnostic support remotely. A total of 45 health professionals, working in varied settings across England, participated in one-off, in-depth semistructured qualitative interviews. These were conducted via videoconferencing or telephone. Altogether, participants represented 7 professional disciplines (psychiatry, medicine, psychology, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, nursing, and social work). The data were then analyzed thematically. Thematic analysis indicated the following 7 themes: practicalities of telehealth, telehealth autism diagnostic assessments, diagnostic conclusions, clinical considerations, postdiagnostic support, future ways of working, and health professionals' experiences and needs. Overall, telehealth autism diagnostic assessments were deemed by many participants to be convenient, flexible, and efficient for some patients, families, and health professionals. However, not all patients could be assessed in this way, for example, because of digital poverty, complex clinical presentation, or concerns about risk and safeguarding. Working remotely encouraged innovation, including the development of novel assessment measures. However, some participants expressed significant concerns about the validity and reliability of remotely assessing social communication conditions. A shift to telehealth meant that autism diagnostic services remained operational during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this method of working has potentially affected the parity of service, with people presenting with clinical complexity having to potentially wait longer to be seen or given a diagnostic opinion. There is also a lack of standardization in the provision of services. Further research should identify evidence-based ways of enhancing the timeliness, accessibility, and robustness of the autism diagnostic pathway, as well as the validity and reliability of telehealth methods.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.0054; 10.1007/s10803-016-2886-2; 10.1016/S2215-0366(15)00277-1; 10.1186/s12888-018-1800-1; 10.1177/13623613211015757; 10.1177/1362361316685879?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed; 10.1177/1362361316685879; 10.1111/j.1475-3588.2012.00664.x; 10.1186/s12889-020-09301-4; 10.1007/s10803-021-04950-9; 10.1016/j.rasd.2021.101859; 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.789449; 10.1371/journal.pone.0249237; 10.1007/s10803-022-05435-z; 10.1371/journal.pone.0236415; 10.1007/s10567-021-00358-0; 10.1002/aur.2591; 10.1007/s10803-021-05112-7; 10.1007/s10803-021-04960-7; 10.1007/s10803-021-05395-w; 10.1093/intqhc/mzm042; 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; 10.1177/1468794112468475; 10.1007/BF02172145; 10.3390/ijerph182211812; 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02201; 10.1177/1476718X211052789; 10.1177/1476718x211052789; 10.1111/camh.12545; 10.2196/33819; 10.1136/emermed-2020-210896; 10.2196/24021; 10.1016/j.rasd.2021.101747","Conflicts of Interest: None declared.","Debbie Spain, Gavin R Stewart, David Mason, Victoria Milner, Bryony Fairhurst, Janine Robinson, Nicola Gillan, Ian Ensum, Eloise Stark, Francesca Happe","Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."

Addressing stigmatization requires adequate measurement. Our systematic review synthesizes the content of scales used with children and adolescents in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) across stigmas, and examines their comparability and level of cultural adaptation. Ten databases were systematically searched combining three sets of search terms: (i) stigma, (ii) scales, and (iii) LMICs. Studies conducted in LMICs, with a sample with mean age below 18 and reporting a minimum of one stigma scale, were eligible. We allocated scale items to four frameworks: (i) dimensions, or drivers of stigmatization; (ii) target variants, or types of stigmatization; (iii) socio-ecological levels, and (iv) cross-cultural equivalence, or scale adaptation to context/population. Based on percentages, we compared scale content per age cohort, stigma status, region, and stigma category. Out of 14,348 records, we included 93 articles (112 scales). Most studies focused on adolescents (12-18 years). Twelve scales were used more than once, seven were used across regions, and four were employed for multiple stigmas. Physical health stigma, and HIV/AIDS-related stigma in particular, was measured most; mental health and multiple/generic stigmas least. Physical and mental health scales were generally more comprehensive, i.e., measuring more stigma facets. In general, scales consistently measured two of the 21 included stigma facets, namely the disruptiveness dimension and the community level. Cross-cultural equivalence was moderate; conceptual and measurement equivalence were high. Although scales were largely comparable in how they measure stigma, they failed to reflect the complexity of the stigmatization process and fell short of existing stigma frameworks and qualitative research. Stigma research with children should work towards cross-culturally validated stigma scale sets which incorporate more facets of existing stigma frameworks, thus facilitating comparability across cultural contexts and informing intervention development and evaluation.","D000163; D000293; D002648; D003906; D006801; D011203; D057545; D013240","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Adolescent; Child; Developing Countries; Humans; Poverty; Social Stigma; Stereotyping","R01 MH120649","NA",NA,"Luana Gavan, Kim Hartog, Gabriela V Koppenol-Gonzalez, Petra C Gronholm, Allard R Feddes, Brandon A Kohrt, Mark J D Jordans, Ruth M H Peters","Vrije Universiteit, Faculty of Science, Athena Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."

Embase, Econlit, Global Health, MEDLINE, APA PsychINFO, and Social Policy and Practice were searched for experimental and quasi-experimental studies which investigated the impact of employment programs on primary and secondary outcomes of a CMD.

This review highlights the potential for employment programs and other poverty-reduction interventions to be utilized and integrated into the wider care, prevention, and treatment of common-mental disorders.","D004651; D006801; D001523; D010865; D011203; D016032; D012189","Employment; Humans; Mental Disorders; Pilot Projects; Poverty; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Retrospective Studies",NA,"10.1007/s11920-018-0969-9; 10.1002/wps.20860; 10.3233/jvr-2011-0553; 10.1111/j.2044-8341.1985.tb02617.x; 10.1016/S2215-0366(19)30397-9; 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047781; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.01.020; 10.1136/bmjgh-2016-000165; 10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32279-7; 10.3390/ijerph18010279; 10.1001/jama.298.16.1900; 10.1093/heapol/czw170; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.04.027; 10.1016/j.jad.2017.12.050; 10.1176/appi.ps.201300262; 10.1192/bjp.bp.115.165092; 10.1080/17441692.2016.1170181; 10.1007/s00038-014-0570-x; 10.1093/heapol/czy020; 10.1136/bmj.n71; 10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub2; 10.1002/14651858.CD011849.pub2; 10.1016/j.ypmed.2011.11.015; 10.1007/s11920-019-0997-0; 10.1126/science.aay0214; 10.1016/S2215-0366(15)00505-2; 10.1007/s00127-017-1370-4; 10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004661",NA,"Libby Evans, Crick Lund, Alessandro Massazza, Hannah Weir, Daniela C Fuhr","Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, material hardship (i.e., difficulty paying for basic needs) in families of young children has had detrimental effects on caregivers' and children's well-being. In addition to the degree of material hardship, the week-to-week and month-to-month unpredictability of hardship status may add to families' stress and worsen well-being. This study examined the magnitude of and mechanisms underlying the effects of material hardship level and unpredictability on the well-being of U.S. households with young children during the pandemic. Data were drawn from the RAPID project, a large ongoing national study that used weekly/biweekly online surveys to investigate the pandemic impact on U.S. households with young children. The current study leveraged data from 4621 families who provided at least three responses between April 2020 and October 2021. Findings indicated that racial/ethnic minorities and lower-income households experienced higher levels of material hardship and unpredictability during the pandemic, compared to their White or higher-income counterparts. Levels of pandemic-related material hardship and hardship unpredictability were both significantly associated with worsened well-being among caregivers and children. Finally, the effects of hardship level and unpredictability on well-being outcomes were partially mediated through disrupted family routines. The findings from this study highlight that ensuring equal and adequate access to financial resources, as well as promoting financial stability for households with young children are both critical for maintaining functional family dynamics and promoting caregivers' and children's optimal well-being.","D000086382; D002648; D002675; D005191; D006801; D007182; D058873; D011203","COVID-19; Child; Child, Preschool; Family Characteristics; Humans; Income; Pandemics; Poverty","P50 DA048756","NA","None.","Sihong Liu, Maureen Zalewski, Liliana Lengua, Megan R Gunnar, Nicole Giuliani, Philip A Fisher","Stanford Center on Early Childhood, Graduate School of Education, Stanford University, USA."

However, with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) becoming a global crisis, the risks posed by widespread antimicrobial use need to be evaluated. As the role of the environment in AMR emergence and dissemination has become increasingly recognized, it is likewise crucial to establish the role of MDA in environmental AMR pollution, along with the potential impacts of such pollution. This review presents the current state of knowledge on the antimicrobial compounds, resistant organisms, and antimicrobial resistance genes in MDA trials, routes of these determinants into the environment, and their persistence and ecological impacts, particularly in low and middle-income countries where these trials are most common. From the few studies directly evaluating AMR outcomes in azithromycin MDA trials, it is becoming apparent that MDA efforts can increase carriage and excretion of resistant pathogens in a lasting way. However, research on these outcomes for other antimicrobials used in MDA trials is sorely needed. Furthermore, while paths of AMR determinants from human waste to the environment and their persistence thereafter are supported by the literature, quantitative information on the scope and likelihood of this is largely absent. We recommend some mitigative approaches that would be valuable to consider in future MDA efforts. This review stands to be a valuable resource for researchers and policymakers seeking to evaluate the impacts of MDA.","D000900; D000890; D024881; D004777; D006801; D000074381","Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Infective Agents; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Environment; Humans; Mass Drug Administration","T32ES007018","10.1098/rstb.2013.0434; 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60233-6; 10.1016/S2214-109X(21)00417-4; 10.4269/ajtmh.18-0846; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0007315; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010096; 10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30053-2; 10.1586/14787210.7.1.37; 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.02.020; 10.1016/j.microc.2017.02.006; 10.3201/eid0804.010312; 10.1016/j.copbio.2008.05.006; 10.1016/S1473-3099(12)70317-1; 10.1016/S0140-6736(98)12387-5; 10.1056/NEJMoa1408586; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003988; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000377; 10.1093/clinids/24.3.356; 10.1093/ije/dyu062; 10.3389/fmicb.2016.01420; 10.1016/S1473-3099(18)30444-4; 10.1056/NEJMc1901535; 10.1056/NEJMoa2002606; 10.1016/j.tim.2006.02.006; 10.1056/NEJMc1910014; 10.1097/QCO.0000000000000312; 10.1097/QCO.0b013e328358993a; 10.2147/IDR.S332378; 10.1136/bmj.j4307; 10.1016/j.pt.2004.07.010; 10.1056/NEJMoa1314981; 10.1016/j.pt.2003.08.003; 10.1016/S1473-3099(16)30269-9; 10.2147/IDR.S123887; 10.1186/s12936-019-2906-8; 10.1093/cid/ciw283; 10.1371/journal.pone.0225464; 10.4269/ajtmh.16-0508; 10.1186/s13690-020-00517-9; 10.1007/s12199-015-0468-0; 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00473-0; 10.1016/S1473-3099(13)70318-9; 10.1016/j.watres.2020.116455; 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.01.032; 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02724-0; 10.1016/S2542-5196(20)30099-1; 10.1016/S0009-9236(97)90098-9; 10.1007/BF00608219; 10.2165/00003088-200039040-00002; 10.1208/s12248-007-9000-9; 10.1007/BF03189418; 10.3389/fmicb.2016.01728; 10.1016/j.envint.2015.10.001; 10.1021/es903490h; 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.05.130; 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.12.065; 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.07.059; 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.136505; 10.1128/AEM.01978-18; 10.1038/s41893-018-0167-0; 10.1021/acs.est.1c02168; 10.1021/acs.est.6b06019; 10.1371/journal.pone.0047005; 10.1038/ismej.2014.191; 10.1128/mSphere.00329-20; 10.1371/journal.pone.0212510; 10.1016/j.envpol.2015.11.035; 10.1186/s40168-017-0369-0; 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002158; 10.1038/ismej.2016.194; 10.2471/BLT.19.234310; 10.3390/molecules23040795; 10.1016/j.ecolind.2007.06.002; 10.1016/j.envint.2018.02.003; 10.1016/j.aquatox.2005.09.009; 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.10.331; 10.1016/j.baae.2016.01.001; 10.1038/327418a0; 10.1016/j.biocon.2008.04.011; 10.1038/srep13912; 10.1093/jac/dky548; 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112496; 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.10.043; 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110573; 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.432; 10.1111/are.13191; 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.03.139; 10.1016/j.talanta.2014.12.035; 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.09.004; 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.08.218; 10.1139/cjm-2017-0642; 10.1038/nature10571; 10.1038/nature17672; 10.1038/nrmicro3399; 10.1016/j.tim.2016.11.014; 10.1038/s41564-020-0722-0; 10.1016/j.wroa.2020.100045; 10.1016/j.envint.2018.07.004; 10.1017/ice.2015.44; 10.3389/fmicb.2017.02200; 10.1021/acs.est.7b03380; 10.1002/wer.1248; 10.1080/10934529.2012.637432; 10.1186/s13756-021-00922-x; 10.1016/j.ajic.2020.04.011; 10.1093/cid/ciz893; 10.2471/BLT.20.258905; 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140719; 10.3390/tropicalmed6020105; 10.1371/journal.pone.0096658; 10.1016/j.envint.2015.10.015","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Joanna K Konopka, Pranab Chatterjee, Connor LaMontagne, Joe Brown","Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599-7431, USA."

However, limited research has examined whether stress responses relate to adolescent substance use, especially among adolescents from ethnic minority and high-adversity backgrounds. The present study assessed whether blunted emotional and cortisol responses to stress at age 14 related to substance use by ages 14 and 16, and whether associations varied by poverty status and sex. A sample of 277 Mexican-origin youth (53.19% female; 68.35% below the poverty line) completed a social-evaluative stress task, which was culturally adapted for this population, and provided saliva samples and rated their anger, sadness, and happiness throughout the task. They also reported whether they had ever used alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes, and vaping of nicotine at age 14 and again at age 16. Multilevel models suggested that blunted cortisol reactivity to stress was associated with alcohol use by age 14 and vaping nicotine by age 16 among youth above the poverty line. Also, blunted sadness and happiness reactivity to stress was associated with use of marijuana and alcohol among female adolescents. Blunted stress responses may be a risk factor for substance use among youth above the poverty line and female adolescents.","D006801; D000293; D005260; D008297; D005006; D009538; D006854; D008913; D019966; D013315","Humans; Adolescent; Female; Male; Ethnicity; Nicotine; Hydrocortisone; Minority Groups; Substance-Related Disorders; Stress, Psychological","T32 DA017629; R01 ES017054; P01 ES009605; F31 DA051181; R01 DA035300","10.1046/j.1360-0443.2003.00496.x; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.12.032; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2013.04.002; 10.1007/s10802-017-0311-8; 10.1186/2042-6410-3-14; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2021.105365; 10.2105/AJPH.90.3.407; 10.1016/S0006-3223(03)00705-4; 10.1016/j.cpr.2007.10.001; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2007.05.002; 10.1007/s00213-010-2007-4; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.02.025; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2005.02.010; 10.1016/j.bbi.2017.06.015; 10.1136/jech-2014-204164; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.11.007; 10.2105/AJPH.2003.037051; 10.1176/appi.ajp.157.5.745; 10.1037/0033-2909.130.3.355; 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2020.09.013; 10.5993/AJHB.42.5.8; 10.1542/peds.111.5.949; 10.3109/713610244; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2019.1475; 10.15288/jsad.2016.77.208; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2012.05.031; 10.1371/journal.pone.0061724; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2017.10.009; 10.1046/j.1360-0443.2002.00103.x; 10.1111/psyp.12017; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.02.030; 10.1016/S0899-3289(97)90009-2; 10.1017/S0033291705006045; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2008.08.013; 10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.03.046; 10.1016/S0022-3999(02)00553-6; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2013.05.009; 10.1007/978-3-030-17332-6_3; 10.1007/s10802-008-9291-z; 10.1001/archpedi.160.7.739; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.08.015; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2006.01570.x; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02685.x; 10.1016/j.envres.2021.111908; 10.3791/55393; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2020.104828; 10.3998/2027.42/150621; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.07071050; 10.1037/adb0000217; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2019.05.002; 10.3109/10826084.2015.1058826; 10.15585/mmwr.ss6708a1; 10.1016/j.jbtep.2007.02.003; 10.1159/000119004; 10.1016/j.paid.2016.05.011; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.05030503; 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093548; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.04.028; 10.1159/000333036; 10.1111/add.12980; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.10.267; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2009.04.006; 10.1037/1064-1297.10.3.310; 10.1007/s10964-017-0790-5; 10.1037/a0024244; 10.1037/0022-3514.81.1.146; 10.1177/1073191119885019; 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2005.10.007; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2010.01.006; 10.15288/jsad.2018.79.761; 10.1542/peds.2009-3450; 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2019-055052; 10.1016/j.bbi.2009.08.009; 10.1016/S0006-3223(98)00216-9; 10.1080/15374410902976320; 10.2307/3315184; 10.1097/00004583-200402000-00010; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.06.017; 10.15288/jsad.2012.73.772; 10.1017/S0954579415000875; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2015.07.001; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.07.215; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.07.006; 10.1177/1359105317713359; 10.1007/s10608-015-9729-x; 10.1016/j.brat.2019.103475; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08030412; 10.1016/S1054-139X(03)00350-1; 10.15585/mmwr.mm6440a2; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2011.06.014; 10.1016/j.ntt.2015.08.001; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.05.021; 10.1080/13676261.2012.685707; 10.1111/2041-210X.13434; 10.1111/dar.12260; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.04.017; 10.1002/dev.20336; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2020.105067; 10.1521/pedi.2014.28.1.40; 10.1037/0893-164X.16.1.72; 10.1037/a0016003; 10.1007/s002130100917; 10.1017/S0954579409000066; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2006.01.006; 10.1016/j.neuro.2016.07.010; 10.1073/pnas.0409174102; 10.1093/alcalc/agx027; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02246.x; 10.1136/jech-2016-208503; 10.1111/ajad.12530; 10.1177/1077559513520466; 10.1007/s10578-018-0784-x; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03448.x; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2004.06.009; 10.1016/j.ynstr.2019.100148; 10.1037/0893-164X.18.2.122; 10.1038/s41398-019-0406-9; 10.1111/adb.12135; 10.3390/brainsci9040076; 10.1177/0165025413515405","Conflicts of Interest: None","Danny Rahal, Elizabeth A Shirtcliff, Andrew Fuligni, Katherine Kogut, Nancy Gonzales, Megan Johnson, Brenda Eskenazi, Julianna Deardorff","Center for Environmental Research and Children's Health, Berkeley School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA."

It has been shown to be a powerful predictor of many developmental outcomes and to mitigate the impact of risk conditions. However, longitudinal studies on MM reporting changes over time and individual differences among mothers have been scant and quite inconclusive, mainly due to the investigation of changes between only two time points. The current study analyzes MM's developmental trajectories across four time points (3, 6, 9, and 12 months of infants' age) along with the moderating effects of four variables (maternal sensitivity, age, education, and family income). The sample included healthy mother-infant dyads (<i>N</i> = 93, 46 female infants), belonging to monolingual Italian predominantly middle-class families, with 15% (<i>n</i> = 14) classified as low income (below the relative poverty threshold). The dyads were videotaped during semistructured play interactions and transcripts were coded for appropriate mind-related comments (AMRCs) and nonattuned mind-related comments (NAMRCs). Mothers' AMRCs, compared to NAMRCs, showed more temporal stability. Both AMRCs and NAMRCs showed a linear decrease with individual differences across dyads decreasing over time, and dyads becoming increasingly similar one with the other. Low income moderated the normative trend of appropriate mind-related comments. These findings suggest that MM, while depending largely on an individual trait at earlier ages, when infants' mental states are less intelligible, adapts to the increase of infants' sociocommunicative repertoire over time. They also highlight the importance of ecological constraints on the quality of caregiving.

Several effective interventions can ameliorate this situation. However, the magnitude of the education gap in schizophrenia and its change over time are unclear. We aimed to reconstruct the trajectories of educational attainment in patients with schizophrenia and, if reported, their healthy comparator controls. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis including all studies reporting on patients with schizophrenia (of mean age &#x2265;18 years) and describing the number of years of education of the participants, with or without healthy controls. There were no other design constraints on studies. We excluded studies that included only patients with other schizophrenia spectrum disorders and studies that did not specify the number of years of education of the participants. 22 reviewers participated in retrieving data from a search in PubMed and PsycINFO (Jan 1, 1970, to Nov 24, 2020). We estimated the birth date of participants from their mean age and publication date, and meta-analysed these data using random-effects models, focusing on educational attainment, the education gap, and changes over time. The primary outcome was years of education. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020220546). From 32&#x2008;593 initial references, we included 3321 studies reporting on 318&#x2008;632 patients alongside 138&#x2008;675 healthy controls (170&#x2008;941 women and 275&#x2008;821 men from studies describing sex or gender; data on ethnicity were not collected). Patients' educational attainment increased over time, mirroring that of controls. However, patients with schizophrenia in high-income countries had 19 months less education than controls (-1&#xb7;59 years, 95% CI -1&#xb7;66 to -1&#xb7;53; p&lt;0&#xb7;0001), which is equivalent to a Cohen's d of -0&#xb7;56 (95% CI -0&#xb7;58 to -0&#xb7;54) and implies an odds ratio of 2&#xb7;58 for not completing 12 years of education (ie, not completing secondary education) for patients compared with controls. This gap remained stable throughout the decades; the rate of change in number of total years of education in time was not significant (annual change: 0&#xb7;0047 years, 95% CI -0&#xb7;0005 to 0&#xb7;0099; p=0&#xb7;078). For patients in low-income and middle-income countries, the education gap was significantly smaller than in high-income countries (smaller by 0&#xb7;72 years, 0&#xb7;85 to 0&#xb7;59; p&lt;0&#xb7;0001), yet there was evidence that this gap was widening over the years, approaching that of high-income countries (annual change: -0&#xb7;024 years, -0&#xb7;037 to -0&#xb7;011; p=0&#xb7;0002). Patients with schizophrenia have faced persistent inequality in educational attainment in the last century, despite advances in psychosocial and pharmacological treatment. Reducing this gap should become a priority to improve their functional outcomes.

However, decades of unfortunate historical, sociocultural and leadership challenges make the continent a hotspot for poverty, indoor and outdoor pollutants with attendant stress factors such as violence, malnutrition, infectious outbreaks and psychological perturbations. The burden of these stressors initiate neuroinflammatory responses but the pattern and mechanisms of glial activation in these scenarios are yet to be properly elucidated. Africa is therefore most vulnerable to neurological stressors when placed against a backdrop of demographics that favor explosive childbearing, a vast population of unemployed youths making up a projected 42% of global youth population by 2030, repressive sociocultural policies towards women, poor access to healthcare, malnutrition, rapid urbanization, climate change and pollution. Early life stress, whether physical or psychological, induces neuroinflammatory response in developing nervous system and consequently leads to the emergence of mental health problems during adulthood. Brain inflammatory response is driven largely by inflammatory mediators released by glial cells; namely astrocytes and microglia. These inflammatory mediators alter the developmental trajectory of fetal and neonatal brain and results in long-lasting maladaptive behaviors and cognitive deficits. This review seeks to highlight the patterns and mechanisms of stressors such as poverty, developmental stress, environmental pollutions as well as malnutrition stress on astrocytes and microglia in neuroinflammation within the African context.","D000293; D000328; D001253; D005260; D006801; D007231; D007249; D018836; D044342; D017628; D000090862","Adolescent; Adult; Astrocytes; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Malnutrition; Microglia; Neuroinflammatory Diseases",NA,"10.1126/science.1190928; 10.1038/s41593-020-00783-4; 10.3389/fimmu.2020.01394; 10.3389/fncel.2015.00261; 10.1016/j.it.2016.06.006; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1514-09.2009; 10.1038/nm.3681; 10.1084/jem.20110698; 10.1016/j.neures.2020.11.005; 10.1016/s0165-5728(02)00029-2; 10.1097/nen.0b013e31812571b0; 10.1177/0269881118754680; 10.1016/j.cmet.2011.08.016; 10.1016/j.neuron.2015.03.035; 10.1002/glia.20671; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0756-16.2017; 10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.018; 10.1038/nrn1824; 10.1093/brain/awm047; 10.1002/ana.21837; 10.1002/ana.24630; 10.3390/ijms21249632; 10.1186/1742-2094-9-280; 10.1016/j.neuron.2018.03.010; 10.1038/nature25752; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0723-07.2007; 10.1016/j.it.2007.01.005; 10.2174/157339510791823655; 10.1084/jem.20202715; 10.4110/in.2018; 10.1084/jem.20041918; 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06190.x; 10.1016/j.bbi.2010.09.015; 10.1093/brain/awq359; 10.1128/JVI.03307-12; 10.1111/apm.12740; 10.1186/1742-2094-11-10; 10.1186/1742-2094-11-105; 10.1016/S0165-5728(98)91399-6; 10.1038/nm.3868; 10.1371/journal.pone.0042088; 10.1186/s12974-020-01861-x; 10.1002/glia.22675; 10.18632/oncotarget.6914; 10.1002/eji.201242679; 10.1093/brain/awh680; 10.1084/jem.20041674; 10.1186/s12974-018-1136-2; 10.1016/j.immuni.2015.03.011; 10.1002/cne.21123; 10.1111/j.1469-7580.2010.01245.x; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1619-13.2014; 10.1113/JP272134; 10.15252/embj.201696056; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3441-12.2013; 10.1177/1535370216664430; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1268-12.2013; 10.1371/journal.pone.0081218; 10.1016/j.cell.2013.11.030; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1167-12.2012; 10.1038/ncomms12540; 10.3389/fncel.2018.00488; 10.1038/nrn3722; 10.1038/s41582-019-0184-2; 10.1016/j.expneurol.2015.08.018; 10.1186/1742-2094-11-98; 10.1016/j.tins.2009.08.002; 10.1038/nri2748; 10.1155/2013/208093; 10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.018; 10.1016/j.immuni.2017.06.006; 10.1038/s41586-018-0119-x; 10.1126/science.aal3589; 10.1016/j.cell.2019.08.053; 10.1038/s41577-019-0125-8; 10.1038/s41586-020-1999-0; 10.1016/j.neuron.2020.08.012; 10.1146/annurev-immunol-093019-110159; 10.1523/jneurosci.6221-11.2012; 10.1038/s41586-021-03960-y; 10.1212/NXI.0000000000001043; 10.1212/NXI.0000000000000933; 10.1073/pnas.1120611109; 10.1016/j.celrep.2016.09.082; 10.1126/scisignal.aad0612; 10.1073/pnas.2016451117; 10.1038/s41423-020-00585-5; 10.1212/nxi.0000000000000946; 10.1124/pr.113.007823; 10.1016/j.immuni.2017.12.012; 10.1016/j.coi.2021.02.003; 10.1016/j.cell.2018.12.012; 10.1016/j.immuni.2019.04.006; 10.1038/nri2356; 10.1084/jem.194.7.873; 10.1016/j.cell.2019.11.016; 10.1007/BF02740665; 10.1038/75068; 10.1186/s12974-015-0293-9; 10.1038/ni.3632; 10.1126/science.abf1230; 10.1038/s41590-020-0654-0; 10.1084/jem.20102049; 10.1126/science.aal3535; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0481-10.2010; 10.1172/jci92300; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.05.028; 10.1001/archpsyc.61.8.774; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2014.13121579; 10.1038/mp.2012.197; 10.1016/j.bbi.2016.06.005; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.11.024; 10.1126/science.1202529; 10.1016/j.bbr.2016.09.006; 10.1523/ENEURO.0297-16.2016; 10.1016/j.neuron.2014.02.040; 10.1113/jphysiol.2005.102939; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.07.011; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6078-09.2010; 10.1016/s0959-4388(02)00299-4; 10.1038/sj.mp.4001748; 10.1016/j.bbi.2010.03.005; 10.3389/fncel.2016.00173; 10.1038/pr.2015.86; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2178-07.2007; 10.1016/j.bbi.2013.05.007; 10.1186/1742-2094-9-71; 10.1016/j.bbi.2012.11.013; 10.1007/s00401-009-0590-4; 10.3389/fnsyn.2017.00010; 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00698; 10.3389/fimmu.2019.00625; 10.1186/2049-9957-2-26; 10.3389/fimmu.2019.00573; 10.1016/S2214-109X(14)70227-X; 10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30109-1; 10.1179/027249303235002215; 10.1080/02724936.1989.11748629; 10.1111/j.1469-8749.1991.tb05113.x; 10.1002/aur.1766; 10.1186/1752-4458-6-9; 10.1126/science.aay8833; 10.1038/nn.4402; 10.1016/j.neuron.2019.05.002; 10.1017/S0033291719001703; 10.1016/j.pt.2013.03.005; 10.4269/ajtmh.20-1553; 10.1503/cmaj.050342; 10.1186/s12887-015-0496-3; 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)17791-5","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","Matthew Ayokunle Olude, Abdeslam Mouihate, Oluwaseun Ahmed Mustapha, Cinthia Farina, Francisco Javier Quintana, James Olukayode Olopade","Neuroscience Unit, Department of Veterinary Anatomy, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."

These disorders involve underlying disruption of reward circuits and likely vary by sex. Accordingly, we previously found that ELA leads to anhedonia for natural rewards and cocaine in male rodents, whereas in females ELA instead increases vulnerability to addiction-like use of opioid drugs and palatable food. While these findings suggest that ELA-induced disruption of reward circuitry may differ between the sexes, the specific circuit nodes that are influenced by ELA in either sex remain poorly understood. Here, in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, we ask how ELA impacts opioid addiction-relevant behaviors that we previously tested after ELA in females. We probe potential circuit mechanisms in males by assessing opioid-associated neuronal activation in stress and reward circuit nodes including nucleus accumbens (NAc), amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and paraventricular thalamus. We find that ELA diminishes opioid-seeking behaviors in males, and alters heroin-induced activation of NAc, PFC, and amygdala, suggesting a potential circuit-based mechanism. These studies demonstrate that ELA leads to behavioral and neurobiological disruptions consistent with anhedonia in male rodents, unlike the increased opioid seeking we previously saw in females. Our findings, taken together with our prior work, suggest that men and women could face qualitatively different mental health consequences of ELA, which may be essential for individually tailoring future intervention strategies.","D000076783; D000701; D059445; D000818; D005260; D006801; D008297; D051381; D017207; D012201","Adverse Childhood Experiences; Analgesics, Opioid; Anhedonia; Animals; Female; Humans; Male; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Reward","P50 DA044118; DA051137; F30 DA051137; GM008620; MH096889; T32 MH119049; MH119049; P50 MH096889; UL1 TR001414; DA044118","NA","The authors declare no competing interests.","Sophia C Levis, Matthew T Birnie, Jessica L Bolton, Christina R Perrone, Johanna S Montesinos, Tallie Z Baram, Stephen V Mahler","Department of Neurobiology &amp; Behavior, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA."

This study sought to determine whether higher levels of neighborhood poverty would be associated with reduced HV among individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P), and whether social engagement would moderate this association. This cross-sectional study included a sample of participants (N &#x2005;=&#x2005; 174, age-range&#x2005;=&#x2005;12-33 years, 35.1% female) recruited for the second phase of the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study. Generalized linear mixed models tested the association between neighborhood poverty and bilateral HV, as well as the moderating role of social engagement on this association. Higher levels of neighborhood poverty were associated with reduced left (&#x3b2; &#x2005;=&#x2005; -0.180, P &#x2005;=&#x2005; .016) and right HV (&#x3b2; &#x2005;=&#x2005; -0.185, P &#x2005;=&#x2005; .016). Social engagement significantly moderated the relation between neighborhood poverty and bilateral HV.

The risks of drug abuse may not be fully understood by all members of society, partly because of the taboo nature of the subject, and partly because of the considerable gap between scientific production/understanding and communication of such knowledge to the public at large. Drug use is a major challenge to social development and a leading cause of school dropout rates worldwide. Some public policies adopted in several countries in recent decades failed to prevent drug use, especially because they focused on imposing combative or coercive measures, investing little or nothing in education and prevention. Here we highlight the role of neuroscience education as a valid approach in drug use education and prevention. We propose building a bridge between schools and scientists by promoting information, student engagement and honest dialogue, and show evidence that public policy regulators should be persuaded to support such science-based education programs in their efforts to effect important positive changes in society.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1038/sj.npp.1300221; 10.2147/NDT.S39776; 10.33448/rsd-v10i5.15097; 10.1016/s0376-8716(99)00016-2; 10.1542/peds.106.4.792; 10.1590/1983-80422015232070; 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2013.06.00; 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2000.tb04586.x; 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00377; 10.1590/S1413-85572014000100003; 10.1002/14651858.CD008969.pub3; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.0541; 10.1080/09500693.2010.482571; 10.1038/npp.2008.96; 10.1111/chso.12430; 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01111; 10.1080/00219266.2020.1757489; 10.15448/2179-8435.2017.1.24527; 10.1038/sj.npp.1301643; 10.1080/1067828X.2015.1103348; 10.1016/j.bandc.2014.01.006; 10.1002/14651858.CD003020.pub3; 10.1002/14651858.CD003020.pub2; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2009.11.018; 10.1073/pnas.1213273110; 10.2307/2137279; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2007.09.020; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2017.08.037; 10.1151/spp07324; 10.1016/j.tics.2015.07.008; 10.19131/rpesm.0160; 10.1002/14651858.CD012287.pub2; 10.1371/journal.pone.0226732; 10.1073/pnas.0402680101; 10.1016/j.nlm.2013.08.004; 10.2174/1874473711104010004; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2004.08.014; 10.2196/games.9944; 10.1542/peds.2008-2015; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2017.03.009; 10.2190/DE.43.3.d; 10.1016/j.chc.2015.11.007; 10.1016/j.pbb.2020.173010; 10.1111/mbe.12261; 10.1038/scientificamericanmind0114-70; 10.1002/14651858.CD009927.pub2; 10.3389/fcomm.2020.00031; 10.1542/peds.2013-3003; 10.35946/arcr.v40.1.01; 10.1073/pnas.1206820109; 10.1187/cbe.05-08-0115; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.1471; 10.1038/s41386-018-0240-4; 10.3390/ijerph6010267; 10.1503/jpn.180115; 10.1177/0269881108092393; 10.1371/journal.pone.0177252; 10.3389/fsoc.2020.613814; 10.1080/00048674.2010.501759; 10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103413; 10.1016/j.drugpo.2014.07.011; 10.1080/02791072.2019.1707333; 10.1038/nn.3672; 10.11606/issn.1806-6976.v12i1p30-39; 10.1016/j.cpr.2018.02.002; 10.15288/jsad.2012.73.749; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.14101249; 10.1111/dar.12611; 10.1007/0-306-48626-1_9; 10.1007/s00213-011-2479-x; 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01454; 10.2174/1570159X15666171103152136; 10.15547/tjs.2018.02.004; 10.1590/s0104-11692011000200013; 10.1016/j.bandc.2013.09.008; 10.1016/j.brainres.2018.12.002","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","Thereza Cristina Machado do Vale, Luana da Silva Chagas, Helena de Souza Pereira, Elizabeth Giestal-de-Araujo, Anal&#xed;a Ar&#xe9;valo, Priscilla Oliveira-Silva Bomfim","NuPEDEN, Nucleus for Research, Education, Dissemination and Neurosciences Popularization, Department of Neurobiology and Program of Neurosciences, Institute of Biology, Federal Fluminense University, Niter&#xf3;i, Brazil."

Food insecurity in female-identified caregivers is particularly concerning, given its association with their mental health and adverse health outcomes for their children. Food insecurity is associated with disordered eating but, to our knowledge, no prior studies have examined an association between food insecurity and food addiction. Our aim was to examine whether food insecurity is associated with higher food addiction symptom endorsement in low-income female adults. Secondary analysis of baseline data from a quasi-experimental study of a mindfulness-based intervention on gestational weight gain among low-income pregnant individuals and an observational study of low-income families. Participants in study 1 (n&#xa0;= 208) were English-speaking, low-income pregnant individuals with overweight or obesity, recruited in California from 2011 to 2013. Participants in study 2 (n&#xa0;= 181) were English-speaking, low-income female caregivers for children aged 8 through 10 years, recruited in Michigan from 2018 to 2019. Both studies recruited participants from community health clinics, social service agencies, and online advertisements. The primary outcome measure was food addiction symptoms, assessed by the Yale Food Addiction Scale. Multivariate Poisson regression was used to examine the association between household food insecurity and food addiction symptoms in each sample, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. In study 1, pregnant individuals in food-insecure households reported 21% higher food addiction symptoms than pregnant individuals in food-secure households (incidence rate ratio 1.21; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.47; P&#xa0;= .047).

We extracted prevalence data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation global database in 2019. There was a lower prevalence of mental (12.5%) and substance use (1.7%) disorders in highly vulnerable countries than less vulnerable ones (15.1% and 3.5%, respectively).

Yet public healthcare does not include routine detection and treatment for these disorders. This pilot study aims to evaluate the implementation outcomes of a health systems strengthening (HSS) intervention for improving the quality of care of perinatal women with CMD and experiences of domestic violence, attending public healthcare facilities in Cape Town. Three antenatal care facilities were purposively selected for delivery of a HSS programme consisting of four components: (1) health promotion and awareness raising talks delivered by lay healthcare workers; (2) detection of CMD and domestic violence by nurses as part of routine care; (3) referral of women with CMD and domestic violence; and (4) delivery of structured counselling by lay healthcare workers in patients' homes. Participants included healthcare workers tasked with delivery of the HSS components, and perinatal women attending the healthcare facilities for routine antenatal care. This mixed methods study used qualitative interviews with healthcare workers and pregnant women, a patient survey, observation of health promotion and awareness raising talks, and a review of several documents, to evaluate the acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, adoption, fidelity of delivery, and fidelity of receipt of the HSS components. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the qualitative interviews, while the quantitative findings for adoption and fidelity of receipt were reported using numbers and proportions. Healthcare workers found the delivery and content of the HSS components to be both acceptable and appropriate, while the feasibility, adoption and fidelity of delivery was poor. We demonstrated that the health promotion and awareness raising component improved women's attitudes towards seeking help for mental health conditions. The detection, referral and treatment components were found to improve fidelity of receipt, evidenced by an increase in the proportion of women undergoing routine detection and referral, and decreased feelings of distress in women who received counselling. However, using a task-sharing approach did not prove to be feasible, as adding additional responsibilities to already overburdened healthcare workers roles resulted in poor fidelity of delivery and adoption of all the HSS components. The acceptability, appropriateness and fidelity of receipt of the HSS programme components, and poor feasibility, fidelity of delivery and adoption suggest the need to appoint dedicated, lay healthcare workers to deliver key programme components, at healthcare facilities, on the same day.","D017579; D005240; D005260; D006801; D001523; D010865; D011247; D013019","Domestic Violence; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Mental Disorders; Pilot Projects; Pregnancy; South Africa",NA,"10.1017/S204017441700071X; 10.1007/s00127-018-1497-y; 10.1186/1742-4755-8-9; 10.7196/SAMJ.6009; 10.1007/s00737-017-0768-z; 10.2471/BLT.12.109819; 10.1007/s11121-013-0376-8; 10.1007/s10488-010-0319-7; 10.7196/SAMJ.9181; 10.1136/bmjgh-2018-000962; 10.1186/s12913-016-1904-6; 10.1186/1471-2288-13-117; 10.1186/s13033-021-00443-5; 10.4103/0970-0218.94009; 10.3402/gha.v7.24085; 10.1186/1478-4491-7-15; 10.4102/curationis.v39i1.1545; 10.1016/j.midw.2017.12.020; 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032816-045217; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.08.004; 10.1007/s10597-020-00734-0; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.07.057","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Zulfa Abrahams, Yuche Jacobs, Mbali Mohlamonyane, Sonet Boisits, Marguerite Schneider, Simone Honikman, Nadine Seward, Crick Lund","Alan J Flisher Centre for Public Mental Health, Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, University of Cape Town, Building B, 46 Sawkins Road, Rondebosch, Cape Town, 7700, South Africa."

Given limited tools for assessing these effects early in life, the authors explore how enhanced capacity to measure stress activation directly in young children could transform the role and scope of pediatric practice. When employed within a trusted relationship between caregivers and clinicians, selective use of biological measures of stress responses would help address the documented limitations of rating scales of adverse childhood experiences as a primary indicator of individual risk and strengthen the ability to focus on variation in intervention needs, assess their effectiveness, and guide ongoing management. The authors provide an overview of the potential benefits and risks of such expanded measurement capacity, as well as an introduction to candidate indicators that might be employed in an office setting. The ultimate value of such measures for both pediatricians and parents will require vigilant attention to the ethical responsibilities of assuring their correct interpretation and minimizing the harm of inappropriate labeling, especially for children and families experiencing the hardships and threats of racism, poverty, and other structural inequities. Whereas much work remains to be done to advance measurement development and ensure its equitable use, the potential of validated markers of stress activation and resilience to strengthen the impact of primary health care on the lives of young children facing significant adversity demands increased attention.","D000076783; D001695; D017028; D002648; D000067576; D002669; D002675; D006801","Adverse Childhood Experiences; Biology; Caregivers; Child; Child Health; Child Welfare; Child, Preschool; Humans",NA,"NA",NA,"Jack P Shonkoff, W Thomas Boyce, Nicole R Bush, Megan R Gunnar, Takao K Hensch, Pat Levitt, Michael J Meaney, Charles A Nelson, Natalie Slopen,  ..., Patricia Pelufo Silveira","Ludmer Centre for Neuroinformatics and Mental Health, Douglas Hospital Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."

Perinatal CMDs have been associated with several adverse maternal and child outcomes. While the Department of Health in South Africa provides healthcare workers with the tools to detect psychological distress and experiences of domestic violence, few healthcare workers routinely screen pregnant women at clinic visits, citing discomfort with mental health issues and the lack of standardised referral pathways as the key barriers.

This study consists of a pre-implementation, development, and implementation phase. Contextual barriers identified during the pre-implementation phase included poor patient knowledge and health-seeking behaviour, high levels of stigma, and poor detection, referral, and treatment rates. Implementation science determinant frameworks were applied to findings from the pre-implementation phase to identify determinants and gaps in delivering high-quality evidence-informed care. A participatory Theory of Change workshop was used to design a HSS programme, consisting of awareness raising, detection, referral, and treatment. HSS interventions selected to support the delivery of the HSS programme includes training, health promotion, change to the healthcare environment, task-sharing, audit and feedback, and performance monitoring. The implementation phase will be used to assess several implementation and clinical outcomes associated with the delivery of the HSS programme, which will be piloted at three healthcare facilities. Qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to evaluate the implementation and clinical outcomes. This pilot implementation study will inform us about a range of implementation and clinical outcome measures that are relevant for assessing HSS interventions for perinatal women with depression, anxiety, or experiences of domestic violence in low-resource settings.

Across all papers is the clear theme of needing to shift from where we have been in order to establish a path forward for where we need to go to account for learners that have been relatively neglected in scientific studies. To break down barriers of inequity and increase our understanding of causes and consequences of vulnerable learners, there is a need to re-think how we establish policies and allocate funds, as well as broadening our lens as we conduct scientific studies.

Sixty-two studies with a total of 231 512 participants were included. Eighty-five lifetime prevalence estimates and 6 estimates of past-year prevalence were available for synthesis. The average lifetime prevalence of childhood exposure to IPV was 29% (95% CI 26% to 31%). The average past-year prevalence in children was 35% (95% CI 21% to 48%). The lifetime prevalence disaggregated by WHO regions ranged from 21% to 34%. There were no statistical differences in prevalence estimates between samples of men and women. Almost one-third of children in low-income and lower-middle-income countries have been exposed to IPV in their lifetime.

These result in subtle deviations in brain structure and cognitive function. Striatal dopamine dysregulation follows, causing abnormal salience and resultant psychotic symptoms. Most people diagnosed as having schizophrenia do not progressively deteriorate; many improve or recover. However, poor care can allow a cycle of deterioration to be established, stress increasing dopamine dysregulation, leading to more stress consequent on continuing psychotic experiences, and so further dopamine release. Additionally, long-term antipsychotics can induce dopamine supersensitivity with resultant relapse and eventually treatment resistance. Some patients suffer loss of social and cognitive function, but this is a consequence of the hazards that afflict the person with schizophrenia, not a direct consequence of genetic predisposition. Thus, brain health and cognition can be further impaired by chronic medication effects, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, obesity, poor diet, and lack of exercise; drug use, especially of tobacco and cannabis, are likely to contribute. Poverty, homelessness and poor nutrition which become the lot of some people with schizophrenia, can also affect cognition.

Although there are many benefits to living in an urban environment, urbanicity has also been associated with deleterious health outcomes, including increased risk for psychotic outcomes particularly when the urban exposure occurs in pre-adolescence. However, the mechanisms underlying this association is unclear. Here, we utilize one-year follow-up data from a large (<i>N</i>=7,979), nationwide study of pre-adolescence in the United States to clarify why urbanicity (i.e., census-tract population density) might impact psychotic-like experiences (PLE) by looking at the indirect effect of eight candidate urbanicity-related physical (e.g., pollution) and social (e.g., poverty) exposures. Consistent with other work, we found that of the evaluated exposures related to urbanicity, several were also related to increased number of PLE: PM<sub>2.5</sub>, proximity to roads, census-level homes at-risk for exposure to lead paint, census-level poverty, and census-level income-disparity. These same urban-related exposures were also related to the persistence of PLE after 1 year, but not new onset of PLE. Mediation analysis revealed that a substantial proportion the urbanicity-PLE association (number and persistence) could be explained by PM<sub>2.5</sub> (23-44%), families in poverty (68-93%), and income disparity (67-80%). Together, these findings suggest that specific urban-related exposures contribute to the existence and maintenance, but not onset of PLE, which might help to explain why those in urban environments are disproportionately at-risk for psychosis and point toward areas for public health intervention.",NA,NA,NA,"10.4314/as.v17i3.6; 10.1126/science.1150198; 10.1093/ije/dym271; 10.1192/bjp.179.4.335; 10.1016/0140-6736(92)93213-7; 10.1017/S0033291799008983; 10.1017/S0033291798006898; 10.1056/NEJM199902253400803; 10.1093/schbul/sbw052; 10.1192/bjp.184.4.293; 10.1001/archpsyc.58.7.663; 10.1001/archpsyc.63.3.250; 10.1001/archpsyc.58.11.1039; 10.1017/S0033291718000235; 10.1016/j.schres.2009.10.015; 10.1093/schbul/sbi060; 10.1093/schbul/sbs096; 10.1016/j.schres.2008.01.022; 10.1111/eip.12861; 10.1093/epirev/mxn006; 10.1016/j.schres.2015.08.028; 10.1192/bjp.184.4.287; 10.1038/nature09563; 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2010.09.003; 10.1017/S0033291720000355; 10.1016/S2542-5196(20)30004-8; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2017.02.492; 10.4137/EHI.S15664; 10.1016/j.envpol.2018.09.142; 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.09.066; 10.1289/ehp.10464; 10.1289/ehp.6777; 10.1017/S0033291708004534; 10.1017/S0033291716002993; 10.1093/schbul/sbs112; 10.1093/schbul/sbl053; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00634.x; 10.1017/S0033291713000718; 10.1371/journal.pone.0031660; 10.1093/schbul/sbt134; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.0056; 10.1016/S0920-9964(03)00062-8; 10.1093/schbul/sbx060; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.3155; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.14; 10.1017/S0033291705006902; 10.1016/j.dcn.2018.04.004; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.1334; 10.1093/schizbullopen/sgaa009; 10.1016/j.dcn.2017.10.010; 10.1016/j.dcn.2018.03.004; 10.1016/j.jaac.2020.07.003; 10.2105/AJPH.93.7.1137; 10.1016/j.schres.2011.03.029; 10.1016/j.schres.2020.05.045; 10.1101/2021.01.15.21249864; 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.218; 10.1007/s00420-018-1311-x; 10.1016/j.envres.2018.12.019; 10.1192/bjp.184.2.110; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.08.001; 10.1002/wps.20341; 10.1177/0020764013481426; 10.1007/s00127-015-1112-4; 10.1093/schbul/sbs151; 10.1017/S204579601500044X; 10.18637/jss.v067.i01; 10.18637/jss.v048.i02; 10.1207/s15327906mbr3901_4; 10.1080/19312458.2012.679848; 10.2307/2094445; 10.1016/j.schres.2016.10.003; 10.1016/j.tins.2009.05.009; 10.1177/0192623307313011; 10.1155/2012/782462; 10.1093/schbul/sbt085; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.05.023; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.03.013; 10.1016/j.psychres.2013.12.014; 10.1192/bjp.186.5.427; 10.1192/bjp.187.5.401; 10.1017/S0033291714002682; 10.1177/070674371305800107; 10.1093/schbul/sbq120; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.0142; 10.1007/s00127-017-1370-4; 10.1017/S0033291719000485; 10.1007/BF00789219; 10.2307/2095519; 10.1016/j.envint.2021.106905; 10.1289/ehp.1409430","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","Abhishek Saxena, David Dodell-Feder","Department of Psychology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, United States."

Only articles published in English in peer-reviewed journals were considered. Two authors independently assessed eligibility of the articles. One author extracted data [e.g. number of cases and non-cases in each parental education level, effect sizes in forms of odds ratios (ORs) or beta coefficients]. We then calculated pooled ORs using a random-effects model and used moderator analysis to investigate heterogeneity. We included a total of 59 articles (63 study samples, totalling 2 738 374 subjects) in the meta-analysis. Lower parental education was associated with youth suicidal attempts [OR = 1.12, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.04-1.21] but not with suicidal ideation (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.98-1.12). Geographical region and country income level moderated the associations. Lower parental education was associated with an increased risk of youth suicidal attempts in Northern America (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.10-1.45), but with a decreased risk in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.54-0.96). An association of lower parental education and increased risk of youth suicidal ideation was present in high- income countries (HICs) (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.05-1.25), and absent in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.77-1.08). The association between youth suicidal behaviours and parental education seems to differ across geographical and economical contexts, suggesting that cultural, psychosocial or biological factors may play a role in explaining this association. Although there was high heterogeneity in the studies reviewed, this evidence suggests that the role of familial sociodemographic characteristics in youth suicidality may not be universal. This highlights the need to consider cultural, as well as familial factors in the clinical assessment and management of youth's suicidal behaviours in our increasingly multicultural societies, as well as in developing prevention and intervention strategies for youth suicide.","D000293; D002648; D002675; D004522; D006801; D007223; D007231; D010290; D011203; D059020; D013405","Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Educational Status; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Parents; Poverty; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide","MR/S003444/1","NA","The funders had no role in the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis and interpretation of the data; preparation, review or approval of the manuscript and decision to submit the manuscript for publication.","P J Chen, N Mackes, C Sacchi, A J Lawrence, X Ma, R Pollard, M Matter, C Morgan, S Harding,  ..., P Dazzan","Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."

They support patients and their families through difficult times and improve patient lives. To study the profile of patients availed psychiatric social work services in neurology casualty and emergency settings. The study was retrospective in nature. The ex-post facto research design was used in the study. Data were obtained from a casualty &amp; emergency psychiatric social work referral registry maintained by the psychiatric social work team at the Neurology emergency setting at NIMHANS, Bangalore. Patients referred for psychiatric social work interventions from April 2020 to March 2021 were considered for the study purpose. Frequency and percentages were used to describe the data. Psychiatric social work services at the neurology emergency setting were started in July 2018. Social workers get referrals from triage (four hours to 24 hours), followed by priority ward (72 hours to two weeks), observation ward (72 hours days - two weeks) and emergency ICU. There are 100 beds available for neuro-emergency settings. Of &#x2248;15,939 patients who availed the neurology emergency services, 159 patients were referred for psychiatric social work services. A majority (61.6%) received neuro-education about their illness; awareness about their illness were given to patients and their family members. More than half of them were given guidance for availing treatment welfare benefits under below poverty line and Ayushman Bharath Scheme (54%), 43.3% received supportive psychotherapy, 35.2% pre-discharge counselling, one-third received crisis intervention,12.6% family interventions, 10.7% were facilitated for hospital charges waiver off, few unknown patients management and tracing their family members. Most patients were diagnosed with a stroke, GBS, neuro-infections, and seizure disorder patients who sought psychiatric social work services in emergency and casualty settings. Assessment of their functionality revealed that most were partially independent and dependent. Social workers work from 9 am to 9 pm in the neuro-emergency setting. Immediate social work referrals were made for unknown patients, tracing the caregivers who left the emergency ward without permission, which required financial assistance and communicating poor prognosis (breaking the bad news).

The study of how circuits generate and maintain functional dynamics is hindered by a poverty of description of circuit dynamics across functional and dysfunctional states. For example, although the regular oscillation of a central pattern generator is well characterized by its frequency and the phase relationships between its neurons, these metrics are ineffective descriptors of the irregular and aperiodic dynamics that circuits can generate under perturbation or in disease states. By recording the circuit dynamics of the well-studied pyloric circuit in <i>Cancer borealis</i>, we used statistical features of spike times from neurons in the circuit to visualize the spike patterns generated by this circuit under a variety of conditions. This approach captures both the variability of functional rhythms and the diversity of atypical dynamics in a single map. Clusters in the map identify qualitatively different spike patterns hinting at different dynamic states in the circuit. State probability and the statistics of the transitions between states varied with environmental perturbations, removal of descending neuromodulatory inputs, and the addition of exogenous neuromodulators. This analysis reveals strong mechanistically interpretable links between complex changes in the collective behavior of a neural circuit and specific experimental manipulations, and can constrain hypotheses of how circuits generate functional dynamics despite variability in circuit architecture and environmental perturbations.","D000818; D003386; D017952; D009474; D018377; D011708","Animals; Brachyura; Ganglia, Invertebrate; Neurons; Neurotransmitter Agents; Pylorus","R01 MH060605; R35 NS097343; T32 NS007292","10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15191.1; 10.7554/eLife.42722; 10.7554/eLife.55470; 10.1242/jeb.109.1.35; 10.1098/rsif.2014.0672; 10.1002/aris.1440370106; 10.1152/jn.01095.2002; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3679-04.2005; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0280-14.2014; 10.1038/s41587-020-00748-9; 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2006.02.023; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0062-04.2004; 10.1016/s0034-5687(01)00308-5; 10.1016/j.cub.2021.09.030; 10.1007/978-3-540-33037-0_14; 10.1038/nn.3776; 10.1016/j.conb.2016.07.005; 10.1152/jn.2001.85.4.1424; 10.1162/neco_a_01097; 10.1152/jn.1982.48.6.1392; 10.1152/jn.1984.51.6.1375; 10.1007/BF00202450; 10.1109/LCSYS.2020.2997214; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0171-15.2015; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.12-03-00810.1992; 10.1162/089976699300016359; 10.1152/jn.00412.2001; 10.7554/eLife.56261; 10.1038/s41598-020-72977-6; 10.3791/1207; 10.1016/j.neuron.2013.01.016; 10.1016/j.neuron.2018.08.035; 10.7554/eLife.41877; 10.1101/sqb.2014.79.024828; 10.1523/ENEURO.0058-14.2015; 10.1146/annurev.ne.14.030191.000351; 10.1242/jeb.62.2.405; 10.1152/jn.00135.2020; 10.1016/0006-8993(84)91138-7; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.07-07-02097.1987; 10.1152/jn.01010.2014; 10.1038/s41467-019-13056-x; 10.1038/s41587-020-00809-z; 10.1038/s41586-019-1892-x; 10.1242/jeb.199190; 10.7554/eLife.56879; 10.1038/s41592-018-0308-4; 10.1137/18m1216134; 10.7554/eLife.38471; 10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.002; 10.1038/415213a; 10.1007/978-1-4757-5858-0_17; 10.1002/cne.902430403; 10.1016/B978-0-08-041986-2.50006-0; 10.1146/annurev.physiol.69.031905.161516; 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.09.010; 10.1038/nn1391; 10.21105/joss.00861; 10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.188101; 10.1152/jn.1982.48.6.1416; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.21-18-07331.2001; 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006907; 10.1242/jeb.135.1.165; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.09-05-01591.1989; 10.1016/j.neuron.2014.04.002; 10.1101/061507; 10.1016/j.cub.2016.05.029; 10.1093/mnras/202.3.615; 10.7554/eLife.60454; 10.1152/jn.00641.2003; 10.1038/nn1352; 10.1242/jeb.02709; 10.1016/j.bpj.2021.01.038; 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002857; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2632-17.2018; 10.1016/0006-8993(76)90482-0; 10.1016/S0925-2312(02)00838-X; 10.1038/nn1639; 10.1073/pnas.0705827104; 10.1109/INFVIS.2001.963283; 10.1152/jn.00986.2007; 10.1038/nn.3947; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.20-18-06752.2000; 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000469; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1443-12.2012; 10.1152/jn.00764.2005; 10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.224101; 10.1371/journal.pone.0006742; 10.1152/jn.1993.69.6.1993; 10.1126/science.8178157; 10.1162/089976601300014321; 10.1126/science.274.5293.1724; 10.1088/0954-898X_8_2_003; 10.1146/annurev-neuro-092619-094115; 10.23915/distill.00002; 10.1016/j.neuron.2018.05.015","SG, EC, AS, SH, PR, DB, FN, EM No competing interests declared","Srinivas Gorur-Shandilya, Elizabeth M Cronin, Anna C Schneider, Sara Ann Haddad, Philipp Rosenbaum, Dirk Bucher, Farzan Nadim, Eve Marder","Volen Center and Biology Department, Brandeis University, Waltham, United States."

Seizure frequency, prescribed drug dose, and adverse reactions were monitored monthly by door-to-door survey or telephone interview. A total of 1,333 women were included in the study. During the follow-up period, 169 participants (12.7%) were lost to follow-up, and 100 of them (7.5%) died.

We explored what, at a neural level, helps explain children's resilience in these contexts. Lower coupling between lateral frontoparietal network (LFPN) and default mode network (DMN)-linked, respectively, to externally- and internally-directed thought-has previously been associated with better cognitive performance. However, we recently found the opposite pattern for children in poverty. Here, we probed ecologically-valid assessments of performance. In a pre-registered study, we investigated trajectories of network coupling over ages 9-13 and their relation to school grades and attention problems. We analyzed longitudinal data from ABCD Study (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;8366 children at baseline; 1303 below poverty). The link between cognitive performance and grades was weaker for children in poverty, highlighting the importance of ecologically-valid measures. As predicted, higher LFPN-DMN connectivity was linked to worse grades and attentional problems for children living above poverty, while children below poverty showed opposite tendencies. This interaction between LFPN-DMN connectivity and poverty related to children's grades two years later; however, it was attenuated when controlling for baseline grades and was not related to attention longitudinally. Together, these findings suggest network connectivity is differentially related to performance in real-world settings for children above and below poverty.","D000293; D001288; D001921; D001931; D002648; D006801; D008279; D009434; D011203","Adolescent; Attention; Brain; Brain Mapping; Child; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Pathways; Poverty","U01 DA041048; U01 DA050989; U01 DA051016; U01 DA041022; U01 DA051018; U01 DA051037; U01 DA050987; U01 DA041174; U01 DA041106; U01 DA041117; U01 DA041028; U01 DA041134; U01 DA050988; U01 DA051039; U01 DA041156; U01 DA041025; U01 DA041120; U01 DA051038; U01 DA041148; U01 DA041093; U01 DA041089; U24 DA041123; U24 DA041147","10.1542/pir.21-8-265; 10.1080/10400419.2018.1411423; 10.1016/j.dcn.2017.10.010; 10.18637/jss.v067.i01; 10.1016/j.tics.2015.10.004; 10.1016/j.bandc.2016.12.004; 10.1038/s41583-019-0212-7; 10.1016/j.cobeha.2015.11.018; 10.1016/j.dcn.2018.03.001; 10.1371/journal.pone.0190073; 10.1162/jocn_a_00517; 10.1073/pnas.0900234106; 10.1038/nrn2005; 10.1111/cdev.13504; 10.1002/cne.901230110; 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2014.05.024; 10.1073/pnas.1803276115; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.08.025; 10.1038/s41467-021-27336-y; 10.1111/desc.12450; 10.1073/pnas.1204185109; 10.1002/hbm.460030303; 10.1016/j.dcn.2018.04.004; 10.1093/cercor/bhu239; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.01.079; 10.1177/1073858414524442; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116091; 10.1136/adc.2004.059006; 10.1038/s41598-017-15795-7; 10.1038/npp.2014.165; 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00134; 10.1038/s41467-021-22027-0; 10.1016/j.dcn.2019.100641; 10.1073/pnas.0807041106; 10.1093/cercor/bhz255; 10.1016/j.dcn.2018.02.006; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4141-12.2013; 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002328; 10.1073/pnas.2105304118; 10.1016/S0018-506X(02)00024-7; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.10.012; 10.1111/cdep.12305; 10.1002/icd.2286; 10.1101/2021.07.07.451458; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.08.048; 10.1016/j.neuron.2014.09.007; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.10.044; 10.1073/pnas.98.2.676; 10.1016/j.bpsc.2021.03.008; 10.1016/j.dcn.2021.101005; 10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043152; 10.1073/pnas.1902932116; 10.1007/s00426-014-0617-x; 10.1371/journal.pone.0035744; 10.1016/j.dcn.2014.08.002; 10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00145; 10.1177/1745691619827511; 10.1073/pnas.0800005105; 10.1038/s41583-021-00457-5; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4465-11.2011; 10.1152/jn.90355.2008; 10.31234/osf.io/8nhej; 10.1038/nn1727; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.4208; 10.1146/annurev-economics-080218-025852",NA,"M E Ellwood-Lowe, C N Irving, S A Bunge","Department of Psychology, University of California, Berkeley, USA; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley, USA."

Prehospital systems tend to be underdeveloped or non-existent in these areas, with less than 1% of low-income and middle-income country (LMIC) populations served by an organised prehospital system. Mobile health apps for activation of Emergency Medical System (EMS) have been shown to decrease mortality, but there has yet to be a systematic review and meta-analysis performed to clarify the role that these apps play in reducing mortality in LMICs. The objective of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of mobile health apps for EMS activation versus traditional EMS dispatches in survival and transport time in patients with emergency medical conditions. The proposed systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised controlled trials (NRCTs) will be conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews of effectiveness evidence. MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and EBSCO will be searched from January 2005 to March 2021. The search results will be presented according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram. Primary outcomes will include mortality and transport time. Critical appraisal will be assessed using the JBI SUMARI Risk-of-Bias Tool for RCTs, and Risk-of-Bias In Non-Randomised Studies tool for NRCTs. A narrative synthesis will be conducted for all included studies. If sufficient data are available, a meta-analysis will be conducted. I<sup>2</sup> statistics will be used to assess heterogeneity and identify their potential sources. No ethical approval will be required, as this review is based on already published data and does not involve interaction with human subjects. The plan for dissemination, however, is to publish the findings of the review in a peer-reviewed journal and present findings at high-level international conferences that engage the most pertinent stakeholders.

The present study examines how NLE and associated urban features (e.g., air pollution, low green space) impact mental and physical wellbeing. We included 200,393 UK Biobank Cohort participants with complete data. The study was carried out in two steps. In Step1, we assessed the relationship between NLE, deprivation, pollution, green space, household poverty and mental and physical symptoms. In Step2, we examined the role of NLE on environment-symptom networks. We stratified participants into high and low NLE and used gaussian graphical model to identify nodes which bridged urban features and mental and physical health problems. We then compared the global strength of these networks in high vs low NLE. We found that higher NLE associated with higher air pollution, less green space, higher economic and neighborhood deprivation, higher household poverty and higher depressed mood, higher tiredness/lethargy and obesity (R<sub>training_mean</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.2624, <i>P</i> <sub>training_mean</sub>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001; R<sub>test_mean</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.2619, <i>P</i> <sub>test_mean</sub>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). We also found that the interaction between environmental risk factors and mental, physical problems (overall network connectivity) was higher in the high NLE network than in the low NLE network (t&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.7896, <i>P</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). In areas with high NLE, economic deprivation, household poverty and waist circumference acted as bridge factors between the key urban features and mental health symptoms. In conclusion, NLE, urban features, household poverty and mental and physical symptoms are all interrelated. In areas with high NLE, urban features associate with mental and physical health problems at a greater magnitude than in areas with low NLE.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of the work documenting this association has been conducted in high-income countries. It is not yet known whether the mechanisms found to mediate this association would generalize to children in low- and middle-income countries, where the risks of exposure to extreme poverty and a wide range of both biological and psychosocial hazards may be greater. We examined relations among early adversity, neural correlates of inhibitory control, and cognitive outcomes in 154 5-year-old children living in Dhaka, Bangladesh, an area with a high prevalence of poverty. Participants completed a go/no-go task assessing inhibitory control and their behavioral and event-related potential responses were assessed. Cortical source analysis was performed. We collected measures of poverty, malnutrition, maternal mental health, psychosocial adversity, and cognitive skills. Supporting studies in high-income countries, children in this sample exhibited a longer N2 latency and higher P3 amplitude to the no-go versus go condition. Unexpectedly, children had a more pronounced N2 amplitude during go trials than no-go trials. The N2 latency was related to their behavioral accuracy on the go/no-go task. The P3 mean amplitude, behavioral accuracy, and reaction time during the task were all associated with intelligence-quotient (IQ) scores. Children who experienced higher levels of psychosocial adversity had lower accuracy on the task and lower IQ scores.","D001459; D002675; D003071; D004569; D005071; D006801; D007266; D011930","Bangladesh; Child, Preschool; Cognition; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Humans; Inhibition, Psychological; Reaction Time","K99 HD102566; P50 HD105351; R01 AI043596; R01 HD018942","10.1037/edu0000296; 10.3389/fnut.2017.00017; 10.1016/j.cogbrainres.2004.08.011; 10.1097/YCO.0b013e32833ad79b; 10.1038/s41390-019-0431-7; 10.3945/an.115.010348; 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31389-7; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01019.x; 10.1016/S1388-2457(01)00691-5; 10.1017/S0954579420001819; 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00080; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.05.045; 10.1016/j.cogdev.2007.08.002; 10.2307/2136404; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116602; 10.1017/S0954579415000139; 10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143750; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006363; 10.1111/dmcn.13395; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.03.005; 10.1111/psyp.13336; 10.1080/02646830701644896; 10.1037/dev0000389; 10.1111/cdev.12543; 10.1111/desc.12246; 10.1007/s10567-019-00278-0; 10.1080/87565641.2016.1247162; 10.1111/jcpp.12014; 10.3945/an.115.010363; 10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.001; 10.1002/hbm.20933; 10.1038/s41598-019-39242-x; 10.1016/j.dcn.2021.100981; 10.1016/j.dcn.2019.100677; 10.1016/j.brainres.2006.04.064; 10.1353/cpr.2013.0046; 10.1038/s41598-020-66781-5; 10.1111/mcn.12229; 10.1037/dev0000896; 10.1111/desc.12455; 10.1007/s10826-017-0887-1; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2012.02602.x; 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00213; 10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002314; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104485; 10.1111/mbe.12134; 10.1037/a0038924; 10.1016/j.dcn.2011.09.008; 10.1111/cdev.13095; 10.1016/j.tins.2020.01.002; 10.1111/desc.12795; 10.1093/ajcn/nqy303; 10.1155/2011/156869; 10.1098/rsta.2011.0081; 10.1111/nure.12102; 10.1093/jn/nxaa088; 10.1080/87565641.2017.1355917; 10.1037/a0028343; 10.1016/j.appdev.2008.12.012; 10.1017/S1355617710001335; 10.1002/dev.21742; 10.1016/j.dcn.2017.03.007; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116540; 10.1111/desc.12917; 10.1073/pnas.1809145116; 10.1111/desc.12822; 10.1111/desc.12758; 10.1111/psyp.12670; 10.1007/s10548-016-0505-3; 10.1007/s00429-017-1443-x","The authors declare no conflicts of interest.","Eileen F Sullivan, Wanze Xie, Stefania Conte, John E Richards, Talat Shama, Rashidul Haque, William A Petri, Charles A Nelson","Labs of Cognitive Neuroscience, Division of Developmental Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, USA."

One challenge of studying reward processing in the field of developmental neuroscience is finding a task that activates reward circuitry, and is short, not too complex, and engaging for youth of a wide variety of ages and socioeconomic backgrounds. In the present study, we tested a brief child-friendly reward task for activating reward circuitry in two independent samples of youth ages 7-19 years old enriched for poverty (study 1: n = 464; study 2: n = 27). The reward task robustly activated the ventral striatum, with activation decreasing from early to mid-adolescence and increasing from mid- to late adolescence in response to reward. This response did not vary by gender, pubertal development, or income-to-needs ratio, making the task applicable for a wide variety of populations. Additionally, ventral striatum activation to the task did not differ between youth who did and did not expect to receive a prize at the end of the task, indicating that an outcome of points alone may be enough to engage reward circuitry. Thus, this reward task is effective for studying reward processing in youth from different socioeconomic backgrounds.","D000293; D000367; D001921; D001931; D002648; D005260; D005581; D006801; D008279; D008297; D009042; D009488; D011203; D012201; D012923; D066328; D055815","Adolescent; Age Factors; Brain; Brain Mapping; Child; Female; Foster Home Care; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Motivation; Neurosciences; Poverty; Reward; Social Class; Ventral Striatum; Young Adult","T32 HD007109; UH2 HD087979; RC1 DK086376; R01 DK098983; S10 OD012240; UG3 MH114249; R01 HD093334; R01 HD061356; R21 DK090718","10.3389/neuro.09.006.2010; 10.1111/jcpp.12502; 10.1097/WNR.0b013e3281532bd7; 10.1111/cdev.13056; 10.1006/nimg.2000.0593; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.03.004; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.21-16-j0002.2001; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3446-06.2006; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.03.014; 10.1093/scan/nsv124; 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.02.007; 10.1073/pnas.1310134110; 10.1017/S0140525X0999152X; 10.1007/s40167-014-0024-6; 10.1177/0013124516644053; 10.1177/1088868316644094; 10.2174/1874440000903010058; 10.1111/jora.12408; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1834-17.2017; 10.1002/hbm.24370; 10.1097/00004583-201002000-00010; 10.1016/j.dcn.2011.06.003; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.12.016; 10.1002/hbm.24184; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.07.083; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2431-05.2005; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.03.023; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.07.030; 10.1017/thg.2012.87; 10.1017/thg.2019.57; 10.1375/183242706779462868; 10.1016/j.appet.2013.10.016; 10.1016/j.dcn.2018.03.001; 10.1109/42.906424; 10.1016/s1053-8119(03)00169-1; 10.1006/cbmr.1996.0014; 10.1111/j.1469-8986.2007.00594.x; 10.1007/BF01537962; 10.1002/mrm.1910330508; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116189; 10.1016/j.dcn.2012.08.004; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117872; 10.1177/0956797620916786; 10.1101/2021.10.08.463750v1; 10.1101/2021.10.08.463750; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.01.129; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1062-06.2006; 10.1016/j.dcn.2014.01.005; 10.1073/pnas.1316911111; 10.1016/j.bbr.2015.04.008; 10.1093/scan/nsn051; 10.1093/scan/nsaa157; 10.1016/j.brainres.2006.06.072; 10.2307/1130220; 10.1037/0012-1649.26.2.322; 10.1038/s41593-021-00867-9","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Melissa K Peckins, Heidi B Westerman, S Alexandra Burt, Laura Murray, Martha Alves, Alison L Miller, Ashley N Gearhardt, Kelly L Klump, Julie C Lumeng, Luke W Hyde","Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America."

Five studies reported cumulative incidence of postpartum psychosis (ranging from 1.1 to 16.7 per 1000 births). We found no studies on the prevalence of severe mental disorder during pregnancy in these settings. Marked heterogeneity in methodology precluded meta-analysis. These findings indicate that PSMDs occur at a similar prevalence in low- and middle-income to high-income countries. However overall, there is a paucity of high-quality evidence from these settings.

Participants from three age groups (20-25, 40-45, 60-65) retrospectively reported their childhood experiences of domestic adversity on a 17-item scale (e.g., physical abuse, verbal abuse, neglect, poverty). We compared three approaches to operationalising the 17-item scale: a cumulative risk approach, factor analysis, and latent class analysis (LCA). The cumulative risk and dimensional models were represented by a unidimensional and two-dimensional model respectively using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The cumulative risk approach and LCA were viable approaches to operationalising ACE data in PATH. CFA of the dimensional model produced latent factors of threat and deprivation that were highly correlated, potentially leading to problems with multicollinearity when estimating associations. LCA revealed six classes of ACEs: high adversity, low adversity, low affection, authoritarian upbringing, high parental dysfunction, and moderate parental dysfunction. Our study found multiple latent classes within a 17-item questionnaire assessing domestic adversity. Using both the cumulative method and latent class approach may be a more informative approach when examining the relationship between ACEs and later health outcomes. Future ACE studies may benefit by considering multi-dimensional approaches to operationalising adversity.","D000076783; D005163; D005260; D006801; D000077272; D008297; D000066550; D012189","Adverse Childhood Experiences; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Latent Class Analysis; Male; Physical Abuse; Retrospective Studies",NA,"NA",NA,"James Lian, Kim M Kiely, Kaarin J Anstey","School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, Kensington, NSW, Australia; Neuroscience Research Australia, Randwick, NSW, Australia."

Multidimensional poverty was associated with higher rates of depressive symptoms in the harmonised dataset (IRR (incidence rate ratio)=1.25, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.42), in Mexico (IRR=1.34, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.64) and Colombia (IRR=2.01, 95% CI 1.30 to 3.10) but not in South Africa, a finding driven by a lack of associations between child labour and health insurance coverage with depressive symptoms. There was only an association with income poverty and depressive symptoms in South Africa, not in Colombia or Mexico. Depressive symptoms were associated with individual deprivations such as school lag, child labour and lack of access to health services in the harmonised dataset, but not with household deprivations, such as parental unemployment and housing conditions, though the opposite pattern was observed in South Africa. Our findings suggest that the importance of specific dimensions of poverty for mental health varies across countries, and a multidimensional approach is needed to gain insights into the relationship between youth depression and poverty.","D000293; D000328; D002648; D003105; D003430; D003863; D006801; D008800; D011203; D013019; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Humans; Mexico; Poverty; South Africa; Young Adult",NA,"10.1017/S2045796015000086; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.04.027; 10.2105/AJPH.2009.180943; 10.2307/2657556; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.02.037; 10.1007/s00127-011-0457-6; 10.1023/A:1023903525276; 10.1007/s355-002-8326-3; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.05.005; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.12.040; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.10.023; 10.1016/j.jad.2018.11.055; 10.1377/hlthaff.2013.0133; 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2006.00433.x; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2008.01.011; 10.1037/a0027493; 10.1126/science.1232491; 10.1016/j.jebo.2017.04.003; 10.1111/ecoj.12210; 10.1177/1359105317718379; 10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004661; 10.1007/s11205-015-0964-z; 10.1080/00220380500405568; 10.1007/s00127-010-0202-6; 10.1017/s0033291700043993; 10.1016/S0749-3797(18)30622-6; 10.1186/s12888-016-1178-x; 10.1080/13676261.2010.538043; 10.1016/j.worlddev.2014.01.029; 10.1080/0376835X.2017.1392847; 10.1179/2049396714Y.0000000066; 10.4236/psych.2012.329113; 10.3390/ijerph17228479; 10.1056/NEJMsa0707519","Competing interests: None declared.","Annie Zimmerman, Crick Lund, Ricardo Araya, Philipp Hessel, Juliana Sanchez, Emily Garman, Sara Evans-Lacko, Yadira Diaz, Mauricio Avendano-Pabon","Health Service &amp; Population Research Department, King's College London - Strand Campus, London, UK."

Little is known about sex differences in the very early abstinence period, particularly in the context of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with varying anti-smoking policies and female smoking prevalences. We examined female sex effects on one-day relapse in a cross-national sample from 12 LMICs. Data from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (2008-2012) included nationally representative samples from 12 LMICs restricted to smokers with&#xa0;&#x2265;&#xa0;1 quit attempt in the past 12&#xa0;months (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;16,576). We ran adjusted logistic regression models for female sex effects on one-day relapse, adjusting for nine individual-level demographics (e.g., age, education, age at smoking initiation) and smoking cessation variables (e.g., exposure to health warnings, receipt of counseling). We then conducted a meta-analysis adjusted for national-level and policy measures through meta-regression (e.g., cigarette consumption per capita, percent of cigarette box covered with warning labels). One-day relapse prevalence varied across countries (2.7-13.6%). The odds of one-day relapse were significantly higher for women than for men in six countries (adjusted for nine individual-level sociodemographic variables), and there were no significant sex differences in the remaining six countries. Result remained significant after meta-regressions for national-level tobacco consumption and policy measures. Sensitivity analyses showed that the odds of one-day relapse for women remained significant when excluding countries with both higher and lower relative rates of female smoking. Larger warning labels on cigarette packs were associated with reduced odds of one-day relapse among women. The first day of a quit attempt is more challenging for women than men in LMICs. Tailored interventions incorporating national policies, in addition to counseling and pharmacotherapy, could play an essential role in supporting women during the initial abstinence phase of smoking cessation in LMICs.","D000328; D003376; D003906; D005260; D006801; D008297; D011203; D016540; D064424","Adult; Counseling; Developing Countries; Female; Humans; Male; Poverty; Smoking Cessation; Tobacco Use",NA,"NA",NA,"Jo&#xe3;o M Castaldelli-Maia, Elizabeth D Nesoff, Danielle R Lima, Zila M Sanchez, Silvia S Martins","Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, US."

With decades of displacement, forced migration, limited freedom of movement, violence and oppression, they have been termed by the United Nations (UN) as the 'most persecuted minority group' in world history. Literature shows an increased prevalence of psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, insomnia, etc., in this population. However, beyond 'medicalisation', the psychosocial challenges of the Rohingyas need to be understood through the lens of 'social suffering', which results from a complex interplay of multiple social, political, environmental and geographical factors. Lack of essential living amenities, poverty, unemployment, overcrowding, compromised social identity, and persistent traumatic stressors lead to inequality, restricted healthcare access, human rights deprivation and social injustice in this group. Even though the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) has taken a renewed interest in Rohingya re-establishment with well-researched standards of care, there are several pragmatic challenges in their implementation and inclusion in policies. This paper reviews these multi-dimensional psychosocial challenges of the Rohingyas by synthesising various intersecting conceptual models including minority stress, health-stigma-discrimination framework, refugee ecological model and capability approach. Furthermore, it highlights multidisciplinary interventions to mitigate these adversities, improve their living situation and eventually foster healing via means which are culturally relevant and contextually appropriate.

The impact of the illness does not only directly relate to poor health on infection but also social and political determinants of health. As such, the secondary effects of the pandemic have been profound. Mental health and well-being have been one such area of concern, with the causal links thought to occur in three ways. First: the impact on general population, particularly vulnerable groups such as BAME individuals; Second: the impact on people with pre-existing psychiatric disorders; Third: mental health of COVID patients and those who have recovered and their careers. There are lessons to be learnt from previous pandemics and the impact on mental health. There are high levels of anxiety, depression, substance use (particularly alcohol), posttraumatic stress symptoms, and survivor guilt. Within this context, there is a need to consider the differential impact on underprivileged populations. Vulnerable groups include women, children, elderly, minority racial and ethnic groups, LGBT + individuals and the poor.

In some areas, up to a third of HIV-positive women experience perinatal depression. Perinatal depression is associated with negative effects on parenting and key domains of child development including cognitive, behavioural and growth, especially in socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Several studies have documented the benefits of psychological interventions for perinatal depression in low- and middle-income countries, but none have evaluated an integrated psychological and parenting intervention for HIV-positive women using task-sharing. This randomised controlled trial aims to evaluate the effect of a home-based intervention, combining a psychological treatment for depression and a parenting programme for perinatally depressed HIV-positive women. This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial, consisting of 48-60 geospatial clusters. A total of 528 pregnant HIV-positive women aged &#x2265; 16&#x2009;years who meet the criteria for depression on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS, score &#x2265; 9)) are recruited from antenatal clinics in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The geospatial clusters are randomised on an allocation ratio of 1:1 to either the intervention or Enhanced Standard of Care (ESoC). The intervention group receives 10 home-based counselling sessions by a lay counsellor (4 antenatal and 6 postnatal sessions) and a booster session at 16&#x2009;months. The intervention combines behavioural activation for depression with a parenting programme, adapted from the UNICEF/WHO Care for Child Development programme. The ESoC group receives two antenatal and two postnatal counselling support and advice telephone calls. In addition, measures have been taken to enhance the routine standard of care. The co-primary outcomes are child cognitive development at 24&#x2009;months assessed on the cognitive subscale of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-Third Edition and maternal depression at 12&#x2009;months measured by the EPDS. The primary analysis will be a modified intention-to-treat analysis. The primary outcomes will be analysed using mixed-effects linear regression.

However, most of the research that led to this conclusion has been conducted with non-representative samples of individuals from higher-income backgrounds, and so further studies including participants from a broader range of socioeconomic backgrounds are required. Here, in a pre-registered study, we analyzed resting-state fMRI from 6839 children ages 9-10 years from the ABCD dataset.

For children from households defined as being in poverty, the direction of association was reversed, on average: better performance was instead directionally related to stronger LFPN-DMN connectivity, though there was considerable variability. Among children in households below poverty, the direction of this association was predicted in part by features of their environments, such as school type and parent-reported neighborhood safety.

We used an instrumental variable (IV) approach that exploits multiple changes in age eligibility from 1998 to 2012. Depressive symptoms were assessed using an 8-item version of the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; participants who scored above 8 were considered at risk for depression. Life satisfaction was rated on a scale of 1 ('very dissatisfied') to 10 ('very satisfied'); participants who scored 8 or above were classified as satisfied. We also examined impacts on educational deficit (&#x2265;2 years behind) and not being in education, employment or training (NEET) as secondary outcomes, as these are also important for mental health. Age eligibility strongly predicted CSG receipt at Wave 3. In instrumental variable models, CSG receipt did not influence the risk for depression (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.10, SE&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.10, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.316), nor life satisfaction (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.07, SE&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.09, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.420) at Wave 3, nor at Waves 4 or 5. Some improvements in educational deficit were observed at Wave 3 among CSG beneficiaries compared to non-beneficiaries. These results were robust to multiple specifications. CSG receipt did not improve the psychological wellbeing of adolescents and young adults, nor did it improve their education or employment outcomes.

This review aimed to synthesise qualitative evidence to understand the kind of experiences conflict-affected participants have and how these experiences occur during cc-MHPSS programme engagement in SSA. We searched Global Health, MEDLINE, Psychological Information Database, Embase Classic+Embase, Social Policy and Practice, Web of Science, Africa-Wide Information, PubMed and Global Index Medicus databases. Eligible publications qualitatively reported on conflict-affected participants' experiences of engagement in cc-MHPSS programmes. Data were extracted to summarise publication characteristics. The results were synthesised using a thematic synthesis analysis. The search yielded 953 records, of which 20 publications were included in the review. Included publications were located in Rwanda (n=8), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (n=3), Mozambique (n=3), Sierra Leone (n=1), Ghana (n=1), Uganda (n=1), Zimbabwe (n=1) and South Sudan (n=1); one publication included three countries (Sierra Leone, Liberia and Uganda). Findings include the themes of (1) the experience of change in time and space, and (2) the sharing and silence of participants' experiences. Findings demonstrate that elements transferred by participants from a cc-MHPSS programme to a natural community, and vice versa, contribute to participants' healing. Elements' transfer, or non-transfer, was often related to participants' disclosure, or non-disclosure, of experiences. Findings suggest that there are elements from a cc-MHPSS programme and a wider community which aid participant engagement and work therapeutically.

Therefore, we aimed to perform a systematic review of studies investigating the association of ACEs and childhood SES with AL in adult populations. Independent online searches covered the publication period up to 20th Jun 2021. A total of 27 studies were included in qualitative synthesis. The majority of eligible studies showed that ACEs (14 out of 19 studies recording ACEs, 73.7%) and low childhood SES (11 out of 12 studies recording childhood SES, 91.7%) are associated with elevated AL in adults. However, several processes were found to mediate or moderate this association. These include educational attainments, social support, health behaviors, adult stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, coping strategies and aging. Moreover, a substantial methodological heterogeneity of approaches to calculating the AL index was observed. Apart from reports from overlapping samples, none of eligible studies used the same set of biomarkers. Findings from this systematic review imply that early-life psychosocial stress might have a lasting impact on biological dysregulations captured by the AL index.

Further, diminished growth is more common in areas of extreme poverty, raising the possibility that it may mediate previously shown links between socioeconomic status (SES) and brain structure. To address these gaps, 79 children growing up in an extremely poor, urban area of Bangladesh underwent MRI at age six years. Structural brain images were submitted to Mindboggle software, a Docker-compliant and high-reproducibility tool for tissue segmentation and regional estimations of volume, surface area, cortical thickness, sulcal depth, and mean curvature. Diminished growth predicted brain morphometry and mediated the link between SES and brain morphometry most consistently for subcortical and white matter subcortical volumes. Meanwhile, brain volume in left pallidum and right ventral diencephalon mediated the relationship between diminished growth and full-scale IQ.

Latent growth curve modeling was used to examine the relation between discrimination and initial levels (intercept) and trajectories (slope) of depression symptoms over pregnancy. Participants were 129 pregnant individuals recruited from obstetric clinics and oversampled for elevated depression symptoms. Thirty-six percent of the participants were living at or below 200% of the federal poverty line. Fifty-four percent of the sample identified as non-Latinx White, 26% as Latinx, and 13% as non-Latinx Black. An unconditional latent growth curve modeling revealed a negative quadratic trajectory of depression symptoms during pregnancy. When women's report of discrimination was added as a predictor of depression trajectories, discrimination predicted the initial value (intercept) of depression symptoms, but not change over the course of pregnancy (slope). Specifically, higher levels of experiences of discrimination were associated with higher levels of depression symptoms. When sociodemographic and contextual covariates were included in the model, a low family income-to-needs ratio was also related to higher levels of depression symptoms.

These data highlight the importance of examining developmental trajectories of mental health as a function of key factors such as sex and socioeconomic environment.","D000293; D001921; D002648; D003071; D005260; D006801; D008137; D008297; D008603; D011599; D012111","Adolescent; Brain; Child; Cognition; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mental Health; Psychopathology; Residence Characteristics","U24 DA041147; U01 DA051039; U01 DA041120; K08 MH121654; K05 AA017242; U24 DA041123; U01 DA051038; U01 DA041106; U01 DA041117; U01 DA041148; U01 DA041174; UL1 TR001863; U01 DA041093; U01 DA041134; U01 DA041022; RF1 MH120025; U01 DA041156; U01 DA041025; U01 DA050989; U01 DA041089; U01 DA050988; U01 DA041028; U01 DA041048","NA","The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.","Deanna M Barch, Matthew D Albaugh, Arielle Baskin-Sommers, Brittany E Bryant, Duncan B Clark, Anthony Steven Dick, Eric Feczko, John J Foxe, Dylan G Gee,  ..., Laili Xie","Department of Psychiatry, University of California at San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive (0603), La Jolla, CA 92093-0603, United States."

We examined whether exposure to Brazil's conditional cash transfers programme (CCT), <i>Bolsa Fam&#xed;lia</i> (BFP), during childhood reduces the risk of mental health problems in early adolescence. We used data from 2063 participants in the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort study. Propensity score matching (PSM) estimated the association between BFP participation at age 6 and externalising problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire - SDQ and violent behaviour) and socio-emotional competencies (Development and Well-Being Assessment questionnaire, and the Nowick-Strickland Internal-External Scale) at age 11. PSM results suggest that programme participation at age of six was not significantly associated with externalising problems (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.433), prosocial behaviour (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.654), violent behaviour (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.342), social aptitudes (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.281), positive attributes (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.439), or locus of control (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.148) at the age of 11 years. Participation in BFP during childhood was not associated with improved or worsened mental health in early adolescence. While we cannot fully discard that findings may be due to adverse selection, results suggest that CCTs alone may not be sufficient to improve mental health outcomes and would be prudent to assess whether mental health interventions as an addition to CCTs may be helpful.","D000293; D000067697; D001938; D002648; D015331; D006801; D008603; D011203","Adolescent; Adolescent Health; Brazil; Child; Cohort Studies; Humans; Mental Health; Poverty",NA,"10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.04.027; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.04.026; 10.1016/j.avb.2013.07.003; 10.1007/s10964-005-9009-2; 10.1002/ajcp.12115; 10.1002/smi.2646; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2013.07.038; 10.1093/pch/9.8.575; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60754-X; 10.1017/S0047279418000715; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.112806; 10.3102/0034654317723008; 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60382-7; 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61676-7; 10.1542/peds.2008-2882; 10.1257/app.4.2.247; 10.1007/s11205-020-02367-y; 10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031811-124619; 10.1016/j.cpr.2014.11.003; 10.1017/S0954579410000416; 10.1590/0034-7612135532; 10.1590/S1415-98482013000200003; 10.1590/S1413-81232011000800030; 10.2471/BLT.10.084202; 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60715-1; 10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0827; 10.1186/1472-698X-14-10; 10.1590/1413-81232018246.19582017; 10.1016/j.ijedudev.2014.07.012; 10.1007/s00127-018-1627-6; 10.1093/ije/dyy170; 10.1590/s1518-8787.2017051006792; 10.1093/ije/dyq130; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.1997.tb01545.x; 10.1007/s10802-010-9434-x; 10.1590/S0102-311X2010001000003; 10.1007/s00127-008-0456-4; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2000.tb02345.x; 10.1097/01.chi.0000120021.14101.ca; 10.1192/bjp.bp.114.144519; 10.1037/h0033978; 10.1590/S0034-89102005000400002; 10.1590/s1518-8787.2017051006517; 10.1192/bjp.150.6.782; 10.1186/s12888-014-0284-x; 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01413; 10.1002/sim.5984; 10.1214/09-STS313; 10.1177/1536867X0200200403; 10.1007/s10567-010-0080-1; 10.1257/aer.20150503; 10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30382-5; 10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004661","Competing interests: The authors completed the ICJME Declaration of Interest Form (available upon request from the corresponding author) and declare no conflicts of interest.","Carolina Ziebold, Cristiane Silvestre Paula, In&#xe1; S Santos, Fernando C Barros, Tiago N Munhoz, Crick Lund, David McDaid, Ricardo Araya, Annette Bauer,  ..., Alicia Matijasevich","Postgraduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil."

This study investigated perceptions of, and motivations for, alcohol consumption during pregnancy and associated practices in a rural district of Lesotho. A combination of purposive and snowball sampling methods were used to identify pregnant women and mothers with young children from the general community, as well as from alcohol-serving venues. Between September 2016 and March 2017, a trained data collector conducted in-depth interviews with 40 women on reasons why pregnant women drink, what they know about the risk of drinking alcohol during pregnancy, and perceptions of women who drink during pregnancy. Sixty-five percent of women (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;26) reported that they consumed alcohol during pregnancy. Findings were clustered into four themes: 1) alcohol use in daily and cultural life; 2) alcohol as relief from stress and hunger; 3) alcohol's effect on the baby; and 4) access to information about alcohol consumption. Our data suggest that alcohol use was a prominent feature of daily life and a key part of traditional events and ceremonies. Other than potentially harming the baby through falling on their stomachs while inebriated, women did not mention other risks associated with prenatal alcohol use. Rather, there were prominent beliefs that drinking alcohol - home-brewed alcohol in particular - had cleansing or protective benefits for the baby. Experiences of food insecurity were prominent, and women reported that alcohol helped curb their hunger and allowed them to save food to give to their children. Within this context of chronic poverty and food insecurity, alcohol use during pregnancy will continue to represent a valid, though tragic choice if the structural conditions and current social arrangements that facilitate prenatal alcohol use remain unchanged.","D000428; D002648; D002675; D005260; D007722; D006801; D007927; D011247; D037841; D036301","Alcohol Drinking; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Lesotho; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Qualitative Research","R24 AA022919","NA",NA,"Marguerite Marlow, Hope Christie, Sarah Skeen, Stephan Rabie, Jacobus G Louw, Leslie Swartz, Shoeshoe Mofokeng, Moroesi Makhetha, Mark Tomlinson","Institute for Life Course Health Research, Department of Global Health, Stellenbosch University, Office 4009, 4th Floor, Education Building, Francie van Zijl Drive, Tygerberg, 7505, South Africa; School of Nursing and Midwifery, Queens University, Belfast, Medical Biology Centre, 97 Lisburn Road, Belfast, Northern Ireland, BT9 7BL, United Kingdom."

Children in poverty experience have a high risk for developmental delays. Poverty engenders disproportionate exposure to psychological adversity which may contribute to impaired offspring development; however the effect may be mitigated by social support and other aspects of resilience. Our objective was to determine the association between maternal stress, adversity and social support and early infant neurobehavior and child behavior at two and three years. We conducted a longitudinal mother-infant cohort study nested within a regional home visiting program in Cincinnati, Ohio. Four home study visits were completed to collect measures of maternal stress, adversity and social support and infant and child behavior. A measure of infant neurobehavior ('high-arousal' infant) was derived from the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) at 1&#xa0;month and externalizing and internalizing symptoms were measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at 24 and 36&#xa0;months. Linear and logistic regression identified associations between maternal risk/protective factors and infant and child behavioral measures. We used stratification and multiplicative interaction terms to examine potential interactions. We enrolled n&#x2009;=&#x2009;55 pregnant mothers and follow 53 mother-offspring dyads at 1&#xa0;month, 40 dyads at 24&#xa0;months and 27 dyads at 36&#xa0;months. Maternal adversity and protective factors were not associated with neurobehavior at one month. However, maternal depression and measures of distress in pregnancy were significantly associated with internalizing and externalizing symptoms at 24 and 36&#xa0;months. This pilot study established the feasibility of conducting longitudinal research within a community intervention program. In addition, although there were no statistically significant associations between maternal psychosocial factors in pregnancy and infant neurobehavior, there were several associations at 24&#xa0;months, primarily internalizing symptoms, which persisted through 36&#xa0;months.

Adults who have been exposed to such adversities exhibit premature and more severe age-related declines in brain health. Unfortunately, it remains unclear whether the negative effects of early life adversity (ELA) on brain health can be remediated through intervention in adulthood. Physical activity may represent a low-cost behavioral approach to address the long-term consequences of ELA on brain health. However, there has been limited research examining the impact of physical activity on brain health among adults with a history of ELA. Accordingly, the purpose of this review is to (1) review the influence of ELA on brain health in adulthood and (2) highlight evidence for the role of neurotrophic factors, hypothalamic-adrenal-pituitary axis regulation, inflammatory processes, and epigenetic modifications in mediating the effects of both ELA and physical activity on brain health outcomes in adulthood.

This study hence investigates the unexplored association between obesity and multimorbidity among older adults from LMICs. Cross-sectional, community-based data from the WHO Study on global Ageing and adult health (SAGE) were analysed. The sample consisted of 20,198 individuals aged &#x2265;60&#xa0;years [Mean age (SD)&#xa0;=&#xa0;69.3 (13.1) years; 54.1% female] from China, India, Ghana, Mexico, Russia, South Africa.

Significant associations emerged between obesity measures and five out of twelve chronic conditions. Results from this study underline the need to reduce obesity among older adults in areas where its prevalence is increasing, as it is associated with increased odds for multimorbidity. Future longitudinal research in this setting is required to assess the impact of obesity reduction on multimorbidity incidence.","D000368; D002681; D003430; D003906; D005260; D006801; D008297; D008875; D000076322; D009765; D011203; D015995","Aged; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Developing Countries; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multimorbidity; Obesity; Poverty; Prevalence","R01 AG034479; R21 AG034263","NA",NA,"Eugenia Romano, Ruimin Ma, Davy Vancampfort, Joseph Firth, Mireia Felez-Nobrega, Josep Maria Haro, Brendon Stubbs, Ai Koyanagi","Research and Development Unit, Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de D&#xe9;u, Universitat de Barcelona, Fundaci&#xf3; Sant Joan de D&#xe9;u, CIBERSAM, Barcelona, Spain; ICREA, Pg.

This was a two-stage inductive qualitative study situated within the naturalistic paradigm. This study committed to an interpretivist way of knowing (epistemology), and considered reality subjective and multiple (ontology).

In April-July 2020, 26 neurosurgeons from 11 LMICs participated in this study (n=24 in the focus groups, n=20 in follow-up interviews). The analysis gave rise to five themes: The local landscape; creating capacity; reach and impact; collaborative inquiry; growth and sustainability. Each theme contained an inhibitor and stimulus to neurosurgeons conducting and disseminating clinical research, interpreted as 'the neurosurgical research potential in LMICs'. Mentorship, education, infrastructure, impact and engagement were identified as specific accelerators. Whereas lack of generalisability, absence of dissemination and dissemination without peer review may desensitise the impact of research conducted by neurosurgeons. The geographical, political and population complexities make research endeavour challenging for neurosurgeons in LMICs. Yet in spite of, and because of, these complexities LMICs provide rich opportunities to advance global neurosurgery.

However, it remains unclear whether the presence of FTD characterises a specific subgroup of patients showing more prominent illness severity, neurocognitive and functional impairments. This study aimed to identify stable and generalizable FTD-subgroups of patients with recent-onset psychosis (ROP) by applying a comprehensive data-driven clustering approach and to test the validity of these subgroups by assessing associations between this FTD-related stratification, social and occupational functioning, and neurocognition. 279 patients with ROP were recruited as part of the multi-site European PRONIA study (Personalised Prognostic Tools for Early Psychosis Management; www.pronia.eu). Five FTD-related symptoms (conceptual disorganization, poverty of content of speech, difficulty in abstract thinking, increased latency of response and poverty of speech) were assessed with Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). The results with two patient subgroups showing different levels of FTD were the most stable and generalizable clustering solution (predicted clustering strength value&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.86). FTD-High subgroup had lower scores in social (p<sub>fdr</sub> &lt; 0.001) and role (p<sub>fdr</sub>&#xa0;&lt; 0.001) functioning, as well as worse neurocognitive performance in semantic (p<sub>fdr</sub> &lt; 0.001) and phonological verbal fluency (p<sub>fdr</sub>&#xa0;&lt; 0.001), short-term verbal memory (p<sub>fdr</sub>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002) and abstract thinking (p<sub>fdr</sub>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.010), in comparison to FTD-Low group. Clustering techniques allowed us to identify patients with more pronounced FTD showing more severe deficits in functioning and neurocognition, thus suggesting that FTD may be a relevant marker of illness severity in the early psychosis pathway.","D003071; D006801; D008570; D011618; D012660; D013850","Cognition; Humans; Memory, Short-Term; Psychotic Disorders; Semantics; Thinking","1859959","10.18637/jss.v025.i04",NA,"Oemer Faruk Oeztuerk, Alessandro Pigoni, Julian Wenzel, Shalaila S Haas, David Popovic, Anne Ruef, Dominic B Dwyer, Lana Kambeitz-Ilankovic,  ..., Stephan Ruhrmann","Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital of Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany."

The recent WHO Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE) guidelines focus on maintaining intrinsic capacity, i.e., addressing declines in neuromusculoskeletal, vitality, sensory, cognitive, psychological, and continence domains, aiming to prevent or delay the onset of dependence. The target group with 1 or more declines in intrinsic capacity (DICs) is broad, and implementation may be challenging in less-resourced settings. We aimed to inform planning by assessing intrinsic capacity prevalence, by characterising the target group, and by validating the general approach-testing hypotheses that DIC was consistently associated with higher risks of incident dependence and death. We conducted population-based cohort studies (baseline, 2003-2007) in urban sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela, and rural and urban sites in Peru, Mexico, India, and China. Door-knocking identified eligible participants, aged 65 years and over and normally resident in each geographically defined catchment area. Sociodemographic, behaviour and lifestyle, health, and healthcare utilisation and cost questionnaires, and physical assessments were administered to all participants, with incident dependence and mortality ascertained 3 to 5 years later (2008-2010). In 12 sites in 8 countries, 17,031 participants were surveyed at baseline. Overall mean age was 74.2 years, range of means by site 71.3-76.3 years; 62.4% were female, range 53.4%-67.3%. At baseline, only 30% retained full capacity across all domains. The proportion retaining capacity fell sharply with increasing age, and declines affecting multiple domains were more common. Poverty, morbidity (particularly dementia, depression, and stroke), and disability were concentrated among those with DIC, although only 10% were frail, and a further 9% had needs for care. Hypertension and lifestyle risk factors for chronic disease, and healthcare utilisation and costs, were more evenly distributed in the population. In total, 15,901 participants were included in the mortality cohort (2,602 deaths/53,911 person-years of follow-up), and 12,939 participants in the dependence cohort (1,896 incident cases/38,320 person-years). One or more DICs strongly and independently predicted incident dependence (pooled adjusted subhazard ratio 1.91, 95% CI 1.69-2.17) and death (pooled adjusted hazard ratio 1.66, 95% CI 1.49-1.85). Relative risks were higher for those who were frail, but were also substantially elevated for the much larger sub-groups yet to become frail. Mortality was mainly concentrated in the frail and dependent sub-groups. The main limitations were potential for DIC exposure misclassification and attrition bias. In this study we observed a high prevalence of DICs, particularly in older age groups. Those affected had substantially increased risks of dependence and death. Most needs for care arose in those with DIC yet to become frail. Our findings provide some support for the strategy of optimising intrinsic capacity in pursuit of healthy ageing. Implementation at scale requires community-based screening and assessment, and a stepped-care intervention approach, with redefined roles for community healthcare workers and efforts to engage, train, and support them in these tasks. ICOPE might be usefully integrated into community programmes for detecting and case managing chronic diseases including hypertension and diabetes.","D000367; D000368; D002681; D015897; D003704; D005260; D016330; D000073496; D000085542; D015577; D006306; D000073656; D006801; D015994; D057187; D007194; D007843; D008019; D008297; D008603; D011788; D012189; D018570; D012307; D013997","Age Factors; Aged; China; Comorbidity; Dementia; Female; Frail Elderly; Frailty; Functional Status; Geriatric Assessment; Health Surveys; Healthy Aging; Humans; Incidence; Independent Living; India; Latin America; Life Style; Male; Mental Health; Quality of Life; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors","001","10.1371/journal.pmed.1002948; 10.1001/archinte.166.4.418; 10.1016/j.jamda.2013.12.002; 10.1111/jgs.15003; 10.1371/journal.pone.0206445; 10.1016/j.maturitas.2018.11.006; 10.1136/jech-2011-200027; 10.1186/s12877-018-0785-4; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001435; 10.1093/geronb/gbu185; 10.1016/j.ypmed.2012.12.002; 10.1016/j.healthpol.2017.05.002; 10.1093/eurpub/cku093; 10.1093/geronb/gbv074; 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60342-6; 10.1016/j.jamda.2014.07.006; 10.7326/M16-0529; 10.1186/1471-2458-7-165; 10.1093/ije/dyw056; 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12772-9; 10.1192/bjp.bp.109.064055; 10.1186/s12888-015-0390-4; 10.1093/gerona/56.3.m146; 10.1016/j.jamda.2017.09.026; 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61829-8; 10.1186/1471-2318-10-53; 10.1017/s0033291700057779; 10.1136/jnnp.2010.234153; 10.1097/HJH.0b013e32834d9eda; 10.1186/s12889-019-6961-4; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001179; 10.1186/s12916-015-0378-4; 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-026119; 10.1002/nau.20041; 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61347-7; 10.1371/journal.pone.0149616; 10.1186/s12889-018-6350-4; 10.4103/2224-3151.213794; 10.1016/j.jval.2018.06.003; 10.3402/gha.v6i0.19228; 10.1186/s12877-015-0121-1; 10.1186/1472-6963-11-153; 10.1002/14651858.CD011083.pub2","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Martin J Prince, Daisy Acosta, Mariella Guerra, Yueqin Huang, K S Jacob, Ivonne Z Jimenez-Velazquez, A T Jotheeswaran, Juan J Llibre Rodriguez, Aquiles Salas,  ..., Adolfo Valhuerdi","Universidad de Ciencias M&#xe9;dicas de Matanzas, Matanzas, Cuba."

In this context, the Chilean government has launched a national strategy that involves actions in the health and social care system, including the promotion of DFC. From a multisectoral approach, social and environmental aspects involving engagement with local communities and access to social connections and services are directly related to urban policies. This perspective article focuses on urban aspects of social housing policy, such as placement, networks, affordability and the relationship between subsidy structure and adequate housing provision in a country with a qualitative housing deficit of around 1,200,000 units and where a large proportion of people with dementia and their families live in poverty. We identified several barriers to delivering appropriate environments for people living with dementia in relation to a two-fold problem: (a) the social housing subsidy displaces caregivers and/or older adults to satellite towns where social connections and access to services and urban equipment are lost; and (b) people resisting displacement live in overcrowded neighbourhoods where dementia is a common problem. In both scenarios, a detrimental environment and social conditions directly affect the quality of life of elderly people living with dementia and their caregivers.","D000368; D017028; D002677; D003704; D006798; D006801; D011788","Aged; Caregivers; Chile; Dementia; Housing; Humans; Quality of Life",NA,"10.1590/S1980-57642014DN84000003; 10.3389/fnagi.2017.00221; 10.3233/JAD-122086; 10.1371/journal.pone.0172204; 10.1017/S1041610216001654; 10.1097/YCO.0000000000000304; 10.1177/1471301217751533; 10.1016/j.amepre.2009.06.022; 10.1093/ageing/afv137; 10.1017/S1041610217000631; 10.1007/BF00905726; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.01.010; 10.1080/02673037.2015.1070796; 10.1016/j.tra.2020.08.018; 10.1093/geront/gnr098; 10.1186/s13104-016-2254-5; 10.1136/bmj.d4163; 10.1630/0956247053633692; 10.1080/14649365.2018.1509115; 10.1017/S1041610213000057; 10.1002/gps.1453; 10.1001/jama.2017.12067; 10.1016/S1474-4422(15)00101-5; 10.20944/preprints201910.0036.v1; 10.4067/S0250-71612016000100004; 10.29092/uacm.v13i32.525; 10.1080/17450100802095338; 10.1080/02723638.2016.1149311; 10.4067/S0718-83582011000300004; 10.2747/0272-3638.30.5.514; 10.13060/23362839.2020.7.2.512; 10.1037/tra0000793; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61689-4","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","Daniel A Jim&#xe9;nez, Francisca Cancino-Contreras","Francisca Cancino-Contreras, Facultad de Arquitectura, Dise&#xf1;o y Construcci&#xf3;n, Universidad de las Am&#xe9;ricas, Providencia, Chile."

We respond to concerns raised by Smith and Pollak about dimensional models of early experience and highlight the value of these models for studying the developmental consequences of early-life adversity. Basic dimensions of adversity proposed in existing models include threat/harshness, deprivation, and unpredictability. These models identify core dimensions of early experience that cut across the categorical exposures that have been the focus of specificity and cumulative risk approaches (e.g., abuse, institutional rearing, chronic poverty); delineate aspects of early experience that are likely to influence brain and behavioral development; afford hypotheses about adaptive and maladaptive responses to different dimensions of adversity; and articulate specific mechanisms through which these dimensions exert their influences, conceptualizing experience-driven plasticity within an evolutionary-developmental framework. In doing so, dimensional models advance specific falsifiable hypotheses, grounded in neurodevelopmental and evolutionary principles, that are supported by accumulating evidence and provide fertile ground for empirical studies on early-life adversity.","D005075; D001921; D006801","Biological Evolution; Brain; Humans","R01 MH103291; R01 MH106482; R37 MH119194; R56 MH119194","10.1017/S0954579413000242; 10.31219/osf.io/caqez; 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.02.004",NA,"Katie A McLaughlin, Margaret A Sheridan, Kathryn L Humphreys, Jay Belsky, Bruce J Ellis","Departments of Psychology and Anthropology, University of Utah."

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) such as poverty, family dysfunction, and child maltreatment, have been strongly and repeatedly associated with JJ involvement. A significant body of research from neuroscience has established that ACEs can alter facets of neurodevelopment that undergird self-regulation throughout childhood and adolescence, thereby increasing susceptibility to behaviors that attract attention of the JJ system. Because the ability to intervene prior to system-entrenchment is crucial to disrupting an adverse developmental pathway, we look toward neuroscience to offer insights into how to do so more effectively. In this chapter, evidence is summarized that informs an understanding of how neurodevelopmental pathways may lead to JJ involvement. Because neurodevelopment is malleable in response to both detrimental and positive experiences, there is potential for well-targeted interventions to normalize brain and cognitive development, especially during sensitive periods of maturation. This discussion is followed by a proposed research agenda to determine how to exploit these critical windows of opportunity to divert youth from persistent antisocial behavior and JJ involvement. Lastly, a review of neuroscience findings regarding the ability of intervention to strengthen brain systems that modulate self-regulation is presented. This research has direct practical significance with potential to be translated into meaningful policy change.","D000293; D001921; D002648; D006801; D007604; D009473; D012307","Adolescent; Brain; Child; Humans; Juvenile Delinquency; Neuronal Plasticity; Risk Factors",NA,"10.1001/archpsyc.61.4.403; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2008.10.005; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.07.012; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.09.009; 10.1176/jnp.2008.20.3.292; 10.1186/s12916-017-0895-4; 10.1016/j.jcbs.2013.06.001; 10.1056/NEJMra1315612; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2018.04.014; 10.1542/peds.2020-1651; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2012.04.020; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.2988; 10.1037/0012-1649.44.1.286; 10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101703; 10.1007/s10964-018-0934-2; 10.1016/j.dr.2007.08.003; 10.1037/bul0000270; 10.1007/s10567-020-00329-x; 10.1080/10538712.2011.607753; 10.4088/JCP.0706e02; 10.1016/j.psychres.2018.08.097; 10.1111/jcpp.12992; 10.3402/ejpt.v4i0.20274; 10.1146/annurev.psych.093008.100412; 10.1007/s00429-008-0189-x; 10.1007/s13142-015-0376-2; 10.1002/cad.20165; 10.1016/j.dcn.2017.03.006; 10.1007/s10648-005-5728-9; 10.1016/j.tics.2015.07.008; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2017.06.019; 10.1073/pnas.1307893110; 10.1093/cercor/bhp225; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2008.01.007; 10.1017/S0021963099004990; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.04.027; 10.1073/pnas.1909699116; 10.1891/vivi.2003.18.3.319; 10.1111/j.1744-1617.2010.01312.x; 10.1037/amp0000741; 10.1111/j.1745-9125.2002.tb00960.x; 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2015.04.010; 10.1542/peds.2015-3075; 10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00347; 10.1017/S0954579415000140; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113397; 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2016.06.007; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2018.09.005; 10.1002/dev.21968; 10.1177/0011128720926118; 10.1007/978-1-4419-9949-8; 10.1016/j.tins.2020.08.001; 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002328; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07071145; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.05.071; 10.1016/j.neuron.2013.06.028; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.10.012; 10.1146/annurev-devpsych-121318-084950; 10.1017/S0954579400007161; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01823.x; 10.1155/2019/1676285; 10.1016/j.dcn.2011.06.004; 10.1016/j.chc.2015.11.009; 10.1037/a0021441; 10.1080/15325020903004350; 10.1038/nrn3339; 10.1177/0165025411406860; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.04.026; 10.1007/s10964-013-9906-8; 10.1007/s00787-010-0149-x; 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2013.03.006; 10.1016/j.conb.2010.01.006; 10.1016/j.bandc.2009.07.003; 10.1007/s00213-013-3393-1; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01244.x; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.02.023; 10.1080/09602011.2011.605590; 10.1111/jcpp.12507; 10.1016/S0149-7634(03)00007-1; 10.1038/nrn.2016.111; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2010.00971.x; 10.3233/NRE-2011-0709; 10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2015.04.003; 10.18356/27bc31a5-en; 10.1152/jn.00557.2011; 10.1192/bjp.bp.116.181503",NA,"Shannon Chaplo, Diana Fishbein","FPG Child Development Institute, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."

Individuals living in impoverished crowded settings may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19-related stressors. How substantially marginalized groups like impoverished urban-dwelling individuals have been impacted during this pandemic is poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the associated factors of financial concerns and symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19 pandemic among impoverished urban-dwelling individuals residing in Dhaka, Bangladesh. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional survey was conducted between August and September 2020 using face-to-face interviews in six disadvantaged neighborhoods (""slums"") in Dhaka. Individuals were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire consisting of questions assessing socio-demographics, lifestyle, financial well-being relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, depression, and PTSD. <b>Results:</b> Four-hundred-and-thirty-five individuals (male = 54.7%; mean age = 45.0 &#xb1; 12.0 years; age range = 18-85 years) participated. Most (96.3%) reported that their household income decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors associated with decreased household incomes included female gender, primary education, joblessness, food scarcity and depression. Depression symptoms were linked to female gender, joblessness, divorce, living in a joint family, excessive sleep and smoking. Low incomes, excessive sleep, joblessness and food scarcity were positively associated with PTSD symptoms. In contrast, less sleep appeared protective against PTSD. <b>Conclusions:</b> Public health initiatives, in particular mental health services that target stress and biocentric approaches that consider how humans interact with multiple facets of nature, should be introduced to mitigate against potential financial and psychological effects of the pandemic on impoverished urban-dwelling individuals in Bangladesh.",NA,NA,"UL1 TR001863","10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30567-5; 10.1093/inthealth/ihz092; 10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102014; 10.1007/s10389-020-01432-7; 10.1016/j.puhip.2020.100024; 10.1080/09603123.2020.1802409; 10.1097/00007632-200012150-00014; 10.1007/s11469-020-00307-y; 10.3390/ijerph17165933; 10.1017/S0033291720000999; 10.3389/fpubh.2020.00341; 10.1080/15325024.2020.1763556; 10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8; 10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112934; 10.1186/s12888-020-02866-9; 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.559951; 10.23750/abm.v91i1.9397; 10.1080/23748834.2020.1801114; 10.1007/s42439-020-00031-0; 10.1371/journal.pone.0239254; 10.1093/ntr/ntw140; 10.1111/pcn.13127; 10.1016/j.sleh.2015.10.004; 10.1037/tra0000592; 10.1016/j.jad.2019.06.001; 10.1007/s11469-020-00243-x; 10.1007/s11469-020-00242-y; 10.1093/pubmed/fdaa182; 10.3390/ijerph18041453; 10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.049; 10.21203/rs.3.rs-210877/v1; 10.1177/0020764020954469; 10.1371/journal.pone.0247898; 10.1016/j.abrep.2020.100311; 10.3389/fpsyt.2021.647386; 10.1371/journal.pone.0245083; 10.1186/s12888-021-03246-7; 10.1093/pubmed/fdaa088; 10.1007/s11469-021-00569-0; 10.1016/j.psychres.2014.03.032; 10.1177/1359105320937057; 10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112921; 10.1016/j.smrv.2014.03.006; 10.3390/ijerph14111347; 10.2165/00023210-200620070-00003; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.11.014; 10.1136/jech-2013-202838; 10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_248_17; 10.1016/j.obmed.2020.100216; 10.1097/NMD.0b013e3182214154; 10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05392; 10.1080/13811118.2020.1833800; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106532; 10.2307/2061838; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105912; 10.1037/tra0000703; 10.1177/2167702613498727; 10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04063; 10.1001/jama.282.18.1737; 10.1016/j.psychres.2017.03.036; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2018.05.018; 10.5114/hpr.2021.103123; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105880; 10.1007/s11165-016-9602-2; 10.1080/23748834.2020.1791443; 10.1186/1471-244X-7-57; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105703; 10.1186/s12888-021-03243-w; 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.565153; 10.1186/s12888-018-1591-4; 10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30185-9; 10.3390/ijerph17051729; 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01168; 10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30046-8; 10.1186/s41256-020-00155-2; 10.3390/ijerph17072381; 10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05057","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","Md Saiful Islam, Md Estiar Rahman, Rajon Banik, Md Galib Ishraq Emran, Noshin Saiara, Sahadat Hossain, M Tasdik Hasan, Md Tajuddin Sikder, Lee Smith, Marc N Potenza","Department of Psychiatry and Child Study Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States."

The resulting network maps, i.e. parcellations, are now commonly used for the a priori identification of functional networks. However, the use of these parcellations, particularly in developmental and clinical samples, hinges on four fundamental assumptions: (1) the various parcellations are equally able to recover the networks of interest; (2) adult-derived parcellations well represent the networks in children's brains; (3) network properties, such as within-network connectivity, are reliably measured across parcellations; and (4) parcellation selection does not impact the results with regard to individual differences in given network properties. In the present study we examined these assumptions using eight common parcellation schemes in two independent developmental samples. We found that the parcellations are equally able to capture networks of interest in both children and adults. However, networks bearing the same name across parcellations (e.g., default network) do not produce reliable within-network measures of functional connectivity. Critically, parcellation selection significantly impacted the magnitude of associations of functional connectivity with age, poverty, and cognitive ability, producing meaningful differences in interpretation of individual differences in functional connectivity based on parcellation choice. Our findings suggest that work employing parcellations may benefit from the use of multiple schemes to confirm the robustness and generalizability of results. Furthermore, researchers looking to gain insight into functional networks may benefit from employing more nuanced network identification approaches such as using densely-sampled data to produce individual-derived network parcellations. A transition towards precision neuroscience will provide new avenues in the characterization of functional brain organization across development and within clinical populations.","D000293; D001921; D002648; D003071; D063132; D005260; D006801; D007090; D007206; D008279; D008297; D009434; D059906","Adolescent; Brain; Child; Cognition; Connectome; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Individuality; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neural Pathways; Neuroimaging","R01 MH103291; R01 MH106482; R37 MH119194; R56 MH119194","10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00073; 10.3389/fninf.2016.00002; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.09.025; 10.7717/peerj.784; 10.18637/jss.v067.i01; 10.1073/pnas.1912034117; 10.7554/eLife.32992; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.03.024; 10.17713/ajs.v46i2.561; 10.1016/j.neuron.2017.06.038,.e5; 10.1152/jn.00753.2019; 10.1152/jn.00808.2018; 10.1038/nrn2575; 10.1016/j.dcn.2018.03.001; 10.1073/pnas.1714021115; 10.1038/s41596-018-0065-y; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.03.020; 10.1006/cbmr.1996.0014; 10.1016/j.neuron.2020.01.029,.e8; 10.18637/jss.v031.i03; 10.1177/2515245920954925; 10.1152/jn.00529.2019; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.05.021; 10.1038/s41592-018-0235-4; 10.3389/fnsys.2012.00080; 10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101719; 10.1073/pnas.1208243109; 10.1007/s11682-016-9599-1; 10.1093/brain/awz026; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1324-15.2015; 10.1038/nature18933; 10.1093/cercor/bhu239; 10.1016/j.neuron.2017.07.011,.e7; 10.1038/sdata.2016.44; 10.1016/j.neuron.2018.03.035,.e5; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.01.079; 10.1101/812719; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.04.057; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2019.01.013; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2019.06.013; 10.1093/cercor/bhy123; 10.1016/j.jcm.2016.02.012; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117743; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.12.106; 10.1016/j.neuron.2015.06.037; 10.1073/pnas.1515083112; 10.1093/cercor/bhz255; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117653; 10.1038/s41398-019-0560-0; 10.1007/978-3-319-93177-7; 10.1016/j.neuron.2011.09.006; 10.1073/pnas.1716686115; 10.1002/hbm.23219; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.08.052; 10.1093/cercor/bhx179; 10.1093/cercor/bhy264; 10.2139/ssrn.2694998; 10.1073/pnas.0905267106; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116756; 10.1111/cdev.13005; 10.1093/cercor/bhz066; 10.1007/s10548-019-00744-6; 10.1038/s41598-020-72317-8; 10.1016/j.jaac.2019.08.471; 10.1038/s41467-018-05317-y; 10.1038/nmeth.1635; 10.1152/jn.00338.2011; 10.1016/j.bpsc.2018.12.012; 10.1073/pnas.1900801116",NA,"Nessa V Bryce, John C Flournoy, Jo&#xe3;o F Guassi Moreira, Maya L Rosen, Kelly A Sambook, Patrick Mair, Katie A McLaughlin","Department of Psychology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02139, United States."

All first contact patients seen at the Guam Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse (DMHSA) between January 2005 and December 2007 that met DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a psychotic disorder were included. At the time of the study, DMHSA was the only psychiatric facility in Guam. After controlling for age and gender, Chamorros, the indigenous people of Guam, had a standardized incidence rate (IR&#xa0;=&#xa0;151/100&#x2009;000 person-years, 95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;129-173) of FEP over twice that of Whites (IR&#xa0;=&#xa0;66/100&#x2009;000 person-years, 95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;34-99). Individuals from Palau had the highest standardized incidence rate (IR&#xa0;=&#xa0;832/100&#x2009;000 person-years, 95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;581-1083). Increased neighbourhood Chamorro density was associated with decreased incidence of FEP among Chamorro individuals (IRR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.11, 95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.03-0.43). After controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, and other neighbourhood factors, urbanicity (IRR&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.82, 95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.86-7.81), voting (IRR&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.06, 95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.32-3.20), poverty (IRR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.94, 95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.40-2.67), and crime (IRR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.18, 95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.00-1.40) remained statistically associated with FEP incidence. The findings add to prior research that suggests that rates of mental health problems are higher in indigenous than in settler communities and are highest for indigenous people who live in neighbourhoods with few other indigenous individuals. Findings also suggest that even on a small island, with only ~150&#x2009;000 people, urbanicity is associated with FEP. Finally, results are consistent with other research suggesting that the reduction of crime and social adversity can play a positive role in reducing the incidence of first episode psychosis.","D005006; D006141; D006801; D015994; D011618; D012111","Ethnicity; Guam; Humans; Incidence; Psychotic Disorders; Residence Characteristics",NA,"NA",NA,"Irwin Ford Rosenfarb, Rita Sharma-Gopinath, Vishal Bhavsar","Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College, London, UK."

Yet, cumulative cortisol secretion, as measured by hair cortisol, has not been examined longitudinally in relation to change in behavioral problems in young children. The current study examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between hair cortisol and changes in behavior problems in a combined sample (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;88) of two groups of young children from low-income families: 1) A trauma-exposed sample that participated in Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP) (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;43; Mean Age&#xa0;=&#xa0;4.31, SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.16; 53% Female; 77% Hispanic), and 2) A community sample of children from families experiencing high stress (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;45; Mean Age&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.20, SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.29; 67% Female; 58% Hispanic). Cortisol was assayed from hair collected from children at baseline and, on average, one year later. Mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist at the same time hair samples were collected. Baseline hair cortisol in children was not associated with maternally-reported child behavioral problems at baseline and did not predict change in behavior problems over time. In contrast, increases in cortisol were associated with greater improvement in child behavior problems (b&#xa0;=&#xa0;-2.98, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05), controlling for group status and relevant covariates. Subgroup analyses showed that cortisol change across one year significantly differed between the two groups (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.043): on average, community children exhibited a decrease, whereas CPP children demonstrated no change. Hair cortisol concentration was similarly related to improvements in mother-reported behavior problems across both CPP and community groups over time. In summary, there were no cross-sectional associations with hair cortisol, whereas increases were associated with improved child well-being. Findings demonstrate an important link between this increasingly common biomarker and child health, but suggest that changes over time may be more informative than cross-sectional associations.","D015415; D002653; D002675; D003430; D005260; D006197; D006801; D006854; D008137; D008297; D011203","Biomarkers; Child Behavior Disorders; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hair; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Poverty","R01 HL116511; UL1 TR000004","NA",NA,"Melissa Hagan, Michael Coccia, Luisa Rivera, Elissa Epel, Kirstin Aschbacher, Mark Laudenslager, Alicia Lieberman, Nicole R Bush","University of California, San Francisco, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, San Francisco, CA 94103, United States; University of California, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Developmental Medicine, San Francisco, United States."

However, in many countries, including in Rwanda, the use of traditional medicine is still popular despite the good accessibility and availability of conventional health services. This study aims to explore why traditional medicine is popularly used in Rwanda where it has achieved universal health coverage. The qualitative study, which included in-depth interviews and participant observations, investigated the experience of using traditional medicine as well as the perceived needs and reasons for its use in the Musanze district of northern Rwanda. We recruited 21 participants (15 community members and 6 traditional healers) for in-depth interviews. Thematic analysis was conducted to generate common themes and coding schemes. Our findings suggest that the characteristics of traditional medicine are responding to community members' health, social and financial needs which are insufficiently met by the current conventional health services. Participants used traditional medicine particularly to deal with culture-specific illness - uburozi. To treat uburozi appropriately, referrals from hospitals to traditional healers took place spontaneously. In Rwanda, conventional health services universally cover diseases that are diagnosed by the standard of conventional medicine. However, this universal health coverage may not sufficiently respond patients' social and financial needs arising from the health needs. Given this, integrating traditional medicine into national health systems, with adequate regulatory framework for quality control, would be beneficial to meet patients' needs.","D000328; D000368; D000369; D005260; D006801; D007407; D008297; D008519; D008875; D019370; D010342; D036301; D012432; D019472","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Middle Aged; Observation; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Qualitative Research; Rwanda; Universal Health Insurance","MSc scholarship Trust Fund; King's Global Mental Health Travel Fund","10.1089/acm.2007.7006; 10.1136/bmjgh-2019-001517; 10.1080/23288604.2018.1539058; 10.1016/0277-9536(88)90199-2; 10.1080/17531055.2017.1408324; 10.1080/17531050902972972; 10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002304; 10.1080/17441692.2016.1239269; 10.1371/journal.pone.0039282; 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60293-7; 10.1016/j.jep.2011.09.025; 10.1016/j.jep.2013.02.010; 10.7326/0003-4819-134-9_Part_2-200105011-00018; 10.1093/bmb/ldh006; 10.1159/000334488; 10.11622/smedj.2018051","All authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Mengxin Tan, Yuko Otake, Teisi Tamming, Valerie Akuredusenge, Beatha Uwinama, Fabien Hagenimana","Institut d'Enseignement Superieur (INES-Ruhengeri), Ruhengeri, Rwanda."

Secondary analyses of longitudinal datasets will be conducted in six low- and middle-income countries (Brazil, Colombia, Liberia, Malawi, Mexico and South Africa) to examine the impact of cash transfer programmes on mental health, and the mechanisms leading to improved life chances for young people living in poverty. Qualitative interviews and focus groups (conducted among a subset of three countries) will explore the views and experiences of young people, families and professionals with regard to poverty, mental health, life chances, and cash transfer programmes. Decision-analytic modelling will examine the potential economic case and return-on-investment from programmes.

However, little study to date has investigated associations between the attribution of poverty and suicide. Though we previously reported associations between socio-cultural factors, including income, and suicide, we tried to explore more focused associations between income, attribution of poverty (individualistic, societal), permissive attitude toward suicide, and suicidal thought using a structural equation model. A total of 2213 participants from each of three nations (South Korea, Japan, and the United States) completed an online survey. Participants without a history of psychological disorders or suicide attempts completed scales measuring attributions of poverty, attitudes toward suicide, and severity of suicidal thoughts. We established a structural equation model, which exhibited a good fit for all nations, and compared significant path coefficients by country. South Korea had the highest severity of suicidal thought and societal attribution of poverty, followed by Japan and America. In all nations, a permissive attitude was positively related to the severity of suicidal thought and individualistic attribution of poverty was positively related to a permissive attitude toward suicide. Societal attribution of poverty was positively associated with a permissive attitude in Japan and the United States. Income was negatively associated with the severity of suicide in South Korea and the United States. Through an established structural equation model, we found the influence of poverty on suicide and identify the common and distinctive factors associated with suicide in each country.","D001290; D006801; D007564; D011203; D056910; D059020; D014481","Attitude; Humans; Japan; Poverty; Republic of Korea; Suicidal Ideation; United States",NA,"NA",NA,"Hyunju Lee, C Hyung Keun Park, Sang Jin Rhee, Bora Kim, Sang Sin Lee, Kyooseob Ha, Chang Jae Baik, Yong Min Ahn","Department of Psychiatry, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Neuropsychiatry, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Institute of Human Behavioral Medicine, Seoul National University Medical Research Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea."

Long-term outcomes of an early intervention on maternal depressed mood and child cognitive development: follow-up of a randomised controlled trial.","Child cognitive development is often compromised in contexts of poverty and adversity, and these deficits tend to endure and affect the child across the life course. In the conditions of poverty and violence that characterise many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), the capacity of parents to provide the kind of care that promotes good child development may be severely compromised, especially where caregivers suffer from depression. One avenue of early intervention focuses on the quality of the early mother-infant relationship. The aim of this study was to examine the long-term impact of an early intervention to improve the mother-infant relationship quality on child cognitive outcomes at 13&#x2009;years of age. We also estimated the current costs to replicate the intervention. We re-recruited 333 children from an early childhood maternal-infant attachment intervention, 'Thula Sana', when the children were 13&#x2009;years old, to assess whether there were impacts of the intervention on child cognitive outcomes, and maternal mood. We used the Kaufman Assessment Battery to assess the child cognitive development and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) to assess maternal mental health. Effect estimates indicated a pattern of null findings for the impact of the intervention on child cognitive development. However, the intervention had an effect on caregiver psychological distress (PHQ-9, ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.17 [CI: -1.95, 0.05] and SRQ-20, ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.30 [CI: -2.41, -0.19]), but not anxiety. The annual cost per mother-child pair to replicate the Thula Sana intervention in 2019 was estimated at ZAR13,365 ($780). In a socio-economically deprived peri-urban settlement in South Africa, a home visiting intervention, delivered by community workers to mothers in pregnancy and the first six postpartum months, had no overall effect on child cognitive development at 13&#x2009;years of age. However, those caregivers who were part of the original intervention showed lasting improvements in depressed mood. Despite the fact that there was no intervention effect on long-term child outcomes, the improvements in maternal mood are important.","D000293; D002657; D002675; D003071; D005260; D005500; D006792; D006801; D007223; D009035; D016487; D011247","Adolescent; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Cognition; Female; Follow-Up Studies; House Calls; Humans; Infant; Mothers; Parenting; Pregnancy","MR/S02400X/1","NA",NA,"Mark Tomlinson, Sarah Skeen, G J Melendez-Torres, Xanthe Hunt, Chris Desmond, Barak Morgan, Lynne Murray, Peter J Cooper, Sujit D Rathod,  ..., Pasco Fearon","Developmental Neuroscience Unit, University College London, London, UK."

They occur in certain eco-epidemiological foci that reflect manipulation by human activities, such as migration, urbanization and deforestation, of which poverty, conflict and climate change are key drivers. Given their synergistic impacts, risk factors and the vulnerabilities of poor populations and the launch of a new 2030 roadmap for NTDs in the context of the global sustainability agenda, it is warranted to update the state of knowledge of the leishmaniases and their effects. Using existing literature, we review socioeconomic and psychosocial impacts of leishmaniasis within a framework of risk factors and vulnerabilities to help inform policy interventions. Studies show that poverty is an overarching primary risk factor. Low-income status fosters inadequate housing, malnutrition and lack of sanitation, which create and exacerbate complexities in access to care and treatment outcomes as well as education and awareness. The co-occurrence of the leishmaniases with malnutrition and HIV infection further complicate diagnosis and treatment, leading to poor diagnostic outcomes and therapeutic response. Even with free treatment, households may suffer catastrophic health expenditure from direct and indirect medical costs, which compounds existing financial strain in low-income communities for households and healthcare systems. The dermatological presentations of the leishmaniases may result in long-term severe disfigurement, leading to stigmatization, reduced quality of life, discrimination and mental health issues. A substantial amount of recent literature points to the vulnerability pathways and burden of leishmaniasis on women, in particular, who disproportionately suffer from these impacts. These emerging foci demonstrate a need for continued international efforts to address key risk factors and population vulnerabilities if leishmaniasis control, and ultimately elimination, is to be achieved by 2030.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1093/inthealth/ihv071; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0000599; 10.1111/j.1365-3024.2009.01117.x; 10.4269/ajtmh.2009.81.373; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02279.x; 10.1590/S0074-02762008000700005; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002543; 10.1186/s13071-016-1743-7; 10.1186/s12982-017-0065-3; 10.1186/s12879-015-0830-2; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2006.01604.x; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2010.02520.x; 10.4269/ajtmh.2011.10-0683; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002062; 10.4269/ajtmh.12-0585; 10.1080/14787210.2019.1555471; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003527; 10.3390/pathogens9100809; 10.7554/eLife.02851; 10.35500/jghs.2020.2.e3; 10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00517-6; 10.1016/j.pt.2013.12.004; 10.1111/j.1365-2230.2004.01605.x; 10.4269/ajtmh.15-0408; 10.1186/s12889-018-5260-9; 10.1371/journal.pone.0223313; 10.1371/journal.pone.0242494; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002865; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0007616; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008680; 10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110289; 10.1186/s40249-020-00790-4; 10.1186/s40249-017-0379-y; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2012.02960.x; 10.1093/ije/dym275; 10.7705/biomedica.v36i2.2953; 10.4269/ajtmh.2005.73.74; 10.3329/bjz.v45i1.34197; 10.1590/S0037-86822001000600003; 10.4269/ajtmh.2009.81.195; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0000639; 10.1016/j.pt.2006.09.004; 10.1038/nrmicro1748; 10.1016/j.trstmh.2005.09.017; 10.9745/GHSP-D-20-00028; 10.1590/S0102-311X2009000700025; 10.3109/03639041003796648; 10.1371/journal.pone.0035671; 10.1038/s41591-020-1059-1; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006778; 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13861-5; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2006.01732.x; 10.1128/CMR.00048-18; 10.4103/1596-3519.55704; 10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.03.007; 10.1016/S1473-3099(02)00347-X; 10.1136/bmj.38917.503056.7C; 10.1186/s40249-018-0491-7; 10.1093/cid/cix607; 10.1007/978-3-319-70060-1_6-1; 10.1016/j.ijwd.2016.04.003; 10.1016/j.puhe.2020.05.039; 10.1016/j.ijwd.2019.01.002; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002869; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0007132; 10.1016/j.nut.2019.110712; 10.1186/s13071-014-0470-1; 10.2147/HIV.S143929; 10.1128/CMR.00061-07; 10.1038/s41586-019-1200-9; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2010.02612.x; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003258; 10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.05.011; 10.2147/HIV.S93789; 10.4269/ajtmh.16-0883; 10.3201/eid2205.160042; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0004545; 10.1016/j.trstmh.2007.06.001; 10.5588/ijtld.19.0267; 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60922-3; 10.1007/s11356-020-08896-w; 10.1371/journal.pone.0129869; 10.2807/ese.15.10.19505-en; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0009006; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008925; 10.7759/cureus.11318; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005231; 10.1111/tmi.12916; 10.1126/sciadv.aaq1012; 10.1038/s41558-018-0253-3; 10.3390/ijerph13040443; 10.1016/0140-6736(90)90313-T; 10.1093/ije/25.4.862; 10.1089/vbz.2010.0068; 10.1016/j.ijid.2014.04.023; 10.3201/eid2010.140288; 10.2340/00015555-1988; 10.1603/ME13053; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001407; 10.1186/s13071-018-3019-x; 10.1186/s13071-019-3507-7; 10.1186/s13071-020-04058-6; 10.1186/s13071-020-04448-w; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2010.02516.x; 10.4269/ajtmh.2003.69.624; 10.5812/semj.82810; 10.1155/2018/3025185; 10.1590/0102-311x00136419; 10.1186/1478-4505-11-31; 10.1093/heapol/czn052; 10.1371/journal.pone.0155482; 10.1590/0037-8682-0133-2017; 10.1111/tmi.12994; 10.1186/1471-2334-7-3; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0007092; 10.7241/ourd.20171.21; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0000259; 10.3201/eid1104.040945; 10.18502/jad.v12i2.44; 10.1371/journal.pone.0189906; 10.1186/s12889-017-4132-z; 10.1371/journal.pone.0227911; 10.1371/journal.pone.0203407; 10.1186/s12955-017-0720-y; 10.1093/trstmh/traa160; 10.1073/pnas.1814484116; 10.4269/ajtmh.13-0150; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005781; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006250; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2012.03027.x; 10.1016/S0140-6736(18)30698-6; 10.1093/inthealth/ihu052; 10.5061/dryad.05f5h","All authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.","Grace Grifferty, Hugh Shirley, Jamie McGloin, Jorja Kahn, Adrienne Orriols, Richard Wamai","Department of Cultures, Societies and Global Studies, Northeastern University, College of Social Sciences and Humanities, Integrated Initiative for Global Health, Boston, MA, USA."

The hypothesis that early parenting quality has significant long-term financial benefits has not been previously tested. Design: Longitudinal study with follow-up from 2012 to 2016. UK multicentre study cohort (London, South-East England). 174 young people drawn from 2 samples, one at moderate risk of poor outcomes and one at high risk, assessed aged 4-6&#x2009;years then followed up in early adolescence (mean age 12.1&#x2009;years). The primary outcome was total costs: health, social care, extra school support, out-of-home placements and family-born expenditure, determined through semistructured economic interviews. Early parenting quality was independently assessed through direct observation of parent-child interaction. Costs were lower for youths exposed to more sensitive parenting (most sensitive quartile mean &#xa3;1,619, least sensitive quartile mean &#xa3;21,763; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). Costs were spread across personal family expenditure and education, health, social and justice services. The cost difference remained significant after controlling for several potential confounders. These included demographic variables (family poverty, parental education); exposure to child abuse; and child/young person variables including level of antisocial behaviour in both childhood and adolescence, IQ and attachment security. This study is the first showing that more sensitive early parental care predicts lower costs to society many years later, independent of poverty, child and youth antisocial behaviour levels and IQ. Savings are likely to increase as individuals grow older since early parenting quality predicts health, behavioural and occupational outcomes in adulthood. The findings provide novel evidence for the public health impact of early caregiving quality and likely financial benefits of improving it.","D000293; D000328; D002648; D002675; D017046; D006801; D008137; D010287; D016487; D010290","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Cost Savings; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Parent-Child Relations; Parenting; Parents",NA,"NA",NA,"Christian J Bachmann, Jennifer Beecham, Thomas G O'Connor, Jackie Briskman, Stephen Scott","National Academy for Parenting Research, King's College London, London, UK."

Although there are reviews that have focused on applied interventions from different perspectives, there is still a need for a comprehensive review of what has been attempted with these children from the cognitive intervention field. The aim of this paper is to present a protocol for a systematic review collecting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studies whose purpose was to enhance cognitive development through the implementation of cognitive interventions in children and adolescents (&lt; 18 years old) from low socioeconomic Status (SES) settings. The following databases will be searched: Web of Science (WoS core collection), PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, ERIC, PubMed, ICTRP and Opengrey Register (System for Information of Grey Literature in Europe). Searches will be adapted for each database. Additionally, the reference list of articles included in the review will also be searched. As part of this process, two reviewers will determine, independently, the suitability of each article taking into account predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Pertinent data will then be extracted, including sample characteristics, specifics of the intervention, and outcomes, as well as follow-up measures. Internal validity will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. A quantitative synthesis of results will be conducted using a meta-analysis. However, if a meta-analysis is difficult to implement due to the diversity of the studies (for example, in terms of measures used to estimate the effect size, intervention types, outcomes, etc.), the technique synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) will be used. A description of outcome measures will be provided, as measured by validated neuropsychological instruments of any cognitive function. The systematic review will offer a framework based on evidence to organisations, institutions, and experts who want to implement or promote interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive domains in children and adolescents who live in disadvantaged contexts.

Health conditions can be both causes and consequences of violence, of shared community-level socio-economic risk factors, and can result from large-scale social forces beyond the control of populations with high levels of violence. The aim of the study was to provide an in depth understanding of the Public Health problem of violence among young adult men in Glasgow East. Ecological investigation of violence and its associations with health conditions in areas of contrasting socioeconomic deprivation. National survey of 1916 British men aged 18-34&#x2009;years, augmented by a sub-sample of 765 men in Glasgow East (GE). Participants completed questionnaires covering current physical and sexual health, psychiatric symptoms, substance misuse, lifestyle, and crime and violence. The 5-year prevalence of violence was similar in both surveys but fights involving weapons (AOR 3.32, 95% CI 2.29-4.79), gang fights (AOR 2.30, 95% CI 1.77-2.98), and instrumental violence supporting criminal lifestyles were more common in GE, where 1 in 9 men had been in prison. Violent men in both samples reported poorer physical and sexual health and all types of psychiatric morbidity except depression, with multiple high-risk behaviours for both future poor health and violence. Associations between drug and alcohol dependence and violence in GE could not be entirely explained by deprivation. Violence in deprived urban areas is one among many high-risk behaviours and lifestyle factors leading to, as well as resulting from, aggregations of both psychiatric and physical health conditions. Poverty partly explained raised levels of violence in GE. Other factors such as drug and alcohol misuse and macho attitudes to violence, highly prevalent among men in this socially excluded community, also contributed. Multi-component preventive interventions may be needed in deprived areas and require future investigations into how multiple co-existing risk factors produce multimorbidity, including psychiatric disorders, substance misuse, poor physical health and violence.","D000374; D006801; D008297; D001523; D015995; D012307; D012606; D014754; D055815","Aggression; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Scotland; Violence; Young Adult",NA,"10.1007/s12117-017-9328-1; 10.1136/jech.2009.095018; 10.1186/s12889-018-5267-2; 10.1016/j.puhe.2017.05.016; 10.1016/j.healthplace.2016.05.007; 10.1590/S1413-81232006000200007; 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135231; 10.1080/09581596.2019.1564223; 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30003-X; 10.1093/ije/14.1.32; 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)11133-0; 10.2105/AJPH.72.12.1336; 10.1093/schbul/sbw006; 10.1093/aje/kwj339; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1983.tb09716.x; 10.1159/000081413; 10.1080/14789940802045182; 10.1017/S0954579400007318; 10.1177/1745691611419672; 10.1016/S2468-2667(17)30118-4; 10.1016/S2215-0366(14)00128-X; 10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30262-5; 10.1016/S2468-2667(19)30248-8; 10.1016/j.ehb.2009.09.005; 10.1111/mcn.12231; 10.1192/bjp.2020.69; 10.1007/s11524-009-9348-5; 10.1177/00333549101250S411; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02222.x; 10.1016/S2468-2667(19)30145-8; 10.1371/journal.pone.0055952; 10.1016/j.amepre.2019.12.022; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002381; 10.1353/dem.2006.0014; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.11.033; 10.1177/1090198113492761; 10.1016/j.healthplace.2012.04.001; 10.4278/0890-1171-10.4.308; 10.1007/s10464-015-9736-9; 10.1016/j.pmedr.2016.08.004; 10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.11.071; 10.1371/journal.pone.0055942; 10.1017/S0033291798008174","None declared.

Using Sprague Dawley rats, the present study explored the impact of limited resource availability on maternal behavior and physiological and emotional behavior outcomes in the offspring. Early life adversity was induced by incorporating aspects of the limited bedding and nesting and scarcity models, wherein limited resource availability has previously been shown to provoke unpredictable or adverse maternal care respectively. In our hands, neonatal limited bedding (NLB) stress during postnatal days (P)2-9 altered maternal care, augmenting pup-directed behaviors and reducing self-directed behaviors, and modestly increased the frequency of transitions between discrete behaviors across consecutive timed observations. NLB-exposed pups had lower core body temperatures immediately following the stressful manipulation and exhibited decreased body weight gain across development. However, NLB exposure did not impact adult offspring's social or emotional behavior outcomes in the three-chamber social interaction, novelty-suppressed feeding, splash, or forced swim tests. These findings add to the literature demonstrating that early life adversity impacts maternal care in rodents and can disrupt certain metabolic and thermoregulatory outcomes in the offspring.","D000328; D000818; D000831; D004644; D005260; D006801; D008425; D051381; D017207; D012377; D013315; D013696","Adult; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Emotions; Female; Humans; Maternal Behavior; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Rodentia; Stress, Psychological; Temperature","R01 MH105447","10.1037/0735-7036.103.1.83; 10.1016/j.yfrne.2014.05.004; 10.1007/s00406-005-0624-4; 10.1371/journal.pone.0101437; 10.1038/s41386-018-0137-2; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.11091347; 10.1016/j.tins.2020.02.004; 10.1016/J.YHBEH.2016.04.010; 10.1111/1471-6402.00090; 10.1017/S0954579417000128; 10.1159/000350716; 10.1007/s10802-013-9818-9; 10.1016/j.cobeha.2016.12.012; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2017.08.023; 10.1016/J.YNSTR.2018.01.002; 10.3389/fnbeh.2019.00030; 10.1016/j.yfrne.2019.100768; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2281-05.2005; 10.1152/physrev.00015.2003; 10.1016/j.jad.2003.12.013; 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2010.02.004; 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2007.03.009; 10.1159/000374108; 10.1021/acschemneuro.7b00042; 10.1073/pnas.1703444114; 10.1002/dev.21547; 10.1111/ejn.14609; 10.1007/s00213-010-1916-6; 10.1016/S0749-3797(98)00017-8; 10.3389/fnbeh.2019.00167; 10.1093/ije/31.2.359; 10.1017/S0033291703008377; 10.1111/ejn.14315; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2014.10.044; 10.1016/J.YFRNE.2019.01.002; 10.1038/s41386-018-0195-5; 10.1152/ajpregu.1987.252.6.r1130; 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2017.09.025; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.4602; 10.1002/dev.20494; 10.1016/J.PSYNEUEN.2016.02.004; 10.1371/journal.pone.0010404; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.04.019; 10.3791/2473; 10.1016/S0165-0327(02)00426-3; 10.1001/archpsyc.1994.03950010008002; 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2019.04.001; 10.1016/J.YHBEH.2020.104822; 10.1016/j.physbeh.2020.112957; 10.1073/pnas.1310163110; 10.3389/fnmol.2019.00027; 10.3109/10253890.2015.1117448; 10.1038/tp.2015.200; 10.1002/dev.21230; 10.1002/dev.420190504; 10.1037/h0077599; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4106-09.2009; 10.1371/journal.pone.0155037; 10.1152/ajpregu.00185.2016; 10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00109; 10.1096/fj.201600834R; 10.1016/j.ynstr.2020.100269; 10.1073/pnas.2020173118; 10.1016/B978-0-12-802456-0.00002-9; 10.1038/266730a0; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5843-11.2012; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.12.019; 10.1038/npp.2014.266; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.04.026; 10.1210/en.2008-0633; 10.1002/dev.420170108; 10.1016/J.BIOPSYCH.2008.11.028; 10.1002/dev.21218; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.01.032; 10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.05.017; 10.1111/1469-7610.00037; 10.1136/jnnp.2007.136895; 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2019.01.003; 10.1080/10253890.2017.1343296; 10.1016/0278-5846(90)90073-P; 10.1097/YCO.0000000000000122; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.12.012; 10.1096/fj.201802297R; 10.1038/tp.2016.276","Conflict of Interest Statement.

The present review aimed to update a published review of 5 years of empirical studies on universal parenting programs to strengthen positive parenting and prevent child maltreatment. A systematic search of the PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Lilacs, and SciELO databases was performed to identify the studies of group-based structured parenting programs published from 2015 to 2019. Eighteen studies were found that fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results showed that 14 different parenting programs were conducted in high-, medium-, and low-income countries, showing an increase in the number of studies in low-income countries compared with the previous review. In 89% of the studies, the parenting outcomes improved in the post-intervention. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that these programs also improved other parental outcomes such as mental health, couple relationships, coparenting, and coping ability of parents. From 18 studies, nine child variables were evaluated, and eight of them showed a decrease in behavior problems. Regarding the methodological quality of the studies, 55%, 28%, and 17% were classified as moderate, weak, and strong, respectively. In conclusion, the positive changes in parenting and child behavior outcomes encourage the implementation of parenting programs as a universal prevention strategy.

The purpose of the symposium was to share neuroscience nursing research from around the world. One of the topics thought most notable that stimulated a crucial conversation was how different countries assessed pain and their use of opioids for pain management. BACKGROUND: Neuroscience nurses are global. What is not known is their experience with and what challenges exist with pain management for human beings in their country. Crossing geographic and cultural boundaries, pain affects all human beings. Each culture has unique values and beliefs regarding pain. Patient barriers, pivotal in this article, included poverty, poor health literacy, opioid phobia, and cultural as well as social beliefs. RESULTS: Neuroscience nurses from Australia, Brazil, Germany, Singapore, India, Ghana, Kenya, Philippines, South Africa, and the United States each collaborated to provide a short summary of assessing pain and use of opioids for pain management for the neuroscience patient. CONCLUSION: Neuroscience patients have varying degrees of pain based on many factors. Various countries have religious, spiritual, and cultural traditions that influence the reporting and management of pain. Pain assessment and management can be challenging, especially for the neuroscience nurses around the world.","D000701; D006801; D065816; D015399; D010146; D010147; D014481","Analgesics, Opioid; Humans; Neuroscience Nursing; Nursing Research; Pain; Pain Measurement; United States",NA,"10.1016/j.ejpain.2011.05.006; 10.1016/j.jpain.2008.04.004; 10.2147/JPR.S197803; 10.1093/pm/pnw237; 10.1016/j.jpain.2007.02.430; 10.1177/106939710003400203; 10.4103/0973-1075.197955; 10.1136/jme.2006.018887; 10.1016/S1754-3207(08)60007-3; 10.37719/jhcs.2019.v1i2.rna004; 10.1024/1012-5302/a000687; 10.1024/1012-5302/a000717; 10.1051/fopen/2019007; 10.1097/JNN.0000000000000446; 10.1097/JNN.0000000000000093; 10.1093/pch/pxx126","The authors declare no conflicts of interest.","Cynthia Bautista, Mary P Amatangelo, Priya Baby, Anne-Kathrin Cassier-Woidasky, Kaleigh Dycus, Esther I Edoh, Theresa Green, Karen Czarina S Ilano, Mary Kemboi,  ..., Jennifer L Wessol",NA

This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the evidence on the effectiveness of cash transfers to improve the mental health of children and young people in low-income and middle-income countries. We searched Pubmed, EBSCOhost, Scientific Electronic Library Online, ISI Web of Science and Social Sciences Citation Index and grey literature (from January 2000 to July 2020) for studies which quantitatively assessed the impact of cash transfers on mental health in young people (aged 0-24 years), using a design that incorporated a control group. We extracted Cohen's d effects size and used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis on studies that measured depressive symptoms, I<sup>2</sup> statistic and assessment of study quality. We identified 12&#x2009;116 articles for screening, of which 12 were included in the systematic review (covering 13 interventions) and seven in the meta-analysis assessing impact on depressive symptoms specifically. There was high heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>=95.2) and a high risk of bias (0.38, 95% CIs: -5.08 to 5.85; p=0.86) across studies. Eleven interventions (85%) showed a significant positive impact of cash transfers on at least one mental health outcome in children and young people. However, no study found a positive effect on all mental health outcomes examined, and the meta-analysis showed no impact of cash transfers on depressive symptoms (0.02, 95% CIs: -0.19 to 0.23; p=0.85). Cash transfers may have positive effects on some mental health outcomes for young people, with no negative effects identified. However, there is high heterogeneity across studies, with some interventions showing no effects. Our review highlights how the effect of cash transfers may vary by social and economic context, culture, design, conditionality and mental health outcome.","D000293; D002648; D003906; D006801; D007182; D008603; D011203","Adolescent; Child; Developing Countries; Humans; Income; Mental Health; Poverty",NA,"10.1016/j.jad.2017.12.050; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.04.027; 10.1093/ije/dyr103; 10.1097/01.CHI.0000070261.24125.F8; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.05.005; 10.1126/science.aay0214; 10.1080/19439342.2014.890362; 10.1093/heapol/czy020; 10.1001/jama.298.16.1900; 10.1590/1413-81232018246.19582017; 10.1080/19439340902924043; 10.1007/s00127-017-1370-4; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60754-X; 10.1186/1471-2458-8-409; 10.1080/19439341003646188; 10.1080/00220388.2015.1134773; 10.1192/bjp.bp.112.119164; 10.1007/s00787-005-0491-6; 10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub2; 10.31235/osf.io/ydr54; 10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30382-5; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097; 10.1002/14651858.CD008137; 10.1002/jrsm.1355; 10.1136/bmj.d5928; 10.1136/bmj.315.7109.629; 10.1086/605941; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2011.08.008; 10.1136/jech-2012-201601; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.03.003; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2015.06.011; 10.1371/journal.pone.0226809; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2015.09.023; 10.1542/peds.2008-2882; 10.1093/qje/qjr032; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.01.037; 10.1371/journal.pone.0178076; 10.1016/j.ssmph.2019.100527; 10.1257/app.4.2.247; 10.1007/s10461-018-2329-5; 10.1111/j.1467-7679.2006.00348.x; 10.1136/jech-2018-211746","Competing interests: None declared.","Annie Zimmerman, Emily Garman, Mauricio Avendano-Pabon, Ricardo Araya, Sara Evans-Lacko, David McDaid, A-La Park, Philipp Hessel, Yadira Diaz,  ..., Crick Lund","Health Service &amp; Population Research Department, King's College London Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, London, UK."

We conducted a scoping review of reviews to determine key barriers and innovative strategies which can contribute to attaining universal health coverage (UHC), from early detection to effective interventions for autism in low- and middle-income countries (LAMIC). A systematic literature search of review articles was conducted. Reviews relevant to the study research question were included if they incorporated papers from LAMIC and focused on children (&lt;eight years old) with autism or their caregivers. The database search was supplemented with bibliographic search of included articles and key informant suggestions. Data were extracted and mapped onto a Theory of Change model toward achieving UHC for autism in LAMIC. We identified 31 articles which reviewed data from over fifty countries across Africa, Latin America, Middle East, and Asia and addressed barriers across one or more of four inter-related domains: (a) the social context and family experience for a child with autism; (b) barriers to detection and diagnosis; (c) access to appropriate evidence-based intervention; and (d) social policy and legislation. Key barriers identified included: lack of appropriate tools for detection and diagnosis; low awareness and experienced stigma impacting demand for autism care; and the prevalence of specialist models for diagnosis and treatment which are not scalable in LAMIC. We present a Theory of Change model which describe the strategies and resources needed to realize UHC for children with autism in LAMIC. We highlight the importance of harnessing existing evidence to best effect, using task sharing and adapted intervention strategies, community participation, and technology innovation. Scaling up these innovations will require open access to appropriate detection and intervention tools, systematic approaches to building and sustaining skills in frontline providers to support detection and deliver interventions embedded within a stepped care architecture, and community awareness of child development milestones.","D000067877; D002648; D002657; D002675; D003906; D006801; D011203; D012196; D019472","Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Developing Countries; Humans; Poverty; Review Literature as Topic; Universal Health Insurance","G0401546; MR/R006164/1; 001; MR/K005863/1","NA",NA,"Gauri Divan, Supriya Bhavnani, Kathy Leadbitter, Ceri Ellis, Jayashree Dasgupta, Amina Abubakar, Mayada Elsabbagh, Syed Usman Hamdani, Chiara Servili,  ..., Jonathan Green","Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Manchester and Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre, Manchester, UK."

In the multivariate model, perceptions related to ease of access of illicit drugs (marijuana: p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.028, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#x2009;3.81, -&#x2009;0.22; crack-cocaine: p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#x2009;7.40, -&#x2009;4.90), and deviant behavior (threatening someone with a gun: p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.028, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#x2009;2.57, -&#x2009;0.14) remained independent predictors of early age of crack-cocaine initiation. Early onset of crack-cocaine use seems to be associated with exposure to family conflict, easy access to drugs and deviant behavior. Treatment and preventive programs should take these factors into account when designing and implementing community interventions.","D000293; D001938; D019970; D016578; D003430; D006801; D019966","Adolescent; Brazil; Cocaine-Related Disorders; Crack Cocaine; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Substance-Related Disorders","402762/210-0 and Announcement 41/2010 - Line I","10.1016/j.bbr.2015.04.036; 10.4088/JCP.15m09894; 10.1515/revneuro-2018-0118; 10.4088/jcp.v67n0211; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.08.036; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2010.07.026; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.00804.x; 10.1111/j.1521-0391.2012.00245; 10.1016/j.drugpo.2013.03.012; 10.1590/2237-6089-2014-0043; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2010.02.010; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2013.10.019; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2008.10.021; 10.1111/add.14280; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2013.09.030; 10.1016/j.adolescence.2016.01.006; 10.1001/archpsyc.65.6.674; 10.1111/add.13785; 10.1037/0022-3514.84.2.390; 10.1016/j.tics.2005.02.008; 10.1017/S0033291707009920; 10.1111/add.13097; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.104880; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2008.01.015; 10.1080/00048674.2010.501759; 10.1111/j.1465-3362.2009.00145.x; 10.1097/ADM.0000000000000047; 10.1111/ajad.12764; 10.1037/0012-1649.27.1.172; 10.2307/1131228; 10.1017/S0954579400006854; 10.1023/a:1021800432380; 10.1016/S0005-7894(03)80035-7; 10.15288/jsad.2012.73.173; 10.1097/ADT.0000000000000173; 10.1097/00004583-200207000-00017; 10.2105/ajph.74.7.668; 10.1007/BF01538684; 10.15288/jsad.2018.79.370; 10.1037/0021-843X.116.1.213; 10.1353/mpq.2010.0002; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2006.12.011; 10.1037/0893-164X.20.4.415; 10.1375/twin.14.1.1; 10.1002/mpr.242; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2006.12.014; 10.1038/nature13402; 10.1375/13690520460741462; 10.1001/archpsyc.1981.01780330019001; 10.1111/1467-8624.00210; 10.1001/jama.289.4.427PubMed; 10.1093/aje/155.10.918; 10.1016/0306-4603(95)00059-3; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2014.03.002; 10.1046/j.1359-6357.2003.00586.x; 10.1037/1064-1297.5.2.150; 10.1016/S0306-4603(01)00277-5","The authors declare that they have no relevant competing interests.","Luciane Ogata Perrenoud, Koki Fernando Oikawa, Anna Virginia Williams, Ronaldo Laranjeira, Benedikt Fischer, John Strang, Marcelo Ribeiro","Department of Psychiatry, Federal University of S&#xe3;o Paulo (UNIFESP), S&#xe3;o Paulo, Brazil, Rua Major Maragliano, 241, SP, 04017030, S&#xe3;o Paulo, Brazil."

Data were extracted from EHRs of 3350 people (62% male patients) who had presented to the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust with a FEP between 1 April 2007 and 31 March 2017. Logistic regression was used to examine gender differences in the presentation of positive, negative, depressive, mania and disorganisation symptoms. Gender (male vs female). Presence of positive, negative, depressive, mania and disorganisation symptoms at initial clinical presentation. Eight symptoms were significantly more prevalent in men (poverty of thought, negative symptoms, social withdrawal, poverty of speech, aggression, grandiosity, paranoia and agitation). Conversely, tearfulness, low energy, reduced appetite, low mood, pressured speech, mood instability, flight of ideas, guilt, mutism, insomnia, poor concentration, tangentiality and elation were more prevalent in women than men. Negative symptoms were more common among men (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.62) and depressive and manic symptoms more common among women (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.35). After adjustment for illicit substance use, the strength of associations between gender and negative, manic and depression symptoms increased, whereas gender differences in aggression, agitation, paranoia and grandiosity became insignificant. There are clear gender differences in the clinical presentation of FEP. Our findings suggest that gender can have a substantial influence on the nature of clinical presentation in people with psychosis, and that this is only partly explained by exposure to illicit substance use.","D004581; D005260; D006801; D008131; D008297; D009323; D011618; D012727; D019966","Electronics; Female; Humans; London; Male; Natural Language Processing; Psychotic Disorders; Sex Characteristics; Substance-Related Disorders","MC_PC_17214; MR/T045302/1; MR/S003118/1","10.1002/wps.20490; 10.1371/journal.pone.0031660; 10.1007/s00737-018-0847-9; 10.1155/2012/916198; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2012.11.005; 10.1155/2015/430735; 10.1111/eip.12235; 10.1093/schbul/22.2.257; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2009.36; 10.1016/j.schres.2009.07.002; 10.1007/s00127-008-0384-3; 10.1017/S0033291718000399; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2016.09.003; 10.1186/s12888-014-0256-1; 10.1093/schbul/sbx197; 10.1016/S2215-0366(16)30379-0; 10.1007/s00281-018-0723-8; 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012012; 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-028929; 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-007619; 10.3389/fpsyt.2020.577110; 10.1017/S0033291709990651; 10.1016/j.schres.2006.07.018; 10.1097/01.nmd.0000253784.59708.dd; 10.1136/bmj.323.7325.1336; 10.1155/2015/615356; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.5; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00554.x; 10.1016/S0920-9964(00)00114-6; 10.1016/S0924-9338(03)00027-0; 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.968792","Competing interests: All authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure form at www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf and declare: RS has received research funding from Roche, Janssen, GSK and Takeda.

One concern is the potential impact of genomics research on stigma experienced by people affected by a disease. Studies have found that the type of illness as well as disease causal beliefs impact on the relation between genetic attribution and stigma. This study explored the potential impact of genetic attribution of disease on stigma among Xhosa people with Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD). Study participants were 46 Xhosa people with RHD living in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Using video vignettes in 7 focus group discussions we explored whether and how genetic attribution may impact on disease-stigma. Vignettes introduced participants to non-genetic and genetic causal explanations and were followed-up with a series of open-ended questions eliciting their perceptions of non-genetic disease causes as well as genetic causation and its impact on internalised stigma. This study found that Xhosa people with RHD have a general understanding of genetics and genetic attribution for disease. Additionally, and not withstanding their genetic knowledge, these participants hold multiple disease causal beliefs including genetic, infectious disease, psychosocial, behavioural and cultural explanations. While there was evidence of internalised stigma experiences among participants, these appeared not to be related to a genetic attribution to the disease. The findings of this study provide clues as to why it is unlikely that a genetic conceptualisation of disease impacts internalised stigma experiences of Xhosa people. The causal explanations provided by participants reflect their cultural understandings and their context, namely, living in low-income and poverty-stricken environments. Divergence in these findings from much of the evidence from high-income countries emphasises that context matters when considering the impact of genetic attribution on stigma and caution against generalising findings from one part of the globe to another.","D044383; D017144; D023281; D006801; D057545; D013019","Black People; Focus Groups; Genomics; Humans; Social Stigma; South Africa","U01 HG008226; U24 HL135600; U54 HG009790","NA","<b>Competing interests:</b> All authors state that there is no conflict of interest.","Olivia P Matshabane, Megan M Campbell, Marlyn C Faure, Paul S Appelbaum, Patricia A Marshall, Dan J Stein, Jantina de Vries","Department of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa."

PRESSED Project Study Protocol.","The PRESSED project aims to explain the links between a multidimensional measure of precarious employment and stress and health. Studies on social epidemiology have found a clear positive association between precarious employment and health, but the pathways and mechanisms to explain such a relationship are not well-understood. This project aims to fill this gap from an interdisciplinary perspective, integrating the social and biomedical standpoints to comprehensively address the complex web of consequences of precarious employment and its effects on workers' stress, health and well-being, including health inequalities. The project objectives are: (1) to analyze the association between multidimensional precarious employment and chronic stress among salaried workers in Barcelona, measured both subjectively and using biological indicators; (2) to improve our understanding of the pathways and mechanisms linking precarious employment with stress, health and well-being; and (3) to analyze health inequalities by gender, social class and place of origin for the first two objectives. The study follows a sequential mixed design. First, secondary data from the 2017 Survey on Workers and the Unemployed of Barcelona is analyzed (<i>N</i> = 1,264), yielding a social map of precarious employment in Barcelona that allows the contextualization of the scope and characteristics of this phenomenon. Drawing on these results, a second survey on a smaller sample (<i>N</i> = 255) on precarious employment, social precariousness and stress is envisaged. This study population is also asked to provide a hair sample to have their levels of cortisol and its related components, biomarkers of chronic stress, analyzed. Third, a sub-sample of the latter survey (n = 25) is selected to perform qualitative semi-structured interviews. This allows going into greater depth into how and why the experience of uncertainty, the precarization of living conditions, and the degradation of working conditions go hand-in-hand with precarious employment and have an impact on stress, as well as to explore the potential role of social support networks in mitigating these effects.","D004651; D006801; D012923; D000083663; D011795; D014478","Employment; Humans; Social Class; Social Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Unemployment",NA,"10.1093/esr/jcn033; 10.5477/cis/reis.138.135; 10.5271/sjweh.3860; 10.3917/rfs.462.0351; 10.1016/j.ssci.2017.01.015; 10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032013-182500; 10.1136/oem.2009.048967; 10.1016/j.gaceta.2015.06.008; 10.1590/0102-311x00156215; 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-029577; 10.5271/sjweh.3720; 10.1177/1757913920971333; 10.13075/ijomeh.1896.01553; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.11.033; 10.1080/02678370500408723; 10.5271/sjweh.628; 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.12.027; 10.1007/s00420-015-1107-1; 10.5271/sjweh.3845; 10.3233/WOR-2011-1140; 10.1177/0950017008093477; 10.1177/1035304617722943; 10.1016/j.gaceta.2015.04.002; 10.1155/2013/978656; 10.1177/1403494820956451; 10.1002/ajim.20781; 10.1093/ije/dyv342; 10.1177/0022146510383499; 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198565895.003.02; 10.1136/bmj.314.7092.1472; 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.1.102803.144141; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.08.006; 10.1007/s00420-019-01443-2; 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2009.09.006; 10.1097/YCO.0b013e328363b4ed; 10.1097/HJR.0b013e328336923a; 10.1093/eurheartj/ehm584; 10.1371/journal.pone.0030978; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2006.10.005; 10.5483/BMBRep.2015.48.4.275; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2012.11.015; 10.1080/08870446.2016.1247841; 10.1210/jc.2011-1551; 10.1080/10253890.2017.1340452; 10.4172/2157-7536.1000183; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.06.011; 10.4324/9781315194868-14; 10.4324/9781315593838; 10.1037/1076-8998.1.1.27; 10.1016/S0277-9536(03)00349-6; 10.1093/eurpub/14.3.314; 10.2190/607H-TTV0-QCN6-YLT4; 10.1007/s00420-011-0718-4; 10.1136/bmj.c2154; 10.3109/00048674.2010.509311; 10.1089/jwh.2007.0596; 10.1177/0961463X14549505; 10.1177/1103308814557398; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.09.038; 10.1111/ap.12176; 10.1017/CBO9780511815447; 10.1016/j.socnet.2016.08.006; 10.1177/0197918318812343; 10.1037/0033-2909.98.2.310; 10.1016/j.healthplace.2017.02.007; 10.1111/1468-2397.00205; 10.3238/arztebl.2011.0047; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.01.050; 10.3346/jkms.2018.33.e149; 10.1037/a0040107; 10.1186/s12889-016-3358-5; 10.1177/0958928707087590; 10.1177/0002716220923959; 10.1007/s11135-015-0259-0; 10.1016/j.socnet.2004.11.003; 10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.415; 10.1177/0950017018822918; 10.1016/S0191-8869(02)00091-0; 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780192631961.003.0001; 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195301014.003.0003; 10.1177/1558689806292430; 10.5944/empiria.16.2008.1388; 10.1016/j.shaw.2019.10.002; 10.1111/ijsw.12132; 10.1097/00005650-198807000-00006; 10.11144/Javeriana.upsy11-3.aeci; 10.2307/2136404; 10.1016/S0022-3999(01)00275-6; 10.1177/1403494812470400; 10.1016/j.chroma.2019.460648; 10.1016/j.chroma.2020.461179; 10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.082103.104918; 10.17169/fqs-16.1.2092","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","Mireia Bolibar, Francesc Xavier Belvis, Pere J&#xf3;dar, Alejandra Vives, Fabrizio M&#xe9;ndez, Xavier Bartoll-Roca, Oscar J Pozo, Alex Gomez-Gomez, Eva Padrosa,  ..., Mireia Juli&#xe0;","Research Group on Health Inequalities, Environment, and Employment Conditions (GREDS-EMCONET), Department of Political and Social Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain."

Mother-infant attachment was coded during a mother-infant interaction when the infants were aged 12 months. Electrophysiological correlates of social processing (mean amplitude of the Nc component) were measured while infants viewed facial images of the mother and a stranger at age 6 months. Infants in the intervention group were more securely attached and more involved with their mothers than those receiving CAU at 12 months. Smaller Nc amplitudes to the mother's face at 6 months were associated with better social behavior at 12 months.

Using the casefiles of 376 school children registered in a Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) project in the Northwest governorate of Idleb in Syria, this study aimed to determine (i) the rates of various protection concerns (potential mental health conditions, psychosocial deprivation issues, and social, behavioural and emotional issues) for students enrolled in this project, (ii) whether the rates of any of the protection concerns varied between children and adolescents, or between boys and girls, and (iii) which of the identified demographic and protection sector factors predicted the presence of potential mental health conditions and MHPSS intervention outcomes. MHPSS interventions (including individual MHPSS sessions tailored for children in conflict, resilience building activities, tutoring, peer building activities, community awareness, and other tailored services) were implemented at schools operated by the UK-based organization, Syria Relief. The variables tested included demographic variables of age group (208 children, aged 4-9&#x2009;years; 168 adolescents, aged 10-14&#x2009;years) and gender (211 males, 165 females), and 23 protection sector variables including 11 potential mental health problems (anxiety, attention&#xa0;deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, autism, epilepsy, motor tics, depression, post-traumatic-stress disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, learning disability), 7 psychosocial deprivation (PSD) variables (war injury, child labour, loss of caregiver, neglect, domestic abuse, displacement, poverty), and 5 social, behavioural and emotional (SBE) variables (low/abnormal socialization, emotional issue, peer issues/being bullied, peer issues/being aggressive, educational decline). Within the sample, 73.7% were found with a probable mental health problem, with 30.6% showing signs of anxiety, 36.2% of depression and 26.6% showing signs of post-traumatic-stress disorder. Additionally, 74.5% of the sample had at least one form of PSD present (42.6% were displaced, 39.6% suffered from abject poverty), and 64.9% had a reported SBE concern. Children were more likely to have a potential mental health concern, especially autism and PTSD, and poor socialization; while adolescents were more likely to engage in child labour, experience abject poverty, exhibit aggressive behaviour, and educational decline. Male gender was associated with child labour and aggressive behaviour while female gender was associated with the presence of potential mental health problems, especially depression, and loss of caregiver, and poor socialisation. Odds ratios (ORs) indicated significant negative impact of the presence of SBE concerns (any), 4.45 (95% CI: 1.68-12.7), emotional issue, 11.02 (95% CI: 2.76-74.49), low/abnormal socialization, 8.37 (95% CI, 2-57.71), and displacement, 2.91 (95% CI, 1.21-7.48) on the child's mental health.

Thus, this study investigated the relationship between physical multimorbidity and social participation among older adults across 6 LMICs. Cross-sectional, community-based data including adults aged 65 years and older from 6 LMICs were analyzed from the WHO Study on Global AGEing and adult health survey. The association between 11 individual chronic conditions or the number of chronic conditions (independent variable) and social participation (range 0-10 with higher scores indicating greater social participation; dependent variable) was assessed by multivariable linear regression analysis. 14,585 individuals (mean age 72.6 [SD 11.5] years; 54.9% females) were included. Among individual conditions, hearing problems, visual impairment, and stroke were significantly associated with lower levels of social participation. Overall, an increasing number of chronic conditions was dose-dependently associated with lower levels of social participation (e.g., &#x2265;4 vs 0 conditions: &#x3b2; = -0.26 [95% CI = -0.39, -0.13]). The association was more pronounced among males than females. Older people with multimorbidity had lower levels of social participation in LMICs.

We also conducted a literature search using PubMed, Google scholar on ES in all the African countries. We received responses from the majority of African countries, which allowed us to identify 3 levels of care for ES in African countries, a first level that uses ES with invasive presurgical evaluation, a second level that uses ES but without invasive presurgical evaluation, and a third level that does not use ES, and we summarized these results on a map.

This study developed and tested the effects of a novel, evidence-based, brief smoking intervention culturally targeted for disadvantaged Black smokers (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04460417). <b><i>Method:</i></b> In this randomized controlled trial, primarily low-income Black non-treatment-seeking smokers (<i>N</i> = 204, 51% female) were randomized to enhanced care (EC) or treatment as usual (TAU). The EC group received a 30-min session with personal feedback on smoking, education on health outcomes and tobacco advertising targeting Black smokers, and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) starter kits. TAU included provision of self-help materials. Primary outcome was motivation to change smoking behavior, and secondary outcomes included NRT knowledge and use, quit attempts, and number of cigarettes smoked per day. Data were collected at baseline, 1- and 6-month follow-ups. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Compared with TAU, EC increased motivation to change (<i>p</i> = .02), accuracy in NRT knowledge, (<i>p</i> &lt; .001), NRT use (<i>p</i> = .01), and likelihood of making a serious quit attempt as well as reduced cigarettes smoked per day (<i>p</i> &lt; .01) through 6-month follow-up. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> A brief motivational intervention for Black non-treatment-seeking smokers increased motivation to change smoking and resulted in improvements in NRT knowledge, use, and quit-relevant behaviors. Findings support cultural-targeting and provision of NRT to enhance motivation in Black smokers to reduce cultural and institutional barriers to tobacco cessation.

At present, limited data are available on GBS in LMIC and the true incidence of GBS in many LMIC remains unknown. Increased understanding of GBS in LMIC is needed because poor hygiene and high exposure to infections render populations in LMIC vulnerable to GBS outbreaks. Furthermore, insufficient diagnostic and health-care facilities in LMIC contribute to delayed diagnosis in patients with severe presentations of GBS. In addition, the lack of national clinical guidelines and absence of affordable, effective treatments contribute to worse outcomes and higher mortality in LMIC than HIC. Systematic population-based surveillance studies, cohort and case-control studies are required to understand the incidence and risk factors for GBS. Novel, targeted and cost-effective treatment strategies need to be developed in the context of health system challenges in LMIC. To ensure integrative rehabilitation services in LMIC, existing prognostic models must be validated, and responsive outcome measures that are cross-culturally applicable must be developed. Therefore, fundamental and applied research to improve the clinical management of GBS in LMIC should become a critical focus of future research programmes.","D003906; D014943; D020275; D006801; D007167; D011203","Developing Countries; Global Health; Guillain-Barre Syndrome; Humans; Immunotherapy; Poverty","K43 TW011447","10.1093/brain/awt285; 10.1038/nrneurol.2014.121; 10.1016/S1474-4422(08)70215-1; 10.1056/NEJMoa1605564; 10.1111/jns.12358; 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00562-6; 10.1016/j.ncl.2013.01.005; 10.1007/s00415-016-8192-2; 10.1056/NEJMra1114525; 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00339-1; 10.1093/brain/awm004; 10.1093/brain/awy232; 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181cff735; 10.1089/fpd.2009.0493; 10.1017/S0950268813001908; 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022862; 10.1007/s00415-017-8429-8; 10.1159/000052111; 10.1212/WNL.0000000000007719; 10.1111/jns.12215; 10.1016/j.jocn.2017.08.048; 10.1159/000324710; 10.1159/000184748; 10.3201/eid1707.101999; 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67665-9; 10.1212/WNL.56.11.1467; 10.1136/jnnp-2014-309056; 10.1586/1744666X.2013.811119; 10.1093/cid/ciu005; 10.1093/brain/118.3.597; 10.1016/S2214-109X(15)00151-5; 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181df5b66; 10.1007/BF00314485; 10.11604/pamj.2014.18.35.2911; 10.1046/j.1468-1331.2003.00683.x; 10.1111/j.1600-0404.1996.tb00169.x; 10.1016/j.jns.2016.08.014; 10.4103/0972-2327.91942; 10.1016/j.jocn.2018.11.031; 10.1371/journal.pone.0003674; 10.1111/j.1600-0404.2011.01503.x; 10.4103/0972-2327.83087; 10.1128/CMR.00006-15; 10.1016/S1474-4422(07)70130-8; 10.1136/jnnp-2013-306212; 10.1136/jnnp-2013-306509; 10.1212/WNL.57.4.686; 10.1371/journal.pone.0133520; 10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.05.119; 10.1212/WNL.0000000000006246; 10.1016/j.jns.2017.02.024; 10.1111/j.1468-1331.2006.01071.x; 10.3329/jhpn.v28i6.6602; 10.1002/acn3.50946; 10.1016/S0165-5728(99)00213-1; 10.1128/JCM.43.1.335-339.2005; 10.3201/eid1802.111126; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005869; 10.1016/S0163-4453(99)90031-2; 10.1136/pgmj.68.799.376; 10.1212/WNL.41.6.812; 10.1186/s13104-015-1672-0; 10.1590/S0004-282X2004000100025; 10.1016/j.jocn.2020.04.062; 10.1056/NEJMc2009191; 10.1016/S1474-4422(20)30109-5; 10.1016/j.neurol.2020.04.003; 10.1016/j.ajem.2020.09.029; 10.1016/j.neurol.2020.04.007; 10.1093/brain/awaa433; 10.1093/infdis/jix511; 10.1136/jnnp-2020-324491; 10.1007/s00415-020-10124-x; 10.1111/jns5.12074; 10.1016/j.jneuroim.2006.05.018; 10.1371/journal.pone.0192703; 10.1177/026010609601000401; 10.1016/j.ensci.2019.02.001; 10.3201/eid2301.161290; 10.1186/s12916-018-1052-4; 10.1038/nature06536; 10.1016/S1474-4422(20)30232-5; 10.1016/j.jcv.2016.01.016; 10.3390/ijerph15010096; 10.1136/jnnp-2020-324230; 10.1002/ana.410270707; 10.1111/jns.12189; 10.1111/j.1529-8027.2012.00433.x; 10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.09.123; 10.1159/000503101; 10.1007/s00415-011-6330-4; 10.1212/WNL.51.4.1110; 10.1212/WNL.0b013e31820e7b62; 10.1055/s-2007-981686; 10.1136/jnnp-2016-314862; 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30055-7; 10.3109/0886022X.2014.890859; 10.1002/acn3.706; 10.4103/0973-6247.187940; 10.1093/qjmed/hcv190; 10.1038/s41582-019-0250-9; 10.1186/s13054-015-1123-2; 10.1186/1471-2377-13-95; 10.1016/j.ejpn.2010.11.008; 10.3390/ijerph15102165; 10.1136/jnnp-2011-301882; 10.1136/jnnp.2004.051136; 10.1159/000445347; 10.1007/s00415-010-5653-x; 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182104407; 10.1111/ane.12995; 10.1111/jns.12234; 10.1111/jns.12320; 10.1136/jnnp.2005.081547; 10.1111/jns.12119; 10.1111/j.1529-8027.2009.00238.x; 10.3346/jkms.2017.32.7.1154","The authors declare no competing interests.","Nowshin Papri, Zhahirul Islam, Sonja E Leonhard, Quazi D Mohammad, Hubert P Endtz, Bart C Jacobs","Department of Neurology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands."

This is particularly true for marginalized groups, presenting a fundamental challenge to decreasing racial, economic, and gender-based health disparities. Physical and social environments influence genome function, including the transcriptional activity of core stress responsive genes. We studied the relationship between social experiences that are associated with systemic inequality (e.g., racial segregation, poverty, and neighborhood violence) and blood cell (leukocytes) gene expression, focusing on the activation of transcription factors (TF) critical to stress response pathways. The study used data from 68 women collected from a convenience sample in 2013 from the Southside of Chicago. Comparing single, low-income Black mothers living in neighborhoods with high levels of violence (self-reported and assessed using administrative police records) to those with low levels of violence we found no significant differences in expression of 51 genes associated with the Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity (CTRA). Using TELiS analysis of promoter TF-binding motif prevalence we found that mothers who self-reported higher levels of neighborhood stress showed greater expression of genes regulated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). These findings may reflect increased cortisol output from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, or increased GR transcriptional sensitivity. Transcript origin analyses identified monocytes and dendritic cells as the primary cellular sources of gene transcripts up-regulated in association with neighborhood stress. The prominence of GR-related transcripts and the absence of sympathetic nervous system-related CTRA transcripts suggest that a subjective perception of elevated chronic neighborhood stress may be associated with an HPA-related defeat-withdrawal phenotype rather than a fight-or-flight phenotype. The defeat-withdrawal phenotype has been previously observed in animal models of severe, overwhelming threat. These results demonstrate the importance of studying biological embedding in diverse environments and communities, specifically marginalized populations such as low-income Black women.","D001741; D005260; D006801; D012111; D059467; D014754","Black or African American; Female; Humans; Residence Characteristics; Transcriptome; Violence","K01 HL149989; P30 AG017265","NA","Declarations of interest.

It is mandatory to understand the epilepsy's underlying etiology, whether it is structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune or (currently) unknown, as it contains major information about the clinical phenotype, cognitive comorbidities, (new) drug targets and also help to predict postsurgical outcome. A multimodal approach, including digital slides and multichannel immunofluorescence labelling can increase the diagnostic yield of subtle pathologies, while DNA methylation arrays could helps in the diagnosis of difficult-to-classify lesions. Such techniques are not always available, however, in low-income countries. Even without access to expensive molecular techniques, automated analysis scripts and machine learning algorithms can be developed by Latin American researchers to improve our diagnostic yield from routine Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin stained tissue sections. The pathology community of Latin America contributed substantially to our current knowledge of etiologies related to human epilepsies and experimental epilepsy models. To further boost the impact of Latin American research, local centers should adhere to modern, multimodal neuropathology techniques, integrate different levels of knowledge, and strengthen their scientific collaborations.

Evidence from many studies highlights that cognitive processes may be adversely affected by vulnerable contexts. The aim of this study was to determine if living in vulnerable conditions affects childhood cognitive development. To achieve this, we assessed the performance of a sample of 347 Guatemalan children and adolescents aged from 6 to 17 years (<i>M</i> = 10.8, <i>SD</i> = 3) in a series of 10 neuropsychological tasks recently standardized for the pediatric population of this country. Two-fifths of the sample (41.5%) could be considered to have vulnerable backgrounds, coming from families with low-socioeconomic status or having had a high exposure to violence. As expected, results showed lower scores in language and attention for the vulnerable group. However, contrary to expectations, consistent systematic differences were not found in the executive function tasks.

In particular, cash transfer programmes are currently being adapted or expanded in various low-income and middle-income countries to support individuals and families during the pandemic. We argue that the current crisis offers an opportunity for these programmes to focus on susceptible young people (aged 15-24 years), including those with mental health conditions. Young people living in poverty and with mental health problems are at particular risk of experiencing adverse health, wellbeing, and employment outcomes with long-term consequences. They are also at risk of developing mental health conditions during this pandemic. To support this population, cash transfer programmes should not only address urgent needs around food security and survival but expand their focus to address longer-term mental health impacts of pandemics and economic crises. Such an approach could help support young people's future life chances and break the vicious cycle between mental illness and poverty that spirals many young people into both socioeconomic and mental health disadvantage.","D000293; D000086382; D003906; D006078; D006801; D001523; D008603; D011203; D011632; D011640; D055815","Adolescent; COVID-19; Developing Countries; Government Programs; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Poverty; Public Assistance; Public Policy; Young Adult",NA,"10.1007/s00787-020-01505-8",NA,"Annette Bauer, Emily Garman, David McDaid, Mauricio Avendano, Philipp Hessel, Yadira D&#xed;az, Ricardo Araya, Crick Lund, Paulo Malvasi,  ..., Sara Evans-Lacko","Care Policy and Evaluation Centre, Department of Health Policy, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK."

There is a need to develop more feasible and evidence-based solutions through implementation research. This paper, one in a series pertaining to implementation in GMH projects worldwide, focuses on implementation factors influencing mental health service delivery. This is a qualitative study carried out as part of a Theory of Change-driven evaluation of Grand Challenges Canada's (GCC's) Global Mental Health portfolio. Purposive sampling was used to recruit twenty-nine GCC grantees for interviews. A semi-structured interview schedule was used to guide the interviews which were recorded and subsequently transcribed. Transcripts were double-coded and analyzed in NVivo 11 using framework analysis. This paper reports results related to detection and treatment of mental illness, mental health promotion and prevention of mental illness. Key barriers included: lack of appropriate human resources and expertise for service delivery; lack of culturally appropriate screening tools and interventions; and difficulties integrating services with the existing mental health system. Formative research was a key driver facilitating the cultural adaptation of mental health detection, treatment, promotion and preventative approaches. Recruiting local providers and utilizing mHealth for improving screening, monitoring and data management were also found to be successful approaches in reducing workforce burden, improving sustainability, mental health literacy, participant engagement and uptake. The study identifies a number of key barriers to and drivers of successful service delivery from the perspective of grantees implementing GMH projects. Findings highlight several opportunities to mitigate common challenges, providing recommendations for strengthening systems- and project-level approaches for delivering mental health services.

Research on the effects of poverty on children's development has been a focus of study for many decades and is now increasing as we accumulate more evidence about the implications of poverty. The American Academy of Pediatrics recently added ""Poverty and Child Health"" to its Agenda for Children to recognize what has now been established as broad and enduring effects of poverty on child development. A recent addition to the field has been the application of neuroscience-based methods. Various techniques including neuroimaging, neuroendocrinology, cognitive psychophysiology, and epigenetics are beginning to document ways in which early experiences of living in poverty affect infant brain development. We discuss whether there are truly worthwhile reasons for adding neuroscience and related biological methods to study child poverty, and how might these perspectives help guide developmentally based and targeted interventions and policies for these children and their families.","D002648; D005190; D005191; D006801; D007182; D007223; D011203; D012959; D014481","Child; Family; Family Characteristics; Humans; Income; Infant; Poverty; Socioeconomic Factors; United States","R01 MH061285; U54 HD090256","10.1093/aje/kwq483; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.05.062; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.15081014; 10.1080/00220380008422652; 10.1177/1745691610388779; 10.1177/0963721412469394; 10.1073/pnas.1708791114; 10.1016/j.acap.2016.01.010; 10.1542/peds.2012-2661; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2003.11.002; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2017.08.023; 10.3389/fnins.2014.00276; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.2988; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.07.019; 10.1111/spc3.12304; 10.1257/000282802762024520; 10.1093/qje/qjy007; 10.1257/aer.20150572; 10.1038/npp.2016.198; 10.1186/s12939-017-0670-3; 10.1073/pnas.1703444114; 10.18356/31de68d5-en; 10.1017/S0954579415001169; 10.3389/fnhum.2017.00547; 10.1002/wcs.1176; 10.1257/jep.27.2.109; 10.1016/j.dcn.2017.12.005; 10.1002/dev.21373; 10.1073/pnas.1604756114; 10.1257/pol.6.2.258; 10.1111/cdep.12013; 10.1177/0956797611434964; 10.1002/hbm.22553; 10.1038/s41583-018-0023-2; 10.1162/jocn_a_00750; 10.1111/desc.12450; 10.1111/nyas.13318; 10.1016/j.neuron.2014.10.047; 10.1073/pnas.1307893110; 10.1016/j.conb.2010.02.008; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.11.079; 10.1186/2045-5380-4-12; 10.1073/pnas.1909699116; 10.1038/nrn2897; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.1475; 10.1016/j.acap.2016.11.007; 10.1371/journal.pone.0018712; 10.1371/journal.pone.0080954; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.04.020; 10.1111/jcpp.12694; 10.1111/desc.12596; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.07.034; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.06.061; 10.1080/02724990444000113; 10.1073/pnas.1008950108; 10.1097/YCO.0000000000000178; 10.1016/j.cobeha.2018.01.016; 10.1177/1754073917693085; 10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00154; 10.1016/S2352-4642(17)30024-X; 10.1542/peds.2015-3075; 10.1016/j.bpsc.2016.04.005; 10.1016/j.nlm.2013.09.012; 10.3758/s13423-010-0048-7; 10.1073/pnas.1308240110; 10.1111/jcpp.12784; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e3182a151a7; 10.1111/desc.12096; 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00554; 10.1073/pnas.1518285112; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.3139; 10.1073/pnas.1902286116; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.1813; 10.1177/0956797615572233; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2012.07.012; 10.1146/annurev-vision-082114-035431; 10.1016/j.cognition.2007.07.017; 10.1016/B978-0-12-813146-6.00002-3; 10.1146/annurev-soc-060116-053252; 10.1016/j.neuron.2013.06.028; 10.1093/swr/svy007; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5501-05.2006; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0334-11.2011; 10.1080/15374416.2017.1326122; 10.3758/s13423-013-0391-6; 10.1177/0956797610370161; 10.1056/NEJMsa044316; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.02.025; 10.1002/hipo.22661; 10.1007/s10865-011-9382-0; 10.1016/j.jad.2019.04.088; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.01.080; 10.1038/nn.3983; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2011.06.019; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2018.02.002; 10.1017/S0954579418000123; 10.1016/j.comppsych.2018.12.012; 10.1038/s41598-017-17765-5; 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2017.05.004; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.12.031; 10.1111/desc.12946; 10.1111/cdev.12270; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0484-18.2018; 10.1080/10615806.2017.1330952; 10.1038/nn.4109; 10.1016/j.cognition.2013.08.009; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2011.03.003; 10.1016/j.acap.2015.11.005; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2012.65; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.10.002; 10.1177/1745691620920725; 10.1038/npp.2014.75; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.10.015; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.12.055; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.11.022; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0858-10.2010; 10.1371/journal.pone.0030148; 10.1007/7854_2016_42; 10.1016/j.brainres.2006.08.104; 10.1038/35083500; 10.1016/j.nbd.2011.01.020; 10.1162/jocn.2008.20040; 10.1016/j.bandl.2011.12.011; 10.1177/1745691612469029; 10.1038/oby.2011.168",NA,"Seth D Pollak, Barbara L Wolfe","Departments of Economics, Population Health Sciences and Public Affairs, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA."

To illustrate this approach, we focus on associations between poverty and brain function, the roles parents and neighborhoods play in this context, and the potential impact of developmental timing. We also describe the major challenges and needed advances in these areas of research to better understand how and why poverty-related adversity may impact the developing brain, including the need for: a population neuroscience approach with greater attention to sampling and representation, genetically informed and causal designs, advances in assessing context and brain function, caution in interpretation of effects, and a focus on resilience.

Since the 2008 global economic crisis, the pace of reduction in poverty and income inequality in the LAC region has stalled. The region is characterised by high levels of inequities and is also vulnerable to many natural disasters. Food systems are changing with increased availability and marketing of packaged and fast foods and sugar-sweetened drinks. Adolescence is a formative phase of the life course with multiple physical, emotional and social changes which can make them vulnerable to health problems. We assess the potential impact of macro-determinants, human and economic development as well as income inequality, on 2 top-ranking regional priorities for adolescent nutrition and mental health, using measures of overweight and suicidal ideation and planning which some have shown to be associated. The Global School-based Health Survey (GSHS) is a nationally representative self-administered, school-based survey. We examined overweight/obesity and suicidal ideation with planning by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita or human development index (HDI) in 10-19-year-old adolescents from 21 LAC countries between 2009 and 2013. Sample sizes varied from 943 in Anguilla to 27,988 in Argentina. A total of 55,295 adolescents had a measure of overweight/obesity status, and 59,061 adolescents reported about suicidal ideation with planning. There was equal representation by sex in the surveys (52% girls and 48% boys). A total of 28.8% of boys and 28.1% of girls had overweight/obesity, and 7.5% of boys and 17.5% of girls reported suicidal ideation with planning over the last 12 months. Adjusted for individual socioeconomic and risk behaviours, and relative to the highest GDP per capita tertile, the middle tertile was associated with 42% (95% confidence interval (CI) 59% to 17%, p = 0.003) and 32% (95% CI 60% to 5%, p = 0.023), and the lowest tertile with 40% (95% CI 55% to 19%, p = 0.001) and 46% (95% CI 59% to 29%, p &lt; 0.001) lower chances of overweight/obesity for girls and boys, respectively. A similar positive effect was seen with HDI, with lowest chances of overweight in the lowest tertile compared with the highest tertile for both sexes. Overweight/obesity was positively related with suicidal ideation with planning for girls (odds ratio (OR) 1.12, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.22, p = 0.009) and weakly related for boys (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.24, p = 0.182). In contrast to overweight/obesity status, suicidal ideation with planning was not related to macro-level indices despite both outcomes sharing common individual socioeconomic and risk behaviour correlates. Limitations include the dominance of Argentinians in the sample (40%), the exclusion of vulnerable adolescents who dropped out of school, and reporting bias due to stigma of mental health-related issues. This study shows that economic and human development were positively associated with adolescent overweight/obesity but not with suicidal ideation with planning. We also observed an interconnectedness between overweight/obesity and suicide ideation with planning among girls. These findings highlight the importance of strategies that engage with both upstream and downstream determinants to improve adolescent nutrition and mental health.","D000293; D000294; D000367; D017691; D002648; D002652; D003430; D005260; D006306; D006801; D007843; D008297; D008603; D063766; D018570; D012307; D012737; D059020; D055815","Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Age Factors; Caribbean Region; Child; Child Behavior; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Latin America; Male; Mental Health; Pediatric Obesity; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Suicidal Ideation; Young Adult","MR/R022739/1; MR/N015959/1","10.1016/j.jad.2018.05.028; 10.1186/2046-4053-4-4; 10.1176/ps.2010.61.3.218; 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32129-3; 10.1210/er.2010-0028; 10.1111/j.1753-4887.2011.00456.x; 10.1111/obr.12107; 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60741-8; 10.1038/s41574-020-00411-y; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60368-7; 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2008.10.013; 10.1038/mp.2013.54; 10.1111/sltb.12244; 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005867; 10.1177/0004867417717795; 10.1542/peds.2014-3549E; 10.2471/BLT.15.163295; 10.1007/s00038-018-1196-1; 10.1186/1475-2891-7-1; 10.1111/obr.12694; 10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031816-044604; 10.1016/S0140-6736(19)32497-3; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.08.036; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002968; 10.1038/sj.ijo.0802716; 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2012.01017.x; 10.2196/jmir.9044; 10.1037/ort0000294; 10.2105/AJPH.2007.120253; 10.1136/bmj.j1334; 10.3390/ijerph15071425; 10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32427-9; 10.1037/a0018697","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Christelle Elia, Alexis Karamanos, Alexandru Dregan, Majella O'Keeffe, Ingrid Wolfe, Jane Sandall, Craig Morgan, J Kennedy Cruickshank, Reeta Gobin,  ..., Seeromanie Harding","Department of Nutritional Sciences, School of Life Course Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences &amp; Medicine, King's College London, United Kingdom."

This review aims to support efforts to monitor progress in digital mental health research, ensuring new evidence can guide researchers, clinicians, policymakers and program managers positioned to adopt and implement these digitally-enabled treatments. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, an electronic database search from 2016 to 2020 yielded 37 digital intervention studies for detection, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and/or management of a broad range of mental disorders in 13 LMICs. This date range was selected to update previous reviews. Most studies involved online interventions and many reported feasibility and acceptability, reflected by participant satisfaction or program adherence. About half the studies (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;23) reported clinical benefits based on changes in mental health. For depression and mood disorders, some digital interventions showed improvements in depressive symptoms, quality of life, treatment adherence, and recovery. However, sample sizes were small and studies focused primarily on adults. Further limiting generalizability was the lack of consistency in clinical assessment and measurement tools between studies. No studies reported worsening symptoms, negative acceptability or dissatisfaction with digital interventions, suggesting possible publication bias. While digital interventions show promise, it remains difficult to conclude that digital interventions are effective from these studies, as it is prudent to exercise caution before drawing conclusions about clinical effectiveness.

Caries risk assessment (CRA) is a critical component of ECC management, yet the accuracy, consistency, reproducibility, and longitudinal validation of the available risk assessment techniques are lacking. Molecular and microbial biomarkers represent a potential source for accurate and reliable dental caries risk and onset. Next-generation nucleotide-sequencing technology has made it feasible to profile the composition of the oral microbiota. In the present study, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing was applied to saliva samples that were collected at 6-mo intervals for 24&#x2009;mo from a subset of 56 initially caries-free children from an ongoing cohort of 189 children, aged 1 to 3&#x2009;y, over the 2-y study period; 36 children developed ECC and 20 remained caries free. Analyses from machine learning models of microbiota composition, across the study period, distinguished between affected and nonaffected groups at the time of their initial study visits with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.71 and discriminated ECC-converted from healthy controls at the visit immediately preceding ECC diagnosis with an AUC of 0.89, as assessed by nested cross-validation. <i>Rothia mucilaginosa, Streptococcus</i> sp., and <i>Veillonella parvula</i> were selected as important discriminatory features in all models and represent biomarkers of risk for ECC onset. These findings indicate that oral microbiota as profiled by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing is predictive of ECC onset.","D002675; D003731; D003733; D006801; D064307; D008835; D011788; D012336; D015203; D014678","Child, Preschool; Dental Caries; Dental Caries Susceptibility; Humans; Microbiota; Micrococcaceae; Quality of Life; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Reproducibility of Results; Veillonella","R01 DE013683; R01 DE024985","NA","<b>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</b>The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.","A Grier, J A Myers, T G O'Connor, R G Quivey, S R Gill, D T Kopycka-Kedzierawski","Center for Oral Biology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA."

It is associated with many morbid maternal and fetal outcomes. Mood dysregulations (MDs, e.g., depression, distress, and anxiety) are common among women with GDM, and they exacerbate its prognosis and hinder its treatment. Hence, in addition to early detection and proper management of GDM, treating the associated MDs is crucial. Maternal hyperglycemia and MDs result from a complex network of genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors. This review briefly explores mechanisms that underlie GDM and prenatal MDs. It also describes the effect of exercise, dietary modification, and intermittent fasting (IF) on metabolic and affective dysfunctions exemplified by a case report. In this patient, interventions such as IF considerably reduced maternal body weight, plasma glucose, and psychological distress without any adverse effects. Thus, IF is one measure that can control GDM and maternal MDs; however, more investigations are warranted.","D001786; D001835; D016640; D015444; D005215; D005260; D006801; D011247; D011248","Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Diabetes, Gestational; Exercise; Fasting; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications",NA,"10.3390/ijms20246171; 10.1093/cdn/nzz055; 10.1080/0167482X.2019.1709816; 10.2337/dci18-0014; 10.1007/s00592-019-01304-x; 10.1155/2019/5320156; 10.3390/nu11071549; 10.2147/NSS.S226291; 10.1016/j.ssmph.2016.09.008; 10.1155/2017/4783791; 10.2174/1573399813666170502110559; 10.1080/14767058.2019.1678132; 10.4103/ejim.ejim_11_18; 10.21608/scumj.2019.65162; 10.11648/j.jfmhc.20170301.12; 10.1186/s13690-019-0362-0; 10.3390/ijms21114020; 10.1016/j.placenta.2020.05.006; 10.1007/s40618-017-0791-y; 10.1016/j.biochi.2018.07.007; 10.1007/s00592-018-1208-x; 10.3390/nu12020525; 10.1186/1868-7083-3-2; 10.1016/j.copsyc.2019.09.003; 10.1093/arclin/acw043.72; 10.1111/jog.14064; 10.3390/ijerph17145028; 10.1002/dev.21496; 10.2147/IJWH.S153273; 10.1186/s13011-019-0226-1; 10.1002/bdr2.1080; 10.1016/j.jad.2020.03.116; 10.1089/bfm.2019.0079; 10.33552/SJRR.2019.01.000509; 10.1007/s11011-020-00625-z; 10.2337/dc14-1530; 10.1186/s12884-019-2185-y; 10.19080/NAPDD.2018.04.555636; 10.2337/db16-0882; 10.3390/nu10060698; 10.1007/s00394-019-01970-1; 10.3390/nu11051003; 10.3390/ijerph17197053; 10.3390/medicina55050212; 10.3390/foods9101362; 10.1016/j.smhs.2020.11.006; 10.1136/bjsports-2014-093613; 10.1016/j.placenta.2018.01.002; 10.2337/db20-0471; 10.2337/db19-0909; 10.3390/antiox9100937; 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.10.034; 10.1111/nyas.14107; 10.1155/2020/1727142; 10.1111/joim.13021; 10.1002/dmrr.2617; 10.1016/j.biocel.2013.06.021; 10.3390/nu11020330; 10.1186/s13148-018-0567-z; 10.1007/s00223-017-0345-5; 10.3390/foods8100439; 10.1080/15548627.2017.1368596; 10.1155/2019/1703709; 10.1007/s12519-016-0077-z; 10.3390/ijms21030881; 10.1186/s13287-018-1118-4; 10.1152/physiolgenomics.00249.2004; 10.3389/fphys.2019.00996; 10.17219/acem/121524; 10.19813/j.cnki.weishengyanjiu.2020.02.002; 10.1002/da.22963; 10.1186/s13578-020-00388-1; 10.1016/j.midw.2019.102586; 10.1111/ijfs.14284; 10.2337/dc18-0102; 10.1080/14767058.2018.1526916; 10.1007/s11892-019-1208-4; 10.1037/bne0000368; 10.1093/ajcn/nqaa137; 10.1111/jcmm.13418; 10.3390/ijms20194662; 10.2478/amb-2020-0025; 10.1016/j.cell.2015.02.020; 10.2147/PPA.S244273; 10.3390/ijerph17114138; 10.1080/1028415X.2019.1676972; 10.1371/journal.pone.0237700; 10.1016/j.patbio.2014.10.003; 10.3390/nu12010197; 10.3390/nu12010087; 10.1093/jn/nxz047; 10.1186/1475-2891-5-35; 10.3389/fendo.2019.00296; 10.1080/14656566.2019.1622093; 10.1016/j.clnu.2015.04.020; 10.1136/gutjnl-2019-319654; 10.1039/C5FO00407A; 10.1016/j.dsx.2020.02.004; 10.1002/npr2.12079; 10.19080/JOJNHC.2018.09.555764; 10.1093/femsle/fnx285/4793248; 10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117910; 10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.08.100; 10.1007/s00394-020-02216-1; 10.1111/nyas.12355; 10.2337/dc13-0778; 10.1016/j.sleep.2017.08.010; 10.1111/head.13358; 10.33805/2765-8821.101; 10.3390/nu11061206","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","Amira Mohammed Ali, Hiroshi Kunugi","Department of Mental Disorder Research, National Institute of Neuroscience, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Tokyo 187-0031, Japan."

We hypothesised that this pattern is a function of relative deprivation whereby the severity of individual food insecurity relative to others in a reference group determines its associations with mental health and wellbeing after differences in absolute food insecurity are controlled for. Using survey data from the Gallup World Poll collected in 160 countries and a measure of relative deprivation (Yitzhaki index), we found that relative food insecurity-based on national or regional reference groups-related to more mental health symptoms, lower positive wellbeing and lower life satisfaction after controlling for absolute food insecurity, household income, and country differences. Our analysis also found that relative food insecurity was more strongly related to mental health and wellbeing where the prevalence of food insecurity was lower. The findings underscore the negative health consequences of material deprivation and unfavourable social comparisons. Consistent with relative deprivation theory, individuals who live with constant worries about not getting enough food, have to skip meals, or face chronic hunger are deprived of material and social resources that support mental health and wellbeing, especially in settings where food insecurity is less common and potentially more stigmatised. The implications of these findings for global food policy and surveillance efforts are discussed.","D001007; D000084884; D005523; D006801; D001523; D008603","Anxiety; Food Insecurity; Food Supply; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health","PJT-165971; PJT-162463","NA",NA,"Frank J Elgar, William Pickett, Timo-Kolja Pf&#xf6;rtner, Genevi&#xe8;ve Gari&#xe9;py, David Gordon, Kathy Georgiades, Colleen Davison, Nour Hammami, Allison H MacNeil,  ..., Hugo R Melgar-Qui&#xf1;onez","School of Human Nutrition, McGill University, 21111 Lakeshore Dr, Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, H9X 3L9, Canada."

In Uganda, the highest burden is among young rural people. We aimed to; (i) describe socio-economic status (including schooling), and household poverty in adolescents living with epilepsy (ALE) compared to unaffected counterparts in the same communities and (ii) determine the factors associated with the overall quality of life (QoL). This was a cross-sectional survey nested within a larger study of ALE compared to age-matched healthy community children in Uganda. Between Sept 2016 to Sept 2017, 154 ALE and 154 healthy community controls were consecutively recruited. Adolescents recruited were frequency and age-matched based on age categories 10-14 and 15-19&#x202f;years. Clinical history and standardized assessments were conducted. One control participant had incomplete assessment and was excluded. The primary outcome was overall QoL and key variables assessed were schooling status and household poverty. Descriptive and multivariable linear regression analysis were conducted for independent associations with overall QoL. Mean (SD) age at seizure onset was 8.8 (3.9) years and median (IQR) monthly seizure burden was 2 (1-4). Epilepsy was associated with living in homes with high household poverty; 95/154 (61.7%) ALE lived in the poorest homes compared to 68/153 (44.5%) of the healthy adolescents, p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.001. Nearly two-thirds of ALE had dropped out of school and only 48/154 (31.2%) were currently attending school compared to 136/153 (88.9%) of healthy controls, p&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;0.001. QoL was lowest among ALE who never attended school (p&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;0.001), with primary education (p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.006) compared to those with at least secondary education. Stigma scores [mean(SD)] were highest among ALE in the poorest [69.1(34.6)], and wealthy [70.2(32.2)] quintiles compared to their counterparts in poorer [61.8(31.7)], medium [68.0(32.7)] and wealthiest [61.5(33.3)] quintiles, though not statistically significant (p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.75). After adjusting for covariates, ALE currently attending school had higher overall QoL compared to their counterparts who never attended school (&#x3b2;&#x202f;=&#x202f;4.20, 95%CI: 0.90,7.49, p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.013).

ALE in this rural area are from the poorest households, are more likely to drop out of school and have the lowest QoL. Those with poorer seizure control are most affected. ALE should be included among vulnerable population groups and in addition to schooling, strategies for seizure control and addressing the epilepsy treatment gap in affected homes should be specifically targeted in state poverty eradication programs.","D000293; D002648; D003430; D004827; D006801; D011203; D011788; D014454","Adolescent; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Epilepsy; Humans; Poverty; Quality of Life; Uganda","203077; MR/M025489/1","NA","Declaration of Competing Interest All authors report no conflict of interest.","Ronald Anguzu, Pamela Akun, Thomas Katairo, Catherine Abbo, Albert Ningwa, Rodney Ogwang, Amos Deogratius Mwaka, Kevin Marsh, Charles R Newton, Richard Idro","Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda; Centre for Tropical Neuroscience, Kampala, Uganda; Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome Trust Collaborative Programme, Kilifi, Kenya; Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."

We find strong evidence in favour of specific probability density function choices: for example, the gamma distribution gives the best fit for onset-to-death and the generalized lognormal for onset-to-hospital-admission. Our results show that epidemiological distributions have considerable geographical variation, and provide the first estimates of these distributions in a low and middle-income setting.

However, this evidence has rarely been obtained in middle and low-income countries like Guatemala, where food insecurity and exposure to violence frequently threaten childhood development. The aim of this study was to analyse the relations that sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors have with psychological adjustment of low-socioeconomic status (SES) Guatemalan children and adolescents, and how these relations were mediated by food insecurity and exposure to violence. A total of 185 participants (50.8% girls; aged between 6 to 17, M = 11.82, SD = 3.7) from three vulnerable schools located in rural and urban areas of Guatemala were assessed. The results indicated that exposure to violence significantly moderates the effect of sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables in measures of depression, anxiety and health-related quality of life. Adolescents more exposed to violence reported higher levels of depression and anxiety, as well as lower levels of health-related quality of life. In contrast, food insecurity did not seem to influence psychological adjustment outcomes in this low-SES sample. These findings highlight the relevance of exposure to violence for mental health and well-being, and is a factor that should be considered when designing public health policies to promote children and adolescents' welfare.","D000293; D002648; D000069581; D005260; D006166; D006801; D008603; D011788; D012923","Adolescent; Child; Exposure to Violence; Female; Guatemala; Humans; Mental Health; Quality of Life; Social Class",NA,"10.1111/desc.12076; 10.2307/1131385; 10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.003; 10.1037/0003-066X.59.2.77; 10.1016/0147-1767(94)90036-1; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61238-0; 10.1017/S2045796015001158; 10.1093/inthealth/ihy081; 10.1136/ip.7.4.297; 10.1590/S0104-11692013000200016; 10.1016/j.semerg.2019.02.007; 10.1073/pnas.1604756114; 10.1093/scan/nsv045; 10.1016/S0006-3223(01)01129-5; 10.1007/s10802-017-0370-x; 10.1111/j.1467-9450.2010.00859.x; 10.1186/s12888-019-2380-4; 10.1016/j.jad.2008.12.008; 10.18203/2394-6040.ijcmph20170763; 10.1016/j.chc.2012.05.001; 10.1016/j.rpsm.2012.01.005; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2018.10.302; 10.1016/j.jaac.2012.09.009; 10.3945/jn.116.232298; 10.1016/j.pedn.2019.11.001; 10.1080/13548506.2016.1274411; 10.1590/S1020-49892012000500009; 10.1186/s12889-017-4348-y; 10.1016/j.ypmed.2012.12.018; 10.2471/BLT.08-060061; 10.1007/BF03404503; 10.1007/s12519-018-0158-2; 10.1186/s12955-016-0558-8; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2016.05.001; 10.1016/j.adolescence.2013.03.006; 10.1007/s11136-018-1881-9; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.04.013; 10.1007/s12187-013-9183-9; 10.3233/NRE-172275; 10.1037/h0087690; 10.1007/s11136-010-9706-5; 10.1016/S0005-7967(99)00130-8; 10.1016/j.jad.2017.04.022; 10.5944/rppc.vol.15.num.3.2010.4095; 10.5694/mja12.10628; 10.1016/j.jaac.2010.05.017; 10.1037/0278-6133.21.3.254; 10.3109/01612840903200027; 10.1037/a0039501; 10.1111/j.1365-2850.2008.01321.x; 10.1023/A:1027386430859; 10.1006/jado.1998.0198; 10.1016/S1054-139X(02)00404-4; 10.1111/j.1939-0025.2011.01135.x; 10.1017/S0954579498001539; 10.5093/in2011v20n2a2; 10.1023/B:CCFP.0000006293.77143.e1; 10.1037/gpr0000005","The authors declare no conflict of interest.

The objective of this review is to synthesise findings on the effectiveness of MMH interventions to improve child-related outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We searched for randomised controlled trials conducted in LMICs evaluating interventions with a MMH component and reporting children's outcomes. Meta-analysis was performed on outcomes included in at least two trials. We identified 21 trials with 28 284 mother-child dyads. Most trials were conducted in middle-income countries, evaluating home visiting interventions delivered by general health workers, starting in the third trimester of pregnancy. Only ten trials described acceptable methods for blinding outcome assessors. Four trials showed high risk of bias in at least two of the seven domains assessed in this review. Narrative synthesis showed promising but inconclusive findings for child-related outcomes. Meta-analysis identified a sizeable impact of interventions on exclusive breastfeeding (risk ratio = 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-1.71, ten trials, N = 4749 mother-child dyads, I2 = 61%) and a small effect on child height-for-age at 6-months (std. mean difference = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.02-0.24, three trials, N = 1388, I2 = 0%). Meta-analyses did not identify intervention benefits for child cognitive and other growth outcomes; however, few trials measured these outcomes. These findings support the importance of MMH to improve child-related outcomes in LMICs, particularly exclusive breastfeeding. Given, the small number of trials and methodological limitations, more rigorous trials should be conducted.","D001942; D002648; D016241; D003906; D005260; D006801; D008297; D000068097; D001523; D008603; D009034; D009769; D011203","Breast Feeding; Child; Child of Impaired Parents; Developing Countries; Female; Humans; Male; Maternal Health; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Mother-Child Relations; Object Attachment; Poverty",NA,"NA","Funding for the study described in this article was provided by Action contre La Faim.

Globally, there is a need to better understand risk factors for adolescent depression to inform policies for effective prevention initiatives. A Delphi consensus study was conducted on risk factors, early signs, and detection strategies for adolescent depression in global settings. Over 3 survey rounds, global experts formulated and ranked these variables for (1) specificity for adolescent depression and (2) feasibility of measurement (round 1, n=21 participants; rounds 2 and 3, n=17). We calculated Smith's salience index as a measure of consensus. Interviews were conducted with 10 participants to elicit qualitative reflections on the ranking results, and on the influence of cultural and contextual factors on depression risks. Thirty-one risk factors for adolescent depression were generated. Panelists ranked three as highly specific and highly feasible to measure: family history of depression, exposure to bullying, and a negative family environment. Six were ranked as modestly specific and highly feasible: physical illness or disability, female sex, bereavement, trauma exposure, substance abuse, and low self-esteem. An additional 5 items were modestly specific and modestly feasible: social difficulties, academic stress, poverty, loss of family, and cognitive distortions. Five symptoms were at least modestly specific and feasible to measure: mood changes, loss of interest, social isolation, suicidality, and sleep changes. Schools were considered the most feasible place for screening. The participants were not representative of all countries and cultural regions.

We assessed whether the presence of a neighborhood park is associated with pediatric physical or mental health across the U.S. using a nationally representative cross-sectional random sample of American children ages 0-17. Caregivers reported on the park presence in their child's neighborhood and the child's physical activity, screen-time, sleep, weight, and diagnosis of anxiety, depression, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Covariates included child and family sociodemographics and, for 29 states, neighborhood urbanicity. Caregivers reported on 49,146 children (mean age 9.4&#xa0;years; 49% female). There were 11,791 (24%) children living in neighborhoods lacking a park; children in non-urban locations (aOR 2.19, 95% CI 1.40-1.67) or below the federal poverty level (aOR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.48, 95%CI 1.38-1.58) had higher odds of lacking a park. Irrespective of sociodemographics, children lacking parks were more likely to be physically inactive (aOR1.36, 95% CI 1.24, 1.48), have excessive screen-time (aOR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.19, 95% CI 1.14, 1.25), or obtain inadequate sleep (aOR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.23, 95% CI 1.18, 1.29).

Thirty percent of children in the lowest-income neighborhoods were vulnerable in one or more domains of health development, compared with 17&#xa0;percent of children in higher-income settings. Significantly higher rates of income-related Early Development Instrument vulnerability-defined as children falling below the tenth-percentile cutoff on any Early Development Instrument domain-were demonstrated for Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx children. These findings underscore the utility of the Early Development Instrument as a way for communities to measure child health equity gaps and inform the design, implementation, and performance of multisector place-based child health initiatives.

An enduring question, however, is whether these associations are causal. Genetic confounding could occur due to downward mobility of individuals at high genetic risk for psychiatric problems into disadvantaged environments. We examined correlations of five indices of genetic risk [polygenic risk scores (PRS) for schizophrenia and depression, maternal psychotic symptoms, family psychiatric history, and zygosity-based latent genetic risk] with multiple area-, neighborhood-, and family-level risks during upbringing. Data were from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally-representative cohort of 2232 British twins born in 1994-1995 and followed to age 18 (93% retention). Socioenvironmental risks included urbanicity, air pollution, neighborhood deprivation, neighborhood crime, neighborhood disorder, social cohesion, residential mobility, family poverty, and a cumulative environmental risk scale. At age 18, participants were privately interviewed about psychotic experiences. Higher genetic risk on all indices was associated with riskier environments during upbringing. For example, participants with higher schizophrenia PRS (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.06-1.33), depression PRS (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.08-1.34), family history (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.11-1.40), and latent genetic risk (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.07-1.38) had accumulated more socioenvironmental risks for schizophrenia by age 18. However, associations between socioenvironmental risks and psychotic experiences mostly remained significant after covariate adjustment for genetic risk. Genetic risk is correlated with socioenvironmental risk for schizophrenia during upbringing, but the associations between socioenvironmental risk and adolescent psychotic experiences appear, at present, to exist above and beyond this gene-environment correlation.","D000293; D006801; D008137; D011618; D012111; D012559; D012931; D006113","Adolescent; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Psychotic Disorders; Residence Characteristics; Schizophrenia; Social Environment; United Kingdom","G1002190; MR/P005918/1; NE/P010687/1; 204823/Z/16/Z; 218632/Z/19/Z","10.1016/j.neubiorev.2018.06.002; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10040567; 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.05.034; 10.1038/s41562-019-0562-1; 10.1016/j.schres.2014.03.014; 10.1037/a0023194; 10.1111/1467-9280.00267; 10.1186/s13742-015-0047-8; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.1581; 10.1038/nature16030; 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003348; 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu848; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2017.02.492; 10.1038/nature15393; 10.1176/ajp.155.9.1196; 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.14401; 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62036-X; 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000529; 10.1093/schbul/sbs151; 10.1038/nature10190; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.2508; 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60072-6; 10.1016/j.schres.2011.03.029; 10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.03.004; 10.1017/S0033291708003115; 10.1111/1469-7610.00082; 10.1056/nejm199902253400803; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.0056; 10.1017/S0954579417001420; 10.1093/schbul/sbw052; 10.1093/schbul/sbx060; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2012.02565.x; 10.1017/S0954579412000326; 10.1037/a0016162; 10.1007/s00127-016-1233-4; 10.1002/ajmg.b.32630; 10.1017/S0033291717001696; 10.1038/s41588-018-0059-2; 10.1192/bjp.179.1.46; 10.1001/archpsyc.58.11.1039; 10.1038/nrg2670; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.14; 10.1001/archpsyc.57.11.1053; 10.1038/nature13595; 10.1038/tp.2016.62; 10.1093/nar/29.1.308; 10.1093/schbul/sbz049; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2004.04.003; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2006.00857.x; 10.1017/S0033291708003814; 10.1093/schbul/sbn101; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2016.06.028; 10.1093/schbul/sbs096; 10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.06.005; 10.1038/s41588-018-0090-3; 10.1038/ejhg.2009.177; 10.1097/01.chi.0000126937.44875.6b; 10.1080/00048670802607188","None.","J B Newbury, L Arseneault, A Caspi, T E Moffitt, C L Odgers, D W Belsky, K Sugden, B Williams, A P Ambler,  ..., H L Fisher","King's College London, Social, Genetic &amp; Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience, London, UK."

Trajectories of development increasingly appear best accounted for by a complex, dynamic interchange among the highly linked elements of genes, contexts, and time at multiple scales, including neurobiological (minutes to milliseconds), genomic (hours to minutes), developmental (years and months), and evolutionary (centuries and millennia) time. This special issue of PNAS thus explores time and timing among G-E transactions: The importance of timing and timescales in plasticity and critical periods of brain development; epigenetics and the molecular underpinnings of biologically embedded experience; the encoding of experience across time and biological levels of organization; and gene-regulatory networks in behavior and development and their linkages to neuronal networks. Taken together, the collection of papers offers perspectives on how G-E interplay operates contingently within and against a backdrop of time and timescales.","D000818; D005075; D044127; D005786; D059647; D006801; D013995","Animals; Biological Evolution; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene-Environment Interaction; Humans; Time",NA,"NA","The authors declare no competing interest.","W Thomas Boyce, Marla B Sokolowski, Gene E Robinson","Program in Child and Brain Development, Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, Toronto, ON M5G 1M1, Canada."

This study aims to unravel changes in household poverty levels among people with SMI in a fast-changing rural community in China. Two mental health surveys, using ICD-10, were conducted in the same six townships of Xinjin county, Chengdu, China. A total of 711 and 1042 people with SMI identified in 1994 and 2015, respectively, participated in the study. The Foster-Greer-Thorbecke poverty index was adopted to measure the changes in household poverty. These changes were decomposed into effects of growth and equity using a static decomposition method. Factors associated with household poverty in 1994 and 2015 were examined and compared by regression analyses. The proportion of poor households, as measured by the headcount ratio, increased significantly from 29.8% in 1994 to 39.5% in 2015. Decomposition showed that poverty in households containing people with SMI had worsened because of a redistribution effect. Factors associated with household poverty had also changed during the study period. The patient's age, ability to work and family size were of paramount significance in 2015. This study shows that the levels of poverty faced by households containing people with SMI has become more pressing with China's fast socioeconomic development. It calls for further integration of mental health recovery and targeted antipoverty interventions for people with SMI as a development priority.",NA,NA,"MR/R023697/1","NA","None.

Originally used for cultural, medicinal, and ceremonial purposes mainly in South Asian countries, its use has recently spread across the globe due to its psychoactive, euphoric, and aphrodisiac properties. Now it is widely used as a social lubricant and source of financial profit. Unfortunately, the profit motive has led to high rates of habitual consumption with eventual conversion to addiction among young girls and boys. Moreover, the worrisome practice of including tobacco in quid preparations has grown, particularly among pregnant women. Major health concerns include increased rates of malignancy, oral pathology, and cardiovascular, hepatic, fertility, metabolic, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Metabolic disorders and insulin resistance disease states such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome contribute to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, the constituents of areca nut/betel quid are metabolized to N-nitroso compounds, i.e., nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic at high doses and cause insulin resistance following chronic low-level exposures. From an epidemiological perspective, the rising tide of insulin resistance diseases including obesity, diabetes, and dementias that now disproportionately burden poor countries has been propagated by rapid commercialization and enhanced access to betel quid. Public health measures are needed to impose socially and ethically responsible barriers to yet another cause of global health disparity.","D001114; D044466; D003924; D054242; D005260; D054624; D006801; D007333; D008297; D011203; D011247; D055815","Areca; Asian People; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Male; Poverty; Pregnancy; Young Adult","R01 AA011431; R01 AA028408; R37 11431","10.1016/j.pcad.2015.08.010; 10.3233/JAD-2009-1098; 10.1007/s13105-016-0465-9; 10.1007/BF02860022; 10.1016/S0190-9622(98)70543-2; 10.1080/13556210020091437; 10.1080/13556210120091446; 10.1080/13556210120091473; 10.1080/13556210120091509; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.02952.x; 10.1016/j.jep.2015.02.010; 10.1016/0006-8993(77)90075-0; 10.1002/hed.23130; 10.1097/WNR.0000000000001172; 10.1046/j.1440-1754.2002.00040.x; 10.1590/S0042-96862005000900010; 10.3758/s13414-011-0214-7; 10.1016/S0009-9236(96)90054-5; 10.1001/archpsyc.1988.01800340023003; 10.1006/nlme.1997.3786; 10.1192/bjp.138.1.46; 10.1006/nlme.1995.1017; 10.1016/0893-133X(95)00179-H; 10.1007/BF02244889; 10.1007/s00213-016-4331-9; 10.1371/journal.pone.0023874; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.06.039; 10.1080/01635589409514333; 10.1038/bjc.1984.210; 10.1046/j.1440-1843.2003.00507.x; 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000201)88:3&lt;664::AID-CNCR25&gt;3.0.CO;2-V; 10.1111/j.1600-0722.1980.tb01221.x; 10.1080/13556210120091518; 10.1080/13556210120091536; 10.1016/S1470-2045(03)01229-4; 10.4103/1947-2714.163648; 10.1021/acs.jafc.6b05140; 10.4103/0976-237X.96817; 10.1136/bmj.324.7341.799; 10.1186/1617-9625-1-2-111; 10.4103/0970-9290.30915; 10.1111/j.1600-0714.1996.tb00209.x; 10.1300/J500v04n01_07; 10.1007/s10903-007-9041-2; 10.1006/pmed.1999.0560; 10.2427/5709; 10.1080/10826084.2016.1246572; 10.2190/DE.39.1.e; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2010.07.018; 10.1177/2229411220140205; 10.1016/j.jobcr.2016.10.008; 10.1186/s12889-017-4916-1; 10.1111/j.1600-0528.1993.tb01101.x; 10.1034/j.1600-0528.2000.028002150.x; 10.1080/13556210050003766; 10.1186/1747-597X-6-23; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.03.016; 10.5005/jp-journals-10001-1003; 10.1080/13556210120091482; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.05.020; 10.1291/hypres.31.417; 10.1093/ajcn/87.1.70; 10.4103/0971-5851.133702; 10.1177/1403494810379291; 10.1007/s00127-017-1460-3; 10.1136/adc.88.12.1086; 10.1016/S0892-0362(00)00096-9; 10.1136/thx.53.5.381; 10.1136/thx.53.4.295; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2009.06.021; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.01.003; 10.1016/j.medcli.2018.03.022; 10.1016/j.inhe.2012.05.001; 10.1186/s12884-015-0615-z; 10.1007/s10995-016-1972-6; 10.1080/13556210120091455; 10.1016/0306-3623(93)90224-L; 10.1016/0022-510X(90)90099-9; 10.1139/Y10-024; 10.1038/258627a0; 10.1111/j.1600-0714.2009.00881.x; 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-0483; 10.1002/rcm.3137; 10.1021/tx0600402; 10.1002/dta.1912; 10.1093/jat/bkv077; 10.15713/ins.jcri.153; 10.1002/1097-0142(19920901)70:5&lt;1017::AID-CNCR2820700502&gt;3.0.CO;2-#; 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(20000401)86:1&lt;128::AID-IJC20&gt;3.0.CO;2-M; 10.1054/bjoc.2001.1927; 10.1111/j.1600-0714.2006.00431.x; 10.1093/jat/21.4.310; 10.1111/j.1651-2227.1990.tb11430.x; 10.1038/383713a0; 10.1254/jphs.14R03CP; 10.3109/00498259409043240; 10.1073/pnas.220207697; 10.1093/carcin/9.6.875; 10.1093/carcin/12.2.299; 10.1007/BF01830261; 10.1002/jcb.240531005; 10.1186/1476-9255-9-22; 10.1097/MAJ.0b013e31827333fb; 10.5005/jp-journals-10024-1922; 10.7314/APJCP.2015.16.10.4429; 10.1046/j.1365-263x.2001.00235.x; 10.4066/AMJ.2010.280; 10.1007/BF00428777; 10.1080/13556210120091464; 10.1093/ajcn/83.6.1313; 10.1007/s10565-011-9195-5; 10.1002/jmri.25322; 10.1097/MAJ.0b013e31823650a7; 10.1080/00016350802286725; 10.1017/S0007114500000349; 10.1007/s00125-004-1532-2; 10.1371/journal.pone.0070679; 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.021511; 10.1093/ajcn/83.5.1153; 10.1155/2013/409083; 10.1038/oby.2009.38; 10.1080/13813455.2017.1420665; 10.1038/nrneurol.2017.185; 10.2174/1568026617666170103163403; 10.1590/1980-57642015DN92000003; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2006.03.003; 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2014.06.008; 10.1016/j.ecl.2013.09.006; 10.1016/j.esxm.2017.05.002; 10.1186/s12967-016-0784-1; 10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00139; 10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00201; 10.3109/13880209.2016.1160251; 10.1093/carcin/22.9.1527; 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2010.07.017; 10.1002/bdra.10136; 10.4196/kjpp.2014.18.2.143; 10.1002/ijc.2910470315; 10.21010/ajtcam.v14i3.4; 10.4103/0973-029X.125203; 10.1007/s007840000077; 10.1177/154411130201300208; 10.1046/j.1365-2842.2000.00578.x; 10.1186/1475-2891-11-79; 10.5005/johcd-8-2-79","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","Suzanne M de la Monte, Natalia Moriel, Amy Lin, Nada Abdullah Tanoukhy, Camille Homans, Gina Gallucci, Ming Tong, Ayumi Saito","Department of Epidemiology in the School of Public Health, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, USA."

This was an exploratory study which sought to examine low-income women's perceptions of mental illness and its management in the context of urban poverty in India. This research was prompted by the lack of empirical studies documenting how women in marginalized sections of society understand mental illness. Data were collected through a combination of 10 focus group discussions and two individual interviews with a total of 63 women residing in low-income areas of Mumbai. Social representations theory was used to explore shared meanings of mental illness among women in this setting. Thematic analysis of the data showed that women use the expression ""tension"" to talk about mental illness. Tension was described both as an ordinary part of life and a condition having its origins in more profound gender-related stressors, particularly pressures surrounding motherhood, chronic poverty and domestic conflict. Approaches to managing tension were pluralistic and focused on the resumption of social roles. Findings are consistent with other studies in similar cultural contexts, suggesting a shared, transnational character to women's distress and the need for scholarship on women's mental health in low-income settings to be more attuned to gendered forms of marginalization.","D005260; D006801; D007194; D001523; D008603; D011203; D016387","Female; Humans; India; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Poverty; Women's Health",NA,"NA","<b>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</b> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect tothe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.","Saloni Atal, Juliet Foster","Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London."

The goal of this study is to report the associations of COVID-19 with respect to race, health, and economic inequality in the United States. We performed an ecological study of the associations between infection and mortality rate of COVID-19 and demographic, socioeconomic, and mobility variables from 369 counties (total population, 102,178,117 [median, 73,447; IQR, 30,761-256,098]) from the seven most affected states (Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Louisiana, Massachusetts). The risk factors for infection and mortality are different. Our analysis shows that counties with more diverse demographics, higher population, education, income levels, and lower disability rates were at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. However, counties with higher proportion with disability and poverty rates had a higher death rate. African Americans were more vulnerable to COVID-19 than other ethnic groups (1981 African American infected cases versus 658 Whites per million). Data on mobility changes corroborate the impact of social distancing. Our study provides evidence of racial, economic, and health inequality in the population infected by and dying from COVID-19. These observations might be due to the workforce of essential services, poverty, and access to care. Counties in more urban areas are probably better equipped at providing care. The lower rate of infection, but a higher death rate in counties with higher poverty and disability could be due to lower levels of mobility, but a higher rate of comorbidities and health care access.","D000086382; D005260; D054624; D006801; D008297; D044469; D012307; D012959; D014481","COVID-19; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Male; Racial Groups; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; United States","R56 HL116832; R56HL116832","10.7861/clinmed.2019-coron; 10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102433; 10.2105/AJPH.2009.188029; 10.5455/msm.2015.27.409-411; 10.1186/s12913-015-1053-3; 10.1016/j.jpubeco.2018.06.011; 10.1016/j.dhjo.2010.05.003; 10.1016/j.phr.2004.05.006; 10.1177/1367493510387951; 10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.10.083; 10.1016/j.puhe.2018.01.030; 10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.03.054; 10.1007/s40615-016-0335-8","The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.","Vida Abedi, Oluwaseyi Olulana, Venkatesh Avula, Durgesh Chaudhary, Ayesha Khan, Shima Shahjouei, Jiang Li, Ramin Zand","Geisinger Neuroscience Institute, Geisinger Health System, Danville, PA, USA."

In the present work we assessed sociodemographic variables, psychiatric parameters and thiamine and its derivative in the whole blood of women in a rural, low-income community in Brazil. A case-control study was done. 94 women were divided in groups using the trimesters of pregnancy as a criterion: each trimester, 1st, 2nd and 3rd had 17, 37 and 38 women, respectively. A control group of non-pregnant women (n-39) was also included. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed using the HAMA Scale and Beck Inventory, respectively. The thiamine and its phosphorylated derivatives concentrations were determined in whole blood samples using the HPLC method. The results suggest that physiological mechanisms linked to the metabolic pathways of thiamine may play a role in some neurobiological substrate involved in the regulation of emotional state. Thus, social vulnerability is identified as an important factor to be considered in the evaluation of the mental health of pregnant women living in rural communities.","D000293; D000328; D001938; D016022; D005260; D006801; D001523; D011203; D011247; D011248; D037841; D012424; D013832; D035862; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Brazil; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Mental Disorders; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnant Women; Rural Population; Thiamine Deficiency; Vulnerable Populations; Young Adult",NA,"NA",NA,"Fernando Machado Vilhena Dias, Aline Sanches Oliveira, Cl&#xe1;udio S Dias J&#xfa;nior, Glaura C Franco, Ant&#xf4;nio L Teixeira, Poliana Toledo Nunes, Patricia da Silva Oliveira, Angela Maria Ribeiro","Graduate program in Neurosciences, Laboratorio of Molecular and Behavioural Neuroscience, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil."

However, how they affect the brain in patients with psychosis remains unclear. We studied how environmental factors are related to brain structure in patients with schizophrenia and controls in Latin America, where these factors are large and unequally distributed. This is a multicentre study of magnetic resonance imaging in patients with schizophrenia and controls from six Latin American cities. Total and voxel-level grey matter volumes, and their relationship with neighbourhood characteristics such as average income and homicide rates, were analysed with a general linear model. A total of 334 patients with schizophrenia and 262 controls were included. Income was differentially related to total grey matter volume in both groups (P = 0.006). Controls showed a positive correlation between total grey matter volume and income (R = 0.14, P = 0.02). Surprisingly, this relationship was not present in patients with schizophrenia (R = -0.076, P = 0.17). Voxel-level analysis confirmed that this interaction was widespread across the cortex. After adjusting for global brain changes, income was positively related to prefrontal cortex volumes only in controls. Conversely, the hippocampus in patients with schizophrenia, but not in controls, was relatively larger in affluent environments. There was no significant correlation between environmental violence and brain structure. Our results highlight the interplay between environment, particularly poverty, and individual characteristics in psychosis. This is particularly important for harsh environments such as low- and middle-income countries, where potentially less brain vulnerability (less grey matter loss) is sufficient to become unwell in adverse (poor) environments.","D001921; D002947; D066128; D006801; D007843; D008279; D011203; D012559; D014754","Brain; Cities; Gray Matter; Humans; Latin America; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Poverty; Schizophrenia; Violence",NA,"NA",NA,"Nicolas A Crossley, Andre Zugman, Francisco Reyes-Madrigal, Leticia S Czepielewski, Mariana N Castro, Ana M Diaz-Zuluaga, Julian A Pineda-Zapata, Ramiro Reckziegel,  ..., Ary Gadelha","LiNC, Department of Psychiatry, Universidade Federal de S&#xe3;o Paulo, Brazil."

The disease is a serious public health problem, and is directly linked to social issues. We analyzed temporal trend variations in areas at risk for concomitant TB, and characterized the clinical and epidemiological profiles of cases in a hyperendemic municipality in the Amazon region of Brazil. This ecological study was performed in the municipality of Manaus, in northern Brazil. The population comprised cases with concomitant pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB, registered on the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN), between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2018. For risk cluster detection, spatial and spatiotemporal scanning statistical techniques were used. The Spatial Variation in Temporal Trends (SVTT) approach was used to detect and infer clusters for significantly different time trends. Between 2009 and 2018, 873 concomitant TB cases were registered in Manaus. By using purely spatial scanning statistics, we identified two risk clusters. The relative risk (RR) of the clusters was 2.21 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.57-2.88; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0031) and 2.03 (95% CI: 1.58-2.58; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0029).

Negative cognitive schemas are associated with both CA exposure and psychotic symptoms, highlighting the possibility that cognitive schemas may be a key risk pathway. The purpose of this study was to determine whether negative cognitive schemas mediate the association between CA and specific attenuated psychotic symptoms in a large sample of clinical-high risk youth. Given the variability in experiences that encompass CA (eg, abuse, neglect and poverty) and attenuated psychotic symptoms (eg, suspiciousness and perceptual abnormalities), we also tested whether these associations differ by CA type (threat vs deprivation) and attenuated positive psychotic symptom domain. Data were collected from 531 clinical-high risk youth between 12 and 35&#x2009;years of age (mean&#xa0;=&#xa0;18.80, SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;4.21) who completed a clinical assessment that included the Structured Interview of Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS), Childhood Trauma and Abuse scale and questionnaires on cognitive schemas and depressive symptoms. No direct effects of threat or deprivation exposure on any of the psychotic symptom domains were found. However, there was a unique indirect effect of threat, but not deprivation, on delusional thinking and suspiciousness through negative cognitive schemas about others. Cognitive vulnerability in the form of negative schemas about others may be one mechanism linking childhood threat experiences and attenuated psychotic symptoms. The results underscore the importance of targeting negative schemas in interventions to mitigate psychosis risk.","D000293; D000076783; D002648; D002649; D003071; D006801; D062706; D011618","Adolescent; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Child; Child Abuse; Cognition; Humans; Prodromal Symptoms; Psychotic Disorders","U01 MH082004","NA",NA,"Allison M LoPilato, Yinghao Zhang, Madeline Pike, Jean Addington, Carrie E Bearden, Kristin S Cadenhead, Tyrone D Cannon, Barbara A Cornblatt, Daniel H Mathalon,  ..., Elaine F Walker","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Emory School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."

We aimed to estimate the treated incidence of NAPD in Chile, and variance by person, place and time. We used national register data from Chile including all people, 10-65 years, with the first episode of NAPD (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision: F20-F29) between 1 January 2005 and 29 August 2018. Denominators were estimated from Chilean National Census data. Our main outcome was treated incidence of NAPD and age group, sex, calendar year and regional-level population density, multidimensional poverty and latitude were exposures of interest. We identified 32 358 NAPD cases [12 136 (39.5%) women; median age-at-first-contact: 24 years (interquartile range 18-39 years)] during 171.1 million person-years [crude incidence: 18.9 per 100 000 person-years; 95% confidence interval (CI) 18.7-19.1]. Multilevel Poisson regression identified a strong age-sex interaction in incidence, with rates peaking in men (57.6 per 100 000 person-years; 95% CI 56.0-59.2) and women (29.5 per 100 000 person-years; 95% CI 28.4-30.7) between 15 and 19 years old. Rates also decreased (non-linearly) over time for women, but not men. We observed a non-linear association with multidimensional poverty and latitude, with the highest rates in the poorest regions and those immediately south of Santiago; no association with regional population density was observed. Our findings inform the aetiology of NAPDs, replicating typical associations with age, sex and multidimensional poverty in a Global South context.

Results indicated that blunted HPA reactivity to a laboratory social stress task mediated the association between emotional abuse and youth internalizing symptoms. Emotional abuse was also associated with blunted parasympathetic nervous system activity (i.e. less vagal withdrawal than average). In sum, emotional abuse is a potent risk factor for youth internalizing symptoms, and this link may be mediated via dysregulation in physiological stress response systems. Primary prevention of childhood emotional abuse and secondary prevention programs that target self-regulation skills may reduce rates of youth internalizing symptoms and disorders.","D001007; D002648; D002649; D003863; D000085202; D005260; D006801; D007030; D008137; D008297; D000081983; D010275; D010913; D011203; D011446; D012307; D013312; D013315; D013564","Anxiety; Child; Child Abuse; Depression; Emotional Abuse; Female; Humans; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mediation Analysis; Parasympathetic Nervous System; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Poverty; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Stress, Physiological; Stress, Psychological; Sympathetic Nervous System","K01 DA045219; T32 MH020061; UL1 TR002378","10.1007/s10608-015-9735-z; 10.1017/S0954579410000520; 10.1037/a0023151; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2003.09.023; 10.1177/1077559599004001005; 10.1007/s10802-016-0150-z; 10.1080/15374416.2013.777916; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2008.12.007; 10.1007/s10964-006-9057-2; 10.1017/S0954579411000289; 10.1146/annurev-psych-122414-033259; 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00608.x; 10.1037/0022-006X.70.1.6; 10.1097/00004703-200204000-00007; 10.1017/S0954579412000053; 10.1017/S0954579416000638; 10.1146/annurev.psych.58.110405.085605; 10.1037/1089-2680.10.3.229; 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2006.06.010; 10.1038/nri3042; 10.1111/j.1540-5834.2011.00665.x; 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00213; 10.1073/pnas.1423363112; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2008.08.013; 10.1016/j.cpr.2016.09.003; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.00418.x; 10.1080/15374416.2013.848774; 10.1038/s41398-017-0032-3; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2008.03.008; 10.1016/S0896-6273(02)00653-0; 10.1007/s10567-011-0084-5; 10.1111/jcpp.12784; 10.1017/S0954579418000044; 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2015.08.004; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2013.04.011; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2011.05.009; 10.1007/s10802-007-9127-2; 10.1017/S0954579410000672; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.03.021; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.11.005; 10.1016/S0301-0511(96)05197-6; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.04.028; 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000369; 10.1111/j.1469-8986.1997.tb02140.x; 10.1017/S0048577299981003; 10.1017/S0954579417000669; 10.1007/s40653-019-00291-z; 10.1176/ajp.143.8.1024; 10.1007/BF01537962; 10.1080/10705519909540118; 10.1186/s12874-018-0473-2; 10.1207/s15328007sem0803_5; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2008.12.005; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2016.11.024; 10.3389/fpsyt.2015.00042; 10.1016/S0145-2134(02)00342-3; 10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.25; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.05.007.Early; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.11.007; 10.1017/S0954579416000985; 10.1037/hea0000852; 10.1017/S0954579413000667; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.06.017; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2010.07.006; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2010.10.014; 10.1002/1097-0355(200101/04)22:1&lt;67::AID-IMHJ3&gt;3.0.CO;2-G; 10.1080/02791072.2010.10400690; 10.1542/peds.2013-1632; 10.1017/S095457941400073X; 10.1017/S0954579408000473; 10.1017/S0954579413000795","<b>Conflict of Interest</b>: The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.","Erinn Bernstein Duprey, Assaf Oshri, Sihong Liu, Steven M Kogan, Margaret O'Brien Caughy","Department of Human Development and Family Science, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA."

Methods A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was performed using the data from the&#xa0;NHANES&#xa0;for the period 2009-2018 provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), amounting to a total of N = 10,032 eligible participants. The data were&#xa0;analyzed to study the relationship between opioid drug use (dividing into four dichotomy groups: drug use (DU) group, illicit drug use (IDU) group, repeated drug use (RDU) group, and current drug use (CDU) group) and cardiometabolic disease risk factors (CDRF) (i.e., hypertension, abnormal triglyceride levels, low-level of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), high waist circumference, insulin resistance, serum cotinine levels, higher C-reactive protein, hypercholesterolemia, and increased BMI). The statistical correlation was evaluated using the chi-square analysis, and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Alcohol use, age, race, ethnicity, education level, and poverty to income ratio (PIR) were analyzed as covariates.&#xa0; Results Overall, our analysis found that males were more likely than females (p &#x2264;&#xa0;0.001) to have ever reported using drugs at least once in their lifetime. In fact, males were more likely than females to report ever using cocaine (p = 0.01), heroin (p = 0.01), and marijuana (p = 0.01). Additionally, males were significantly more likely than females to disclose the current use of illicit drugs (p = 0.002), and also tend to have consumed more with at least 12 alcoholic beverages per year (p &lt; 0.001). Overall, we found no association between substance use and having a cluster of three or more CDRF variables for both males and females.

Patients with epilepsy (PWE) can face considerable stigma in society, and there have been various studies that evaluate the knowledge and attitude of the population towards epilepsy. However, there was no study of this kind in Morocco. Our aim was thus to assess knowledge, attitudes, and traditional practices specifically among relatives and caregivers of PWE in our community, in order to better evaluate their educational needs. This cross-sectional and descriptive study was carried out over a year long period in the outpatient neurology clinic of the Mohammed 6 University Hospital, a tertiary referral center in Marrakesh, Morocco. The respondents were relatives of PWE (usually parents and siblings) or spouses who attended the outpatient clinic alongside them. The interviews were carried out by the same investigator at the outpatient clinic during patient's visits, face-to-face using Moroccan Arabic or Darija, with an 18-item questionnaire. Responses of 100 participants were analyzed. The mean age was 40&#x202f;years old and 5&#x202f;months. Sixty-six percent of the respondents were women, 50% of rural origin and 76 % lived in an urban area. Forty-one percent were illiterate, and 74% were of low income. Only 65% of the participants knew the Arabic term for epilepsy. For 48%, epilepsy was linked with witchcraft or demonic possession. Seventy-five percent of the respondents had at least one prior consultation to a traditional healer. Only 5% in our study knew the first-aid basics to apply in case of a seizure. Despite having a relative with epilepsy, our participants' knowledge was very poor. The level of education and income seem to be the two major contributing factors. Cultural beliefs and superstition are very pervasive, and the majority of our sample had already used traditional healing and alternative medicine. Our study highlights the need for a more global intervention in Morocco encompassing healthcare policies, awareness campaigns, and educational reforms.","D000293; D000328; D017028; D003430; D004522; D004827; D005195; D005260; D007722; D006801; D008297; D008875; D009018; D011203; D012424; D057545; D013483; D011795; D018599; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Caregivers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Educational Status; Epilepsy; Family Relations; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Morocco; Poverty; Rural Population; Social Stigma; Superstitions; Surveys and Questionnaires; Witchcraft; Young Adult",NA,"NA","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no potential conflicts of interests with respect to the authorship and/or publication of this article.","Najib Kissani, Meryem Moro, Safa Arib","Neurology Department, Mohammed VI University Hospital, Marrakesh, Neurology Department, BP 7010, Sidi Abbad, Marrakech 40000, Morocco; Neurosciences Research Laboratory, Marrakesh Medical School, Cadi Ayyad University, Marrakesh, Morocco."

Social and behavioural factors are strongly interrelated in the prevention and control of CVD. The ability to make lifestyle changes to control hypertension and diabetes (major risk factors for CVD) is determined by factors such as education, gender, caste, poverty, and urbanicity. This study aimed to improve our understanding of the inter-relationship of social and behavioural factors in the management of elevated serum glucose and high blood pressure and co-morbid mental health conditions. A population-based catchment area cross sectional survey was conducted in Kerala, India. Data were collected from residents aged over 30&#x2009;years (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;997) using standardized tools and clinical measures. We performed latent class analysis incrementally to extract homogeneous latent classes of individuals based on their responses to social and behavioural risk factors in the survey. Using structural equation models, we assessed the mediating effect of depression and anxiety, and social or behavioural risk factors, on management of high blood pressure and raised serum glucose levels. The prevalence of high blood pressure and blood glucose in the sample was 33 and 26% respectively. Latent class analysis found three clusters of risk factors. One had a predominance of behavioural characteristics, another of social risk factors and the third was a low risk group. Age, female sex, and marital status had an effect on high blood pressure and high glucose, though were mediated by mental health, social and behavioural risk factors. Interventions to improve the management of risk factors for CVD need to address social risk factors and be sensitive to the needs of population sub-groups that may require additional support to access health services.

In this study, we aimed to understand women and healthcare workers' (HCWs) perspectives of antenatal depression, their treatment preferences and potential acceptability and feasibility of psychological interventions in the rural Ethiopian context. In-depth interviews were conducted with women who had previously scored above the locally validated cut-off (five or more) on the Patient Health Questionnaire during pregnancy (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8), primary healthcare workers (HCWs; nurses, midwives and health officers) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8) and community-based health extension workers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7). Translated interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Women expressed their distress largely through somatic complaints, such as a headache and feeling weak. Facility and community-based HCWs suspected antenatal depression when women reported reduced appetite, sleep problems, difficulty bonding with the baby, or if they refused to breast-feed or were poorly engaged with antenatal care. Both women and HCWs perceived depression as a reaction (""thinking too much"") to social adversities such as poverty, marital conflict, perinatal complications and losses. Depressive symptoms and social adversities were often attributed to spiritual causes. Women awaited God's will in isolation at home or talked to neighbours as coping mechanisms. HCWs' motivation to provide help, the availability of integrated primary mental health care and a culture among women of seeking advice were potential facilitators for acceptability of a psychological intervention. Fears of being seen publicly during pregnancy, domestic and farm workload and staff shortages in primary healthcare were potential barriers to acceptability of the intervention. Antenatal care providers such as midwives were considered best placed to deliver interventions, given their close interaction with women during pregnancy. Women and HCWs in rural Ethiopia linked depressive symptoms in pregnancy with social adversities, suggesting that interventions which help women cope with real-world difficulties may be acceptable. Intervention design should accommodate the identified facilitators and barriers to implementation.","D000328; D003150; D003863; D005002; D005260; D006282; D006801; D011247; D011248; D000083626; D012424; D055815","Adult; Community Health Workers; Depression; Ethiopia; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Psychosocial Intervention; Rural Population; Young Adult","MR/M014290/1; MR/M025470/1; MR/R018464/1","NA","The authors have no competing interests.","Tesera Bitew, Roxanne Keynejad, Simone Honikman, Katherine Sorsdahl, Bronwyn Myers, Abebaw Fekadu, Charlotte Hanlon","Addis Ababa University, College of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, WHO Collaborating Centre in Mental Health Research and Capacity-Building, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia."

To understand if Black and White adult Americans differ in the effects of self-rated health (SRH) on happiness. This cross-sectional study used data from the General Social Survey (GSS; 1972-2018), a nationally representative survey in the US. Our analytical sample included 42,201 Black and White adults. The independent variable was SRH. Happiness was the dependent variable. Sociodemographic factors were covariates. Race was the moderator. Logistic regression was used to analyze the data without and with interaction terms between race and SRH. Overall, good SRH was positively associated with happiness, however, there was a significant interaction between race/ethnicity and good SRH on the outcome (i.e.&#xa0;happiness) . This finding suggested that the boosting effect of good SRH on happiness is weaker for Black than White people. In the United States, due to a weaker concordance between good health and happiness, Blacks who have poor SRH are more likely to report happiness. At the same time, Whites who are healthy report happiness, however, Blacks who are healthy do not necessarily report happiness. Disjointed link between health and happiness may be due to different racial, ethnic, and cultural perceptions of physical health and happiness as well as salience of physical health as a component of happiness. This may be an adaptive response of Blacks to sociopolitical as well as health-related adversities over centuries as a result of the combination of oppression, injustice, and poverty.",NA,NA,"R25 MD007610; U54 MD007598","10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.2688; 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-0982; 10.1016/j.archger.2017.10.006; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.008; 10.1016/j.jeoa.2016.07.002; 10.1080/13557858.2017.1290216; 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2016.03.126; 10.1177/1557988318780844; 10.3390/healthcare6020037; 10.32892/jmri.179; 10.18865/ed.26.2.157; 10.3390/ijerph16101826; 10.3390/healthcare6010002; 10.3390/bs8110107; 10.3390/brainsci8090176; 10.3390/bs7030048; 10.1007/s11524-017-0217-3; 10.1007/s40615-016-0278-0; 10.1007/s40615-017-0426-1; 10.3390/brainsci8080140; 10.1007/s40615-015-0116-9; 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2009.00597.x; 10.3389/fpsyt.2016.00140; 10.1177/0022146519845069; 10.18865/ed.26.3.453; 10.12861/jrip.2015.27; 10.2105/AJPH.2008.143446; 10.15171/ijer.2019.14; 10.3390/jpm7040006; 10.15171/ijer.2017.02; 10.1007/s40615-017-0417-2; 10.1016/j.annepidem.2015.11.006; 10.1177/1557988315600064; 10.2105/AJPH.2004.060749; 10.1080/19485565.2014.937000; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.04.026; 10.15171/hpr.2019.17; 10.11648/j.ijbecs.20190502.12; 10.3390/brainsci8070122; 10.2307/2955359; 10.3390/ijerph16193641; 10.3390/jcm7050093; 10.1007/s40615-016-0239-7; 10.3390/brainsci8060108; 10.3390/brainsci8080139; 10.1111/sipr.12042; 10.15171/ijhpm.2017.90; 10.1007/s10903-014-0140-6; 10.1007/s11482-017-9517-8; 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2009.00598.x; 10.1097/NNR.0000000000000191; 10.1017/S0954579416000894; 10.1037/hea0000398; 10.1093/aje/kwq283; 10.1080/07399332.2017.1290099; 10.1177/0095798415597093; 10.1177/0361684316646716; 10.2105/AJPH.2015.302903; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.06.036; 10.1080/13696998.2019.1600525; 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2016-052934","The authors declare no conflict of interest in this work.","Sharon Cobb, Arash Javanbakht, Ebrahim Khalifeh Soltani, Mohsen Bazargan, Shervin Assari","Department of Family Medicine, Charles R Drew University of Medicine and Science, Los Angeles, CA, USA."

A community-based intervention was administered to 204 participants as part of a large randomised controlled trial (called the CIVIC trial). Case-managers followed-up participants with regular telephone calls and home visits over the first 2 years after discharge. The following data were collected alongside the trial: (i) chart audit of telephone calls and home visits (ii) recordings of 20 telephone calls (iii) interviews with 14 Intervention participants and four healthcare professionals including three case-managers. Participants received the target number of telephone calls and home visits. Pressure injuries were identified as a problem during at least one telephone call by 43% of participants. Participants and case-managers valued regular telephone calls and home visits, and believed that calls and visits prevented complications and alleviated social isolation. Participants trusted case-managers and were confident in the care and advice provided. Case-managers expressed concerns that people with SCI in Bangladesh face many problems impacting on well-being and motivation stemming from poverty, limited employment opportunities, societal attitudes and inaccessible environments. A community-based intervention involving regular telephone calls and home visits was administered as intended and was well received by the recipients of the care. Nonetheless, people with SCI in Bangladesh face economic and social problems which cannot be fully addressed by this type of intervention alone.","D001459; D006792; D006801; D010351; D013119; D013689","Bangladesh; House Calls; Humans; Patient Discharge; Spinal Cord Injuries; Telephone","APP1080259","10.1038/sc.2015.92; 10.1038/s41393-018-0211-y; 10.1038/sc.2015.179; 10.1007/s00264-005-0665-3; 10.1038/s41393-019-0300-6; 10.1038/s41393-019-0286-0; 10.1038/sc.2017.38; 10.1136/bmjopen-2012-001521; 10.1038/s41393-019-0394-x; 10.1038/sj.sc.3101750; 10.1038/sj.sc.3101991; 10.4073/csr.2015.15; 10.1016/j.apmr.2016.03.002; 10.1016/j.apmr.2017.02.005; 10.1038/sc.2016.163; 10.1177/0269215516654207; 10.1038/s41393-019-0382-1; 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010350; 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-024226; 10.1136/bmj.h1258; 10.1186/s13063-019-3181-2; 10.1038/s41393-019-0261-9","The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.","Hueiming Liu, Mohammad Sohrab Hossain, Md Shofiqul Islam, Md Akhlasur Rahman, Punam D Costa, Robert D Herbert, Stephen Jan, Ian D Cameron, Stephen Muldoon,  ..., Lisa A Harvey","John Walsh Centre for Rehabilitation Research, Kolling Institute, Sydney Medical School/Northern, University of Sydney, St Leonards, NSW, Australia."

Animal research suggests early life stressors impact later neurodevelopment, including myelin developmental growth. To determine how early life disadvantage may affect myelin growth in adolescence and young adulthood, we analysed data from an accelerated longitudinal neuroimaging study measuring magnetisation transfer (MT), a myelin-sensitive marker, in 288 participants (149 female) between 14 and 25&#x2009;years of age at baseline. We found that early life economic disadvantage before age 12, measured by a neighbourhood poverty index, was associated with slower myelin growth. This association was observed for magnetization transfer in cortical, subcortical and core white matter regions, and also in key subcortical nuclei. Participant IQ at baseline, alcohol use, body mass index, parental occupation and self-reported parenting quality did not account for these effects, but parental education did so partially. Specifically, positive parenting moderated the effect of socio-economic disadvantage in a protective manner. Thus, early socioeconomic disadvantage appears to alter myelin growth across adolescence. This finding has potential translational implications, including clarifying whether reducing socio-economic disadvantage during childhood, and increasing parental education and positive parenting, promote normal trajectories of brain development in economically disadvantaged contexts.","D000293; D000328; D000076783; D001921; D005260; D006803; D006801; D008137; D008279; D008297; D009186; D016487; D011203; D065840; D012111; D012959; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Brain; Female; Human Development; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Myelin Sheath; Parenting; Poverty; Protective Factors; Residence Characteristics; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult","2017-1261-04; 095844/7/11/Z; 098362/Z/12/Z; MC_G0802534; NF-SI-0514-10157; 27023; 211155/Z/18/Z","10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199574131.001.0001/acprof-9780199574131-chapter-3; 10.1177/2167702613501496; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.03.029; 10.1371/journal.pone.0018712; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.10.033; 10.1093/ije/dyx117; 10.1111/obr.12248; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.3139; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1808-18.2018; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.07.078; 10.1371/journal.pone.0127052; 10.1017/S1355617710001335; 10.1016/j.nicl.2014.08.013; 10.3389/fnins.2013.00095; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.1558","  The authors have no financial or non&#x2010;financial competing interests to declare.

Three parasitic infections - cerebral malaria, Taenia solium cysticercosis and onchocerciasis - have an established association with epilepsy. Parasitoses are widely prevalent in low-income and middle-income countries, which are home to 80% of the people with epilepsy in the world. Once a parasitic infection has taken hold in the brain, therapeutic measures do not seem to influence the development of epilepsy in the long term. Consequently, strategies to control, eliminate and eradicate parasites represent the most feasible way to reduce the epilepsy burden at present. The elucidation of immune mechanisms underpinning the parasitic infections, some of which are parasite-specific, opens up new therapeutic possibilities. In this Review, we explore the pathophysiological basis of the link between parasitic infections and epilepsy, and we consider preventive and therapeutic approaches to reduce the burden of epilepsy attributable to parasitic disorders. We conclude that a concerted approach involving medical, veterinary, parasitological and ecological experts, backed by robust political support and sustainable funding, is the key to reducing this burden.","D000818; D003551; D003906; D004827; D006801; D016779; D020019; D009855; D010271; D010272; D011203; D000079426; D015047","Animals; Cysticercosis; Developing Countries; Epilepsy; Humans; Malaria, Cerebral; Neurocysticercosis; Onchocerciasis; Parasites; Parasitic Diseases; Poverty; Vector Borne Diseases; Zoonoses",NA,"NA",NA,"Gagandeep Singh, Samuel A Angwafor, Alfred K Njamnshi, Henry Fraimow, Josemir W Sander","NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, London, UK."

The current meta-analytic review examines the effectiveness of these interventions in families experiencing social disadvantage. A literature search was conducted spanning March 2007-June 2019. Nine studies met inclusion criteria (total of 864 participants) which included an evaluation of a parenting intervention for families with at least one of the following demographic challenges, low socioeconomic status, single parenthood, and/or young parenthood. Interventions (or a component of the intervention) were delivered by computer, cell phone, smartphone, and/or tablet. Data were organized into three categories: parental psychological well-being (e.g., self-esteem, social support), parenting (e.g., observed or self-reported parenting behavior), and child behavior (e.g., disruptive behavior). Effect sizes (Hedges' g) were calculated and moderators (i.e., contact with an interventionist, intervention length, publication year, % female parents, mean parent age, parental education, % minority, and child age) were examined through Q-statistics and meta-regression, as appropriate. Intervention showed a near-significant impact on parental psychological well-being (g&#x2009;=&#x2009;.35, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.051). Furthermore, interventions that did not include direct contact with an interventionist showed no evidence of effectiveness (g&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#x2009;.02); interventions that incorporated contact were significantly more effective (g&#x2009;=&#x2009;.68). In addition, intervention length moderated intervention effectiveness; shorter interventions yielded greater improvements in well-being, compared with longer interventions. Interventions were also associated with significant improvements in parenting (g&#x2009;=&#x2009;.38) and child behavior (g&#x2009;=&#x2009;.39).

We wished to identify factors influencing health service utilization for adolescent perinatal depression, in Nigeria to inform new strategies of care delivery. Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted among purposively selected low-income young mothers (with medical histories of adolescent perinatal depression), and separately with primary care clinicians treating this condition in Ibadan, Nigeria. Participants from this community-based study were from the database of respondents who participated in a previous randomized control trial (RCT) conducted between 2014 and 2016 in 28 primary health care facilities in the 11 Local government areas in Ibadan. Semi-structured interview guides, framed by themes of the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, was developed to obtain views of participants on the factors that promote or hinder help-seeking and engagement (see additional files 1 &amp; 2). FGDs were conducted, and saturation of themes was achieved after discussions with six groups. Transcripts were analyzed using content analysis. A total of 42 participants, 17 mothers (who were adolescents at the time of the RCT), and 25 care providers participated in 6 FGDs. The availability of care for perinatal depression at the primary care level was an important enabling factor in healthcare utilization for the adolescents. Perceived health benefits of treatment received for perinatal depression were strong motivation for service use. Significant stigma and negative stereotypes expressed by care providers towards adolescent pregnancy and perinatal depression were obstacles to care. However, individual patient resilience was a major enabling factor, facilitating service engagement. Providers trained in the management of perinatal depression were perceived to deliver more tolerant and supportive care that adolescent mothers valued. Participants identified unsupportive and stigmatizing clinic environments towards pregnant and parenting adolescents as significant barriers to accessing available care. Interventions to reduce stigma among healthcare providers may improve services for this vulnerable population.","D000293; D003863; D005260; D017144; D007722; D006282; D006297; D006801; D008875; D009035; D009549; D010342; D018743; D011203; D011247; D011253; D011320; D036301; D057545; D055815","Adolescent; Depression; Female; Focus Groups; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Middle Aged; Mothers; Nigeria; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Perinatal Care; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy in Adolescence; Primary Health Care; Qualitative Research; Social Stigma; Young Adult","108552-001","NA","All contributing authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.","Lola Kola, Ian M Bennett, Amritha Bhat, Olatunde O Ayinde, Bibilola D Oladeji, Dolapo Abiona, Jibril Abdumalik, Neda Faregh, Pamela Y Collins, Oye Gureje","Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."

This study investigated perceptions and experiences of perinatal mental distress among women in a rural Ethiopian community, in an effort to advance understanding of cross-cultural experiences of perinatal mental distress. We employed a sequential explanatory study design. From a population-based cohort study of 1065 perinatal women in the Butajira Health and Demographic Surveillance Site, we purposively selected 22 women according to their scores on a culturally validated assessment of perinatal mental distress (the Self-Reporting Questionnaire). We examined concordance and discordance between qualitative semi-structured interview data ('emic' perspective) and the layperson-administered fully-structured questionnaire data ('etic' perspective) of perinatal mental distress. We analysed the questionnaire data using summary statistics and we carried out a thematic analysis of the qualitative data. Most women in this setting recognised the existence of perinatal mental distress states, but did not typically label such distress as a discrete illness. Instead, perinatal mental distress states were mostly seen as non-pathological reactions to difficult circumstances. The dominant explanatory model of perinatal mental distress was as a response to poverty, associated with inadequate food, isolation, and hopelessness. Support from family and friends, both emotional and instrumental support, was regarded as vital in protecting against mental distress. Although some women considered their distress amenable to biomedical solution, many thought medical help-seeking was inappropriate. Integration of perspectives from the questionnaire and semi-structured interviews highlighted the important role of somatic symptoms and nutritional status. It also demonstrated the differential likelihood of endorsement of symptoms when screening tools versus in-depth interviews are used. This study highlights the importance of the wider social context within which mental health problems are situated, specificially the inseparability of mental health from gender disadvantage, physical health and poverty. This implies that public health prevention strategies, assessments and interventions for perinatal distress should be developed from the bottom-up, taking account of local contexts and explanatory frameworks.","D015331; D005260; D006801; D001523; D008603; D036801; D011247; D012424","Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Parturition; Pregnancy; Rural Population","071643","10.4103/2141-9248.139268; 10.1016/j.jad.2017.05.003; 10.2471/BLT.11.091850; 10.1016/S2215-0366(16)30284-X; 10.1016/j.jad.2011.11.028; 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61277-0; 10.1192/bjp.151.4.447; 10.1016/0277-9536(83)90408-2; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02160.x; 10.1186/s12905-014-0140-7; 10.1177/1363461516632389; 10.1007/s00737-014-0431-x; 10.1186/s13033-017-0134-6; 10.1007/s00737-010-0149-3; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.07.043; 10.1007/BF00788925; 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.112.967885; 10.1016/j.jad.2007.10.023; 10.1097/00006842-200203000-00008; 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; 10.1111/1475-6773.12117; 10.1192/bjp.184.46.s10; 10.1016/j.whi.2016.07.002; 10.1016/j.jad.2015.06.029; 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010834; 10.1371/journal.pone.0163103; 10.1186/1471-244X-12-239; 10.1016/j.jad.2015.07.015; 10.1007/s11013-006-9040-0; 10.3402/qhw.v10.26226; 10.1186/1471-244X-14-60; 10.1016/j.healthplace.2012.05.004; 10.1136/bmj.321.7272.1311; 10.1016/S0968-8080(99)90004-6; 10.1111/tmi.12658; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.11.019; 10.1186/s12978-018-0637-x; 10.1186/1745-0179-5-8; 10.1177/1077801216654018; 10.1016/j.jad.2009.09.017","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Jil Molenaar, Charlotte Hanlon, Atalay Alem, Dawit Wondimagegn, Girmay Medhin, Martin Prince, Edward G J Stevenson","Department of Anthropology, Durham University, Dawson Building, South Road, Durham, DH1 3LE, UK."

To our knowledge, a complete, non-modelled national situational analysis based on the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery surgical indicators has not been done. We aimed to undertake a complete situation analysis of SAO system preparedness, service delivery, and financial risk protection using the core surgical indicators proposed by the Commission in Colombia, an upper-middle-income country. Data to inform the six core surgical system indicators were abstracted from the Colombian national health information system and the most recent national health survey done in 2007. Geographical access to a Bellwether hospital (defined as a hospital capable of providing essential and emergency surgery) within 2 h was assessed by determining 2 h drive time boundaries around Bellwether facilities and the population within and outside these boundaries. Physical 2 h access to a Bellwether was determined by the presence of a motor vehicle suitable for individual transportation. The Department Administrativo Nacional de Estad&#xed;stica population projection for 2016 and 2018 was used to calculate the SAO provider density. Total operative volume was calculated for 2016 and expressed nationally per 100&#x2008;000 population. The total number of postoperative deaths that occurred within 30 days of a procedure was divided by the total operative volume to calculate the all-cause, non-risk-adjusted postoperative mortality. The proportion of the population subject to impoverishing costs was calculated by subtracting the baseline number of impoverished individuals from those who fell below the poverty line once out-of-pocket payments were accounted for. Individuals who incurred out-of-pocket payments that were more than 10% of their annual household income were considered to have experienced catastrophic expenditure. Using GIS mapping, SAO system preparedness, service delivery, and cost protection were also contextualised by socioeconomic status. In 2016, at least 7&#xb7;1 million people (15&#xb7;1% of the population) in Colombia did not have geographical access to SAO services within a 2 h driving distance. SAO provider density falls short of the Commission's minimum target of 20 providers per 100&#x2008;000 population, at an estimated density of 13&#xb7;7 essential SAO health-care providers per 100&#x2008;000 population in 2018. Lower socioeconomic status of a municipality, as indicated by proportion of people enrolled in the subsidised insurance regime, was associated with a smaller proportion of the population in the municipality being within 2 h of a Bellwether facility, and the most socioeconomically disadvantaged municipalities often had no SAO providers. Furthermore, Colombian providers appear to be working at or beyond capacity, doing 2690-3090 procedures per 100&#x2008;000 population annually, but they have maintained a relatively low median postoperative mortality of 0&#xb7;74% (IQR 0&#xb7;48-0&#xb7;84). Finally, out-of-pocket expenses for indirect health-care costs were a key barrier to accessing surgical care, prompting 3&#xb7;1 million (6&#xb7;4% of the population) individuals to become impoverished and 9&#xb7;5 million (19&#xb7;4% of the population) individuals to incur catastrophic expenditures in 2007. We did a non-modelled, indicator-based situation analysis of the Colombian SAO system, finding that it has not yet met, but is working towards achieving, the targets set by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery. The observed interdependence of these indicators and correlation with socioeconomic status are consistent with well recognised factors and outcomes of social, health, and health-care inequity. The internal consistency observed in Colombia's situation analysis validates the use of the indicators and has now informed development of an early national SAO plan in Colombia, to set a data-informed stage for implementation and evaluation of timely, safe, and affordable SAO health care, within the National Public Health Decennial Plan, which is due in 2022.

In this paper, we describe a case study in which leading global experts systematically: (1) developed a conceptual model that outlines the potential pathways through which a social policy influences health, (2) fits outcome measures to this conceptual model, and (3) estimates an optimal time frame for collection of the selected outcome measures. This systematic process, called the Delphi method, has the potential to produce estimates more quickly and with less bias than might be achieved through expert panel discussions alone. Our case study is a multi-component randomized-controlled trial (RCT) of a workforce policy called MyGoals for Healthy Aging.","D019049; D006801; D007182; D017063; D011640; D016032; D064890; D014481","Developed Countries; Humans; Income; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Public Policy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Social Determinants of Health; United States","R56 AG062485","10.1093/heapro/dap006; 10.1007/BF02185046; 10.2190/XXMM-JMQU-2A7Y-HX1E; 10.1056/NEJM197407252910404; 10.1056/NEJMp1406838; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.04.005; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05340.x; 10.1111/1468-0009.12451; 10.1126/science.1224648; 10.1126/science.1248429; 10.1056/NEJMsa1212321; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05337.x; 10.1353/hpu.0.0018; 10.1093/aje/kwr011; 10.1007/s11357-018-0042-y; 10.1073/pnas.081072698; 10.1056/NEJM199801153380307; 10.7748/nr2006.10.14.1.59.c6010; 10.1111/desc.12246; 10.3233/WOR-2010-1049; 10.1080/14768320701212099; 10.1097/01.psy.0000221236.37158.b9; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.037; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05341.x","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","Peter Muennig, Bruce McEwen, Daniel W Belsky, Kimberly G Noble, James Riccio, Jennifer Manly","Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."

We examined the differences in adult earnings of males and females with and without a history of depressive disorder in adolescence, with specific focuses on (1) future earnings in clinical subtypes of adolescent depression; (2) the growth and distribution of earnings over time within these subgroups and (3) the mediating role of subsequent depressive episodes occurring in early adulthood. Data were drawn from the Uppsala Longitudinal Adolescent Depression Study, a community-based cohort study initiated in Uppsala, Sweden, in the early 1990s. Comprehensive diagnostic assessments were conducted at age 16-17 and in follow-up interviews 15 years later, while consecutive data on earnings for the years 1996 to 2016 (ages 20-40) were drawn from population-based registries. The current study included participants with a history of persistent depressive disorder (PDD) (n = 175), episodic major depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 82), subthreshold depression (n = 64) or no depression (n = 218) in adolescence. The association of adolescent depression with earnings in adulthood was analysed using generalised estimating equations. Estimates were adjusted for major child and adolescent psychiatric comorbidities and parental socioeconomic status. The indirect (mediated) effect of depression in early adulthood (ages 19-30) on earnings in mid-adulthood (31-40) was estimated in mediation analysis. The study followed the 'STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology' (STROBE) guidelines. Earnings across early to middle adulthood were lower for participants with a history of a PDD in adolescence than for their non-depressed peers, with an adjusted ratio of mean earnings of 0.85 (0.77-0.95) for females and 0.76 (0.60-0.95) for males. The differences were consistent over time, and more pronounced in the lower percentiles of the earnings distributions. The association was partially mediated by recurrent depression in early adulthood (48% in total; 61% for females, 29% for males). No reduction in earnings was observed among participants with episodic MDD in adolescence, while results for subthreshold depression were inconclusive. Our findings suggest that future earnings of adolescents with depressive disorders are contingent on the duration and natural long-term course of early-onset depression, emphasising the need for timely and effective interventions to avoid loss of human capital.","D000293; D000328; D015331; D003863; D004651; D005260; D006801; D007182; D008137; D008297; D011203; D012923; D013548; D014478; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Cohort Studies; Depression; Employment; Female; Humans; Income; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Poverty; Social Class; Sweden; Unemployment; Young Adult","R01 MH117559","NA","None.","Anna Philipson, Iman Alaie, Richard Ssegonja, Henrik Imberg, William Copeland, Margareta M&#xf6;ller, Lars Hagberg, Ulf Jonsson","Department of Neuroscience, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."

Maternal health may be improved through strengthened support networks and better health literacy. Health improvement at the population level requires optimizing of the collaboration between statutory health services, civic organizations (e.g., churches, schools), as well as community groups and parents. Two key elements in improving community engagement are co-production and community control. This study evaluated a co-produced and community-led project, PACT (Parents and Communities Together), for mothers in a deprived south London borough. The project offered social support and health education. Intended effects were improvements in mental health, health literacy, and social support, assessed by standardized measures in a pre-post design. Sixty-one mothers consented to take part in the evaluation. Significant improvements were found in mental health measures, in health literacy, for those with low literacy at baseline, and in overall and some specific aspects of social support. Satisfaction with the project was high. We found that the project engaged local populations that access statutory health services relatively less. We conclude that community-organized and community-led interventions in collaboration with statutory health services can increase accessibility and can improve mothers' mental health and other health-related outcomes.","D000328; D002648; D003153; D005192; D005260; D006266; D057220; D006801; D008131; D000068097; D009035; D011181; D011203; D012944; D012959; D006113","Adult; Child; Community Health Services; Family Health; Female; Health Education; Health Literacy; Humans; London; Maternal Health; Mothers; Postnatal Care; Poverty; Social Support; Socioeconomic Factors; United Kingdom",NA,"10.1093/bmb/ldr047; 10.1016/0029-7844(94)00449-n; 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2011.03701.x; 10.1093/heapro/15.3.259; 10.1093/heapro/dax015; 10.1136/bmj.m693; 10.1093/pubmed/fdv017; 10.3390/ijerph17072523; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.11.027; 10.1111/1467-9515.00300; 10.1001/archinte.166.10.1092; 10.3928/0048-5713-20020901-06; 10.1370/afm.405; 10.1001/jama.2010.896; 10.1093/wbro/15.2.225; 10.2105/AJPH.2010.300113; 10.1046/j.1365-2648.1999.01041.x; 10.1007/BF00918174; 10.1007/BF00927113; 10.1002/bin.2360040104; 10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.155; 10.1186/1472-6963-12-249; 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012337; 10.1186/s12888-016-0736-6; 10.1007/s00127-014-0900-6; 10.3399/bjgp10X501877; 10.1186/s12888-014-0275-y; 10.1177/1049732315591483; 10.1177/0020764009357400; 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2013.04.006; 10.1007/s10865-019-00046-z; 10.1037/bul0000015; 10.1007/s00127-017-1421-x; 10.1017/S2045796013000504","The authors declare no conflict of interest.

All original and expanded ACEs loaded on one of these two factors and all individual ACEs were associated with either poor self-rated mental health, physical health or both in unadjusted models and with the majority of findings remaining statistically significant in adjusted models (Adjusted Odds Ratios ranged from 1.16-3.25 among parents and 1.12-8.02 among adolescents). Additionally, both factors were associated with poor mental and physical health. Findings confirm a two-factor structure (i.e., 1) child maltreatment and peer victimization and 2) household challenges) and indicate that the ACEs list should include original ACEs (i.e., physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, emotional neglect, physical neglect, exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV), household substance use, household mental health problems, parental separation or divorce, parental problems with police) and expanded ACEs (i.e., spanking, peer victimization, household gambling problems, foster care placement or child protective organization (CPO) contact, poverty, and neighborhood safety).","D000293; D000076783; D002170; D002648; D002649; D005163; D006801; D010290","Adolescent; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Canada; Child; Child Abuse; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Humans; Parents",NA,"10.1016/S0749-3797(98)00017-8; 10.1001/jama.282.17.1652; 10.1542/peds.111.3.564; 10.1016/j.amepre.2007.01.005; 10.1016/j.jad.2003.12.013; 10.1001/jama.286.24.3089; 10.1016/j.ypmed.2019.03.032; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181907888; 10.1186/1471-2458-10-20; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2004.01.008; 10.1016/S0306-4603(01)00204-0; 10.1016/j.amepre.2015.07.022; 10.1016/j.ypmed.2011.06.015; 10.1542/peds.2007-3412; 10.1016/j.amepre.2018.10.016; 10.1001/archpedi.159.12.1104; 10.1007/s00406-005-0624-4; 10.1016/j.amepre.2008.02.002; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2015.08.017; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2009.09.020; 10.1542/peds.2009-0597; 10.1016/j.acap.2008.11.003; 10.1037/ort0000144; 10.1177/070674370505001207; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.420; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2015.07.011; 10.1016/j.amepre.2015.02.001; 10.1016/j.pedhc.2018.04.021; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2015.11.021; 10.1037/a0037723; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2017.01.014; 10.1177/1077559516679513; 10.1037/pas0000691; 10.1007/s11469-007-9126-0; 10.1007/BF03404366; 10.1177/1524838014561269; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2019.01.024; 10.1007/s10899-017-9669-3; 10.1556/2006.6.2017.077; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2017.03.016; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2009.07.010; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2013.09.004; 10.1017/S0033291718000181; 10.1177/0706743719833675; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2008.05.003; 10.1542/peds.2012-4021; 10.1542/peds.2011-2947; 10.1186/s12889-017-4359-8; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00218.x","The authors declare that they have no competing interest.","Tracie O Afifi, Samantha Salmon, Isabel Garc&#xe9;s, Shannon Struck, Janique Fortier, Tamara Taillieu, Ashley Stewart-Tufescu, Gordon J G Asmundson, Jitender Sareen, Harriet L MacMillan","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, and of Pediatrics, Offord Centre for Child Studies, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."

Specific social and financial factors mediate the effects of financial crisis on mental health, such as poverty, financial difficulties and unemployment. During the recent international financial crisis, studies in many countries have shown that the worsening of various mental health indicators was related to financial difficulties and unemployment. In Greece, which is one of the countries that experienced intense and prolonged economic and social burden due to the recent crisis, the epidemiological findings were similar and the increase of the prevalence of major depression and suicide was excessive. However, the information about the mental health of the population deriving from health services is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the crisis on community mental health -more specifically the rates of mental disorders and suicide, as well as the role of unemployment- among the new cases of a community mental health unit. The sample consisted of 1,865 adult users, men and women, who came seeking for help to the Byron-Kessariani Community Mental Health Centre (CMHC) during the years 2008-2013, i.e. the early years of the current crisis. Regarding the rates of the diagnostic categories in the new cases of CMHC per year, no significant differentiation was observed. There was an increase in the proportion of the unemployed individuals in the total sample of new cases during the study, from 9.65% in 2008 to 26.17% in 2013 and a significant association between unemployment and the occurrence of anxiety and depressive disorders, as indicated by the increase in the proportion of unemployed individuals among new cases with disorders of these categories. There was an upward trend in the rate of new patients referred to CMHC after a suicide attempt, which was doubled during the first years of the crisis. There was also an increase in the rate of unemployed individuals among these cases, from 10% in 2008 to 41.7% in 2009, reaching the highest level in 2011 (53.3%). The findings of this study suggest that during economic crisis unemployment plays an important role in the development of anxiety and depressive disorders and is closely related to suicide attempts.

Participants were 187 healthy mothers and their full-term infants (86 girls) from the Netherlands, followed from birth to age 1. Home observations of mothers' behavior were conducted during a naturalistic task (bathing session) when infants were 5 weeks old. Trained researchers interviewed mothers about the infants' health and prescribed antibiotic use every month for 12 months. Infant health problems were categorized into 4 domains according to the International Classification of Primary Care to capture a range of outcomes: respiratory, digestive, skin, and general illnesses and symptoms. Controlling for health-related covariates (e.g., maternal smoking and breastfeeding), maternal sensitivity predicted reduced rates of infant respiratory symptoms and skin conditions and marginally lower prescribed antibiotic use over the first year. Maternal behavior was unrelated to infant digestive and general illnesses. Even in the absence of adversity, quality of maternal care may have implications for the development of physical health, beginning as early as the first year of life.

However, the mechanisms by which schizophrenia may have influenced the economic status of a household in rural communities are still unclear. This study aimed to test an integrated model of schizophrenia, social support and caregiving burden on household poverty in a rural community in China. A mental health survey using identical methods and ICD-10 was conducted in six townships of Xinjin County (population&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;15&#xa0;years old, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;152,776), Chengdu, China in 2015. Identified persons with schizophrenia (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;661) and their caregivers completed a joint questionnaire of sociodemographic information, illness conditions, social support and caregiving burden. Descriptive analysis was applied first to give an overview of the dataset. Then, multivariable regression analyses were conducted to examine the associative factors of social support, caregiving burden and household income. Then, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to estimate the integrated model of schizophrenia, social support, caregiving burden and household income. Households with patient being female, married, able to work and having better social function were better off. Larger household size, higher social support and lower caregiving burden also had salient association with higher household income. The relationship between schizophrenia and household poverty appeared to be mediated by the impacts of schizophrenia on social support and caregiving burden. There was a strong association between schizophrenia and household poverty, in which social support and caregiving burden may had played significant roles on mediating it. More precise poverty alleviation policies and interventions should focus on supporting recovery for persons with schizophrenia, as well as on increasing social support and on reducing family caregiving burden.","D017028; D002681; D017281; D005260; D006801; D011203; D012424; D012559; D012944","Caregivers; China; Cost of Illness; Female; Humans; Poverty; Rural Population; Schizophrenia; Social Support","Dept.

While the developed world continues to take advantage of this technology, its concept remains new to Pakistan. This study aims to assess the knowledge and perceptions regarding telemedicine among health care professionals in Karachi, Pakistan. Methods&#xa0; This cross-sectional study was carried out among doctors employed in the public health sector in Karachi from June 2018 to August 2018. Data were&#xa0;collected using a self-designed well-structured questionnaire using a five-point Likert scale, built after an extensive literature review. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS version 22. Categorical data were reported as frequencies and percentages. Results A total of 224 doctors, working in the Department of Internal Medicine (27.6%), Pediatrics (9.8%), Cardiology (6.6%), Gynecology (5.35%), Neurology (5.8%), and other specialties (44.6%), participated in the study. A total of 80.7 % of the doctors were aware of the definition of telemedicine. A total of 28.1% of them believed telemedicine to be effective in providing faster medical care while 23.2% thought of it as a means of reducing the white coat syndrome. A total of 42.9% believed that telemedicine disrupts the doctor-patient relationship and causes a breach of patient privacy. A total of 34.8% of the doctors favored the idea of introducing national standards for practicing telemedicine while 33.5% of doctors also agreed that providing a legal explanation of telemedicine to patients was of paramount importance. Poverty and lack of education (90.6%) was thought to be the biggest barrier to the practice of telemedicine in the developing world. Conclusions The knowledge regarding telemedicine among doctors in Karachi was found to be average. However, the perceptions about and attitude towards the introduction and implementation of this new technology were welcomed by the majority of participants with an emphasis on increasing awareness.

To investigate whether lower IQ contributed to the association between population density or deprivation and nonaffective psychosis (mediation) and whether these associations were stronger in people with lower IQ (effect modification). This prospective cohort study evaluated a population-based sample of men born in Sweden from January 1, 1982, to December 31, 1988, and conscripted into military service at 18 years of age. Data were collected from January 1, 1982, to December 31, 2016, and analyzed from May 1 to December 31, 2018. Continuous measures of small area-level population density (persons per square kilometer) and socioeconomic deprivation at birth. Deprivation was based on area-level social, criminal, and unemployment data. IQ was assessed during conscription at 18 years of age (mean [SD] IQ, 100 [15]). First diagnosis of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, nonaffective psychosis from 18 years of age until December 31, 2016, recorded in the National Patient Register. The study sample included a total of 227&#x202f;429 men who were classified as at risk of psychosis from 18 years of age until the end of follow-up. Of these, 1596 men (0.7%) were diagnosed with nonaffective psychosis. After adjustments for confounders, odds of nonaffective psychosis increased per 1-SD increase in population density (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.14) and deprivation (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13) at birth. IQ was negatively associated with deprivation after adjustments (effect estimate per 1-SD increase in deprivation: -0.70 points; 95% CI, -0.78 to -0.62 points) but not with population density. In mediation analyses, based on the potential outcome framework, 23% (95% CI, 17%-49%) of the total effect of deprivation on nonaffective psychosis was mediated by IQ. IQ did not modify associations between deprivation or population density and nonaffective psychosis. These findings suggest that being born in more deprived neighborhoods may partly increase risk of nonaffective psychosis through subsequent effects on cognitive development, consistent with the wider literature on neurodevelopmental delays associated with psychotic disorder. Identifying factors in deprived environments that give rise to this process could inform public health strategies to prevent nonaffective psychosis.","D000293; D000328; D015331; D006801; D007360; D008297; D011156; D011203; D011618; D012042; D012111; D013548; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Cohort Studies; Humans; Intelligence; Male; Population Density; Poverty; Psychotic Disorders; Registries; Residence Characteristics; Sweden; Young Adult","G0701503; 201486/Z/16/Z; 101272/Z/13/Z","10.1093/schbul/sbs096; 10.1002/wps.20056; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.101; 10.1093/schbul/sbs151; 10.1056/NEJM199902253400803; 10.1192/bjp.184.4.293; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.0577; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.3554; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.2640; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.1581; 10.1017/S0033291717001696; 10.1093/schbul/sbu105; 10.1038/s41588-018-0152-6; 10.1016/S0140-6736(94)90569-X; 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62036-X; 10.1016/j.schres.2011.06.017; 10.1001/archpsyc.61.4.354; 10.1037/a0021072; 10.1038/nrg.2017.104; 10.1016/j.intell.2014.10.002; 10.1037/a0035893; 10.1073/pnas.1106077109; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.4491; 10.1016/j.schres.2009.10.015; 10.1017/S1355617702813248; 10.1093/schbul/sbw147; 10.1186/1471-2458-11-450; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.2233; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.0583; 10.1136/jech.2002.006361; 10.1093/ije/31.2.422; 10.1177/0956797618774253; 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2010.09.003; 10.1038/npp.2015.274; 10.1016/0005-7967(94)90131-7; 10.1093/schbul/sbs147; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2009.01500.x; 10.1093/ije/dyy193; 10.1017/S0033291797005680; 10.1037/a0020761; 10.1093/aje/kwj169; 10.1038/tp.2016.62","<b>Conflict of Interest Disclosures:</b> Dr Karlsson reported receiving grants from Stanley Medical Research Institute during the conduct of the study.

The National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;8981) is used to classify children into 5 categories based on their family's pattern of SA use from age 4-5 to 10-11: always or never on SA, a single transition on or off SA, or fluctuations on and off SA. Latent growth modelling is used to compare trajectories of emotional and behavioural problems among children with different patterns of SA exposure to their counterparts never on SA over this same time period. Child emotional and behavioural problems are exacerbated over time in accordance with patterns of SA use: chronic SA use (behavioural) and moving onto SA (emotional and behavioural). These differential rates of change result in mental health disparities at age 10-11 that were not present at age 4-5. Children exposed to SA when they were age 4-5 but subsequently moved off continue to demonstrate elevated levels of emotional and behavioural problems at age 10-11. Successful social policies and interventions will require understanding the specific mechanisms through which SA undermines child mental health and how programs can be modified to reduce its negative consequences.

Mental health research evidence translation into policymaking is a 'wicked problem', often failing despite a robust evidence base. In a recent systematic review, we identified a gap in frameworks on agenda setting and actionability, and pragmatic, effective tools to guide action to link research and policy are needed. Responding to this gap, we developed the new EVITA 1.1 (EVIdence To Agenda setting) conceptual framework for mental health research-policy interrelationships in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We (1) drafted a provisional framework (EVITA 1.0); (2) validated it for specific applicability to mental health; (3) conducted expert in-depth interviews to (a) validate components and mechanisms and (b) assess intelligibility, functionality, relevance, applicability and effectiveness. To guide interview validation, we developed a simple evaluation framework. (4) Using deductive framework analysis, we coded and identified themes and finalized the framework (EVITA 1.1). Theoretical agenda-setting elements were added, as targeting the policy agenda-setting stage was found to lead to greater policy traction. The framework was validated through expert in-depth interviews (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;13) and revised. EVITA 1.1 consists of six core components [advocacy coalitions, (en)actors, evidence generators, external influences, intermediaries and political context] and four mechanisms (capacity, catalysts, communication/relationship/partnership building and framing). EVITA 1.1 is novel and unique because it very specifically addresses the mental health research-policy process in LMICs and includes policy agenda setting as a novel, effective mechanism. Based on a thorough methodology, and through its specific design and mechanisms, EVITA has the potential to improve the challenging process of research evidence translation into policy and practice in LMICs and to increase the engagement and capacity of mental health researchers, policy agencies/planners, think tanks, NGOs and others within the mental health research-policy interface. Next, EVITA 1.1 will be empirically tested in a case study.","D003906; D055317; D006291; D006801; D007407; D008603; D011050; D011203; D012106","Developing Countries; Evidence-Based Practice; Health Policy; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Mental Health; Policy Making; Poverty; Research","MR/R023697/1; MR/S001255/1","NA",NA,"Nicole Votruba, Jonathan Grant, Graham Thornicroft","Centre for Global Mental Health, Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London, De Crespigny Park, Denmark Hill, London SE5 8AF, UK."

Furthermore, previous research has yielded conflicting results. Thus, we investigated this association in adults from 38 LMICs. Data from the World Health Survey (WHS), a cross-sectional, predominantly nationally representative survey conducted in 2002-2004, were analyzed. PA was assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and participants were dichotomized into those who do (&#x2265;150&#xa0;min of moderate-to-vigorous PA per week) and do not (&lt;150&#xa0;min&#xa0;=&#xa0;low PA) comply with the World Health Organization PA recommendations. Those who provided help to a relative or friend (adult or child), because this person has a long-term physical or mental illness or disability, or is getting old and weak in the past year were considered to be informal caregivers. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the associations. There were 204,315 adults aged &#x2265;18&#xa0;years from 38 LMICs included in this study [mean (standard deviation) age 38.6 (16.1) years; 50.7% female]. Overall, the prevalence of caregiving and low PA was 19.5% and 29.9%, respectively. After adjustment for potential confounders, caregivers were at a lower risk for low PA compared to non-caregivers (OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.79; 95% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.72-0.86). Engagement in greater number of caregiving activities was associated with lower odds for low PA dose-dependently. Informal caregiving was associated with higher levels of PA in adults in LMICs.

Research, albeit limited, has focused predominantly on adults. There is a paucity of literature about stigma reduction strategies concerning children and adolescents, with evidence especially sparse for low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). This systematic review synthesised child-focused stigma reduction strategies in LMIC, and compared these to adult-focused interventions. Relevant publications were systematically searched in July and August 2018 in the following databases; Cochrane, Embase, Global Health, HMIC, Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed and WorldWideScience.org, and through Google Custom Search. Included studies and identified reviews were cross-referenced. Three categories of search terms were used: (i) stigma, (ii) intervention, and (iii) LMIC settings. Data on study design, participants and intervention details including strategies and implementation factors were extracted. Within 61 unique publications describing 79 interventions, utilising 14 unique stigma reduction strategies, 14 papers discussed 21 interventions and 10 unique strategies involving children. Most studies targeted HIV/AIDS (50% for children, 38% for adults) or mental illness (14% vs 34%) stigma. Community education (47%), individual empowerment (15%) and social contact (12%) were most employed in child-focused interventions. Most interventions were implemented at one socio-ecological level; child-focused interventions mostly employed community-level strategies (88%). Intervention duration was mostly short; between half a day and a week. Printed or movie-based material was key to deliver child-focused interventions (37%), while professionals most commonly implemented adult-focused interventions (53%). Ten unique, child-focused strategies were all evaluated positively, using a diverse set of scales. Children and adolescents are under-represented in stigma reduction in LMIC. More stigma reduction interventions in LMIC, addressing a wider variety of stigmas, with children as direct and indirect target group, are needed.

Data were collected at the prescribing visit (baseline) and at one and three months of follow up from 78 families. Family characteristics were identified at baseline; regression models were used to explore changes during follow up in associations of park use with knowledge, attitudes and perceived access to parks. At baseline, park users differed from non-users in demographics, knowledge of park locations, attitudes about the value of park visits, but not affinity for nature. Park users were also more likely than non-users to feel that their neighborhood was safe for children to play in. Changes in knowledge of park locations, nature affinity, and perceived access to parks were each significantly associated with increased park use by families at one and three months after the park prescription. Adjusting for age, gender, race, poverty, and US birth, increases in knowing the location of parks were associated with an increase of 0.27 weekly park visits (95% CI 0.05, 0.49; <i>p</i> = 0.016); increases in feeling a caregiver had money to visit parks were associated with 0.48 more weekly park visits (95% CI 0.28, 0.69; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001); increases in perceived money for park outings were associated with 0.24 increased park visits per week (95% CI 0.05, 0.42; <i>p</i> = 0.01); each unit increase in nature affinity was associated with 0.34 more weekly park visits (95% CI 0.09, 0.59; <i>p</i> = 0.007). In other words, knowing where to go, valuing nature, and having time, and money contributed to increased likelihood of visiting a park.

This link may exist because malnutrition and infection, which are known to affect height and weight, also impact brain structure according to animal models. However, a relationship between anthropometric indicators and brain structural measures has not been tested yet, perhaps because stunting, underweight, and wasting are uncommon in higher-resource settings. Further, with diminished anthropometric growth prevalent in low-resource settings, where biological and psychosocial hazards are most severe, one might expect additional links between measures of poverty, anthropometry, and brain structure. To begin to examine these relationships, we conducted an MRI study in 2-3-month-old infants growing up in the extremely impoverished urban setting of Dhaka, Bangladesh. The sample size was relatively small because the challenges of investigating infant brain structure in a low-resource setting needed to be realized and resolved before introducing a larger cohort. Initially, fifty-four infants underwent T<sub>1</sub> sequences using 3T MRI, and resulting structural images were segmented into gray and white matter maps, which were carefully evaluated for accurate tissue labeling by a pediatric neuroradiologist. Gray and white matter volumes from 29 infants (79&#xa0;&#x200b;&#xb1;&#xa0;&#x200b;10 days-of-age; F/M&#xa0;&#x200b;=&#xa0;&#x200b;12/17), whose segmentations were of relatively high quality, were submitted to semi-partial correlation analyses with stunting, underweight, and wasting, which were measured using height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and weight-for-height (WHZ) scores. Positive semi-partial correlations (after adjusting for chronological age and sex and correcting for multiple comparisons) were observed between white matter volume and HAZ and WAZ; however, WHZ was not correlated with any measure of brain volume. No associations were observed between income-to-needs or maternal education and brain volumetric measures, suggesting that measures of poverty were not associated with total brain tissue volume in this sample. Overall, these results provide the first link between diminished anthropometric growth and white matter volume in infancy.

Change in FI status over 12&#xa0;months of follow-up was measured using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale. Multivariable models were used to assess improvement in FI. Direct and indirect mediators of change in FI status were modelled using path analysis. A total of 239 (81.8%) people with SMI and 273 (96.5%) control households were assessed after 12&#xa0;months. Maintenance of food security or improvement in food insecurity status was observed in 51.5% of households of a person with SMI vs. 39.7% of control households (adjusted risk ratio 1.41: 95% CI 1.11, 1.80). Reduction in symptom severity was indirectly associated with improved FI status via an impact on reducing work impairment and discrimination (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). Improving access to mental health care may reduce food insecurity in households of people with SMI. Optimising engagement in care and adding interventions to improve work functioning and tackle discrimination may further reduce food insecurity.

A Qualitative Study.","Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is associated with low rates of treatment and medication non-adherence, more so in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Mobile mental health (mHealth) interventions offer promise as a tool to address these problems. However, the feasibility and acceptability of mHealth interventions among rural women in LMICs is unknown. We examined barriers to accessing mental health treatment, reasons for non-adherence, and attitudes towards mHealth solutions among women with MDD in rural south India. Six focus groups were conducted among women with MDD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;69) who had been in treatment at a rural community health center. The discussion was transcribed and analyzed using a modified grounded-theory approach. Women perceived limited autonomy within their family structure, and experienced financial and systemic barriers as contributing to poor treatment access and non-adherence. Illiteracy, limited personal access to mobile phones, and preference for in-person clinical consultation were identified as barriers to use of mHealth. This is the first qualitative study, to our knowledge, that examines attitude towards mHealth among women with MDD in a rural setting in India. The study identified contextual barriers that will be important to address before implementing mHealth interventions.","D000328; D000368; D000369; D040421; D003156; D003865; D005260; D017144; D006297; D006801; D007194; D008875; D011203; D036301; D012424; D017216; D055815","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cell Phone; Community Mental Health Services; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Focus Groups; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; India; Middle Aged; Poverty; Qualitative Research; Rural Population; Telemedicine; Young Adult","the Rotary Clubs of Bangalore, Midtown; Howard West; Yale Global Mental Health program","NA",NA,"A Bhat, B Ramakrishna Goud, J R Pradeep, G Jayaram, R Radhakrishnan, K Srinivasan","Department of Psychiatry, St John's Medical College Hospital, Bengaluru, India."

The association of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage with brain volume in this context is not well known. To test whether neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with decreased brain volume in a cognitively unimpaired population enriched for Alzheimer disease risk. This study, conducted from January 6, 2010, to January 17, 2019, at an academic research neuroimaging center, used cross-sectional data on 951 participants from 2 large, ongoing cohort studies of Alzheimer disease (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention and Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center clinical cohort). Participants were cognitively unimpaired based on National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association workgroup diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease, confirmed through a consensus diagnosis panel. The cohort was enriched for Alzheimer disease risk based on family history of dementia. Statistical analysis was performed from April 3 to September 27, 2019. The Area Deprivation Index, a geospatially determined index of neighborhood-level disadvantage, and cardiovascular disease risk indices were calculated for each participant. Linear regression models were fitted to test associations between relative neighborhood-level disadvantage (highest 20% based on state of residence) and hippocampal and total brain tissue volume, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. In the primary analysis of 951 participants (637 women [67.0%]; mean [SD] age, 63.9 [8.1] years), living in the 20% most disadvantaged neighborhoods was associated with 4.1% lower hippocampal volume (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-317.44; 95% CI, -543.32 to -91.56; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.006) and 2.0% lower total brain tissue volume (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-20&#x202f;959.67; 95% CI, -37&#x202f;611.92 to -4307.43; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01), after controlling for intracranial volume, individual-level educational attainment, age, and sex. Robust propensity score-matched analyses determined that this association was not due to racial/ethnic or demographic characteristics. Cardiovascular risk score, examined in a subsample of 893 participants, mediated this association for total brain tissue but not for hippocampal volume. For cognitively unimpaired individuals, living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods was associated with significantly lower cerebral volumes, after controlling for maximal premorbid (total intracranial) volume. This finding suggests an association of community socioeconomic context, distinct from individual-level socioeconomic status, with brain volume during aging. Cardiovascular risk mediated this association for total brain tissue volume but not for hippocampal volume, suggesting that neighborhood-level disadvantage may be associated with these 2 outcomes via distinct biological pathways.","D000368; D000544; D002540; D003430; D005260; D006624; D006801; D008279; D008297; D008875; D059906; D009929; D011203; D012307; D012959","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Cerebral Cortex; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging; Organ Size; Poverty; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors","R01 AG021155; R01 AG037639; P50 AG033514; T32 GM008692; R01 MD010243; F31 AG062116; RF1 AG027161; R56 AG037639; RF1 AG057784; R01 AG054059; P30 AG062715; R01 AG027161","10.1016/S1474-4422(13)70044-9; 10.1016/j.nicl.2018.06.023; 10.1016/S1474-4422(17)30077-7; 10.1001/jamaneurol.2017.0244; 10.1212/01.WNL.0000161871.83614.BB; 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00307; 10.1007/s00234-012-1005-0; 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2007.10.008; 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2010.09.023; 10.1001/archneurol.2007.27; 10.1093/arclin/acv041; 10.18865/ed.25.3.245; 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2018.04.002; 10.1016/j.psychres.2011.11.012; 10.1093/aje/kwh018; 10.1056/NEJMsa1103216; 10.1056/NEJMp1802313; 10.1177/1062860617753063; 10.2188/jea.JE20140117; 10.1136/jech-2015-205542; 10.1136/jech.52.6.399; 10.7326/M13-2946; 10.1161/STROKEAHA.111.622134; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.03.031; 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00277; 10.1097/WNR.0b013e328332bb09; 10.1038/srep29127; 10.1111/psyp.13025; 10.1016/S0006-3223(02)01359-8; 10.1016/j.ypmed.2017.09.017; 10.1111/pedi.12683; 10.2337/dc15-2800; 10.1161/01.HYP.0000132475.32317.bb; 10.1016/j.nicl.2014.05.020; 10.1016/j.nicl.2018.07.027; 10.1002/ana.22631; 10.1016/j.dadm.2017.11.007; 10.1016/j.jalz.2011.03.008; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.02.046; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.01.064; 10.1161/01.cir.0000437741.48606.98; 10.3174/ajnr.A4299; 10.18637/jss.v059.i05; 10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101904; 10.1001/archneur.1997.00550230066019; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.10.008; 10.1038/nn.2724; 10.2105/AJPH.2012.300865; 10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.12.016; 10.1038/npp.2015.171; 10.1038/nn.3983; 10.1371/journal.pone.0088969","<b>Conflict of Interest Disclosures:</b> Dr Jonaitis reported receiving grants from the National Institute on Aging and donations from the Lou Holland Fund that partially fund her position at the Wisconsin Alzheimer&#x2019;s Institute during the conduct of the study.

At the start of its third phase (2016-2021) the target group of the campaign was kept as people aged between mid-twenties and mid-forties but changed to middle-low income groups and the content was focused on men. Participants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3700) were recruited through an online market research panel, before and after each burst of the campaign. They completed an online questionnaire evaluating knowledge (Mental Health Knowledge Schedule, MAKS); attitudes (Community Attitudes toward Mental Illness, CAMI); and desire for social distance (Intended Behaviour subscale of the Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale, RIBS). Socio-demographic data and awareness of the campaign were also collected. For each of the 3 bursts, significant pre-post awareness differences were found (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.83, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.90-4.20, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.72, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.22-2.42, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002; OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.41, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.01-1.97, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.043), and awareness at the end of the third burst was 33%. Demographic factors associated with awareness for one or more bursts included having children, familiarity with mental illness, male sex, being Black, Asian or other ethnic minorities and living in London or the East Midlands regions. An improvement across bursts in the ""living with"" subscale item of the RIBS, and in the ""recover"" and ""advice to a friend"" MAKS items were found. Familiarity with mental illness had the strongest association with all outcome measures, while the awareness of the campaign was also related with higher scores in MAKS and RIBS. These interim results suggest that the campaign is reaching and having an impact on its new target audience to a similar extent as did the TTC phase 1 campaign. While over the course of TTC we have found no evidence that demographic differences in stigma have widened, and indeed those by age group and region of England have narrowed, those for socioeconomic status, ethnicity and sex have so far remained unchanged. By targeting a lower socioeconomic group and creating relatively greater awareness among men and in Black and ethnic minority groups, the campaign is showing the potential to address these persistent differences in stigma.","D000328; D005006; D005260; D007722; D006801; D008131; D008297; D001523; D008875; D008913; D011203; D015397; D012737; D040241; D057545","Adult; Ethnicity; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; London; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Minority Groups; Poverty; Program Evaluation; Sex Factors; Social Marketing; Social Stigma","-","10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.09.030; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2015.10.005; 10.1176/appi.ps.201100529; 10.1055/s-0029-1220386; 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61046-1; 10.1016/j.cpr.2010.06.004; 10.1192/bjp.bp.106.025791; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2016.08.008; 10.1192/bjp.bp.113.126672; 10.1017/S0033291718003677; 10.1037/0022-3514.90.5.751; 10.1037/a0032603; 10.1177/1368430210387805; 10.1027/0227-5910/a000517; 10.1017/S2045796011000308; 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02289; 10.1176/appi.ps.201700478; 10.1192/bjp.bp.114.151944","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Clara Gonz&#xe1;lez-Sanguino, Laura C Potts, Maria Milenova, Claire Henderson","Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."

Yet, only 3.4% of the women reported an insomnia diagnosis and 3.0% reported a sleep apnea diagnosis. In unadjusted models, poverty, Medicaid coverage, self-identifying as black, and obesity before and during pregnancy (BMI &#x2265; 35) were associated with a wide range of sleep problems. However, adjusted models revealed specificity. Poverty was uniquely related to increased insomnia symptoms and trouble sleeping due to bad dreams. Obesity before pregnancy was related to poor sleep quality, snoring, sleep aids, and short sleep. Black women reported shorter sleep duration than white women but differed on no other sleep parameters. Clinical signs of insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing are common in mid-to-late pregnancy, but most cases go undetected. Problematic sleep disproportionately affects women in poverty, who self-identify as black, and who are obese before pregnancy.

This article compares two ways of calculating a single score for a symptom cluster: a conventional, hypothesis-driven composite score versus a data-driven, reduced rank regression score that weights the symptoms based on their individual relationships with key outcomes. We conducted a secondary analysis of psychoneurological symptoms from a sample of 356 low-income mothers. Four of the psychoneurological symptoms (fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbance, and depressed mood) were measured with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; the fifth (pain) was measured using an item from the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). Mothers' function was measured using the 12-item Short Form Health Survey. The composite score was calculated by summing standardized scores for each individual psychoneurological symptom. In contrast, reduced rank regression weighted the individual symptoms using their respective associations with mothers' function; the weighted individual symptom scores were summed into the reduced rank regression symptom score. The composite score and reduced rank regression score were highly correlated at .93. The cluster of psychoneurological symptoms accounted for 53.7% of the variation in the mothers' function. Depressed mood and pain accounted for almost all the explained variation in mothers' function at 37.2% and 15.0%, respectively. The composite score approach was simpler to calculate, and the high correlation with the reduced rank regression score indicates that the composite score reflected most of the variation explained by the reduced rank regression approach in this data set. However, the reduced rank regression analysis provided additional information by identifying pain and depressed mood as having the strongest association with a mother's function, which has implications for understanding which symptoms to target in future interventions. Future studies should also explore composite versus reduced rank regression approaches given that reduced rank regression may yield different insights in other data sets.","D010054; D060825; D003863; D005221; D005260; D006801; D008875; D015233; D009035; D010146; D011203; D011788; D012893; D011795","Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; Cognitive Dysfunction; Depression; Fatigue; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Mothers; Pain; Poverty; Quality of Life; Sleep Wake Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires","F31 NR017106; T32 NR007091; T32 NR016920","10.1136/bmj.314.7085.932; 10.1188/03.ONF.601-606; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08111.x; 10.1097/01.ANS.0000286621.77139.f0; 10.1002/nur.20363; 10.1196/annals.1425.008; 10.1097/NNR.0b013e31828324c2; 10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031210-101218; 10.1016/j.outlook.2016.05.008; 10.1016/j.outlook.2015.03.001; 10.1016/j.jpain.2019.04.004; 10.1016/j.ejon.2009.09.005; 10.1037/0033-2909.108.1.50; 10.1016/j.yfrne.2018.03.001; 10.1016/j.jpain.2005.10.010; 10.1016/j.ejpain.2005.01.002; 10.1017/S0954579407070289; 10.1176/ajp.144.6.736; 10.1093/aje/kwh134; 10.1016/0047-259X(75)90042-1; 10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2014.12.014; 10.1097/NCC.0b013e318233a811; 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2007.11.011; 10.1016/j.ejon.2019.08.005; 10.2105/AJPH.2011.300210; 10.1038/ejcn.2014.96; 10.1037/dev0000062; 10.1037/1082-989X.4.1.84; 10.1097/00012272-200510000-00004; 10.1177/1099800411424204; 10.1093/jnci/djw253; 10.1037/0022-006X.74.1.99; 10.17226/21868; 10.1177/014662167700100306; 10.1007/s00520-016-3400-2; 10.4236/abcr.2013.24018; 10.1111/pcn.12529; 10.1080/14616730801900712; 10.2307/3766749; 10.1186/s12884-016-1050-5; 10.1097/AJP.0000000000000157","The authors have no conflicts of interest to report.","Rebecca E Salomon, Jamie Crandell, Keely A Muscatell, Hudson P Santos, Ruth A Anderson, Linda S Beeber","Rebecca E.

These data were used to calculate income per family unit and per family member prior to and immediately after injury. Ninety percent of the participants were men, 98% were from rural areas of Bangladesh and 58% were manual labours prior to injury. Median (interquartile range, IQR) family size was 5 (4-6) people. Prior to injury, 74% of participants were the main income earners for their families and 50% provided the only source of income for their families.

After injury, the median income (IQR) of each family member dropped to US$0 (US$0-US$18) placing 91% of families below the extreme poverty line of US$37.50 per person per month (equivalent to US$1.25 per day). In Bangladesh, SCI have profound financial implications for individuals and their families and causes extreme poverty.

There is a paucity of research using neuroimaging tools in conjunction with sensitive behavioral assays in low-income settings, which has hindered researchers' ability to explain how stunting impacts brain and behavioral development. We employed high-density EEG to examine associations among children's physical growth, brain functional connectivity (FC), and cognitive development. We recruited participants from an urban impoverished neighborhood in Dhaka, Bangladesh. One infant cohort consisted of 92 infants whose height (length) was measured at 3, 4.5, and 6&#x2009;months; EEG data were collected at 6&#x2009;months; and cognitive outcomes were assessed using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning at 27&#x2009;months. A second, older cohort consisted of 118 children whose height was measured at 24, 30, and 36&#x2009;months; EEG data were collected at 36&#x2009;months; and Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores were assessed at 48&#x2009;months. Height-for-age (HAZ) z-scores were calculated based on the World Health Organization standard. EEG FC in different frequency bands was calculated in the cortical source space. Linear regression and longitudinal path analysis were conducted to test the associations between variables, as well as the indirect effect of child growth on cognitive outcomes via brain FC. In the older cohort, we found that HAZ was negatively related to brain FC in the theta and beta frequency bands, which in turn was negatively related to children's IQ score at 48&#x2009;months. Longitudinal path analysis showed an indirect effect of HAZ on children's IQ via brain FC in both the theta and beta bands. There were no associations between HAZ and brain FC or cognitive outcomes in the infant cohort. The association observed between child growth and brain FC may reflect a broad deleterious effect of malnutrition on children's brain development. The mediation effect of FC on the relation between child growth and later IQ provides the first evidence suggesting that brain FC may serve as a neural pathway by which biological adversity impacts cognitive development.","D001459; D002675; D003071; D015331; D004569; D005260; D006130; D006801; D007223; D016014; D008297; D011203; D014944","Bangladesh; Child, Preschool; Cognition; Cohort Studies; Electroencephalography; Female; Growth Disorders; Humans; Infant; Linear Models; Male; Poverty; World Health Organization","R01 AI043596","10.1111/nure.12102; 10.1177/15648265150361S103; 10.3945/ajcn.115.123968; 10.1111/jcpp.12000; 10.1002/hbm.21030; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.06.003; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.09.053; 10.1038/s41398-019-0380-2; 10.1016/j.cortex.2019.03.005; 10.1038/s41593-018-0128-y; 10.1186/1866-1955-6-40; 10.1016/0887-8994(93)90025-8; 10.1176/appi.ajp.157.7.1170; 10.1093/jn/136.6.1570; 10.1016/S0149-7634(05)80234-9; 10.1093/jn/128.7.1224; 10.1111/mcn.12080; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61692-4; 10.1542/peds.2009-1519; 10.1126/science.1143921; 10.1038/547150a; 10.1002/hbm.20745; 10.1080/15248372.2012.691143; 10.1016/j.bbr.2008.08.049; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2019.0492; 10.1016/S2352-4642(17)30024-X; 10.1111/mcn.12584; 10.4269/ajtmh.14-0518; 10.1371/journal.pone.0215304; 10.1093/ije/dyr176; 10.1289/ehp.1104431; 10.1111/desc.12703; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.04.055; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.09.031; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.01.055; 10.1111/desc.12562; 10.1016/j.clinph.2015.03.004; 10.1093/cercor/bhy012; 10.3329/jhpn.v28i1.4520; 10.1016/S0165-0173(98)00056-3; 10.1073/pnas.1019676108; 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2013.05.007; 10.1038/nn.3641; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2272-17.2018; 10.1002/hbm.23645; 10.1016/j.bandc.2009.10.003; 10.1016/S1388-2457(02)00163-3; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60555-2; 10.1038/nn.3983; 10.1016/j.neuron.2017.09.027; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.011; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116110","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Wanze Xie, Sarah K G Jensen, Mark Wade, Swapna Kumar, Alissa Westerlund, Shahria H Kakon, Rashidul Haque, William A Petri, Charles A Nelson","Labs of Cognitive Neuroscience, Division of Developmental Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, USA."

The correlates under investigation included, demographic - age and gender; social - poverty, parent-adolescent relationship; behavioral - truancy, aggressive behavior, injury risk; psychological - depression and suicide ideation. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were then carried out on several variables identified from the 2006 Tanzanian Global School-based Health Survey (GSHS) questionnaire. Approximately seven percent of school-attending adolescents (n=144) reported having used an illicit substance at least once during their lifetime. After adding significantly associated covariates into a logistic regression model, we found that only truancy [OR= 2.29 (CI=1.07 - 4.90)], suicide ideation [OR=4.36 (2.32 - 8.19)] and parents who had checked their adolescents' homework (OR=0.56 (CI=0.32 - 1.00)] were significantly associated with reported substance use. Our results suggest that health promotion programs should simultaneously target multiple factors associated with substance use behaviors among school-attending adolescents in Dar es Salaam. They should take into account the range of psychosocial characteristics of school-attending adolescents which may be impacted by or result from substance use.","D000293; D000294; D002648; D005260; D015438; D006801; D008297; D011203; D012309; D012944; D019966; D059020; D013636","Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Child; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Poverty; Risk-Taking; Social Support; Substance-Related Disorders; Suicidal Ideation; Tanzania",NA,"NA","<b>Ethical approval:</b> Used GSHS 2006 data; additional ethical approval not required.","Anne Abio, Jurdas Sezirahiga, Laura E Davis, Michael L Wilson","Injury Epidemiology and Prevention Research Group, Turku Brain Injury Center, Division of Clinical Neurosciences, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku, Finland.

AUD is especially pronounced among men, leading to negative consequences at both individual and family levels. This study examines the experiences of problem-drinking fathers in Kenya regarding previous treatment-seeking related to alcohol use. Experiences and dynamics of the family are also explored as they pertain to treatment-seeking experiences. In Eldoret, Kenya, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 11 families with a male exhibiting problem drinking, his spouse, and one child. Thematic content analysis was used to examine themes related to barriers and facilitators to treatment. Participants only reported informal help received from family and community members; they exhibited little awareness of available formal treatments. Families were both deeply affected by alcohol use and actively involved in help-seeking. Indeed, fathers' experiences are described as help-accepting rather than help-seeking. Three overarching themes emerged from the results: poverty, people, and practices. Poverty could be a motivator to accept help to support one's family financially, but stress from lack of work also drove drinking behaviours. People were also crucial as both barriers and facilitators of help-accepting. Negative help strategies or peer influence deterred fathers from accepting help to quit. Positive motivation, social support, and stigma against drinking were motivators. Practices that were culturally salient, such as religiosity and gender roles, facilitated help acceptance. Overall, most help efforts were short-term and only lead to very short-term behaviour change. Families and communities are active in help provision for problem-drinking men in Kenya, though results confirm remaining need for effective interventions. Future interventions could benefit from recognizing the role of family to aid in treatment-engagement and attending to the importance of poverty, people, and practices in designing treatment strategies.","D000328; D000428; D000437; D002648; D005192; D005220; D005260; D006801; D007407; D007630; D008297; D009042; D010342; D011203; D057545; D012944","Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholism; Child; Family Health; Fathers; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Kenya; Male; Motivation; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Poverty; Social Stigma; Social Support","F32 MH113288; T32 MH096724","10.1371/journal.pmed.1000170; 10.1001/archinte.158.16.1789; 10.1177/002204260803800302; 10.1111/dar.12417; 10.1080/15660970412331292342; 10.1080/17441692.2014.921829; 10.1037/a0013459; 10.1080/08897070903442640; 10.1093/aje/kwq304; 10.1093/eurjhf/hfp037; 10.1080/01488376.2012.744618; 10.1037/0893-164X.18.2.113; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.04.016; 10.1177/1524838014523336; 10.1016/S0264-2751(03)00034-9; 10.1186/1747-597X-5-28; 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31590-2; 10.1081/ADA-200068459; 10.1016/j.cpr.2015.04.004; 10.1016/S0376-8716(00)00239-8; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61240-9; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000160; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.02899.x; 10.1016/j.aogh.2014.04.010; 10.1016/j.jsat.2006.01.003; 10.1017/gmh.2017.25; 10.1093/ije/dyu038; 10.1016/S0740-5472(03)00209-5; 10.1046/j.1360-0443.2000.95225112.x","Declaration: The authors report no conflicts of interest","Puja Patel, Bonnie N Kaiser, Christina S Meade, Ali Giusto, David Ayuku, Eve Puffer","Duke Global Health Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA; Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA."

Importantly, the extent to which cannabis use is associated with PA in adolescents is yet to be explored in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where there may be unique sociodemographic and environmental characteristics compared with high-income countries. Therefore, this study examined the association between PA and cannabis use among adolescents in 21 LMICs using data from the 2010-2016 Global School-based Student Health Survey. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed among a final sample of 89,777 adolescents (49.2% females) aged 12-15 years with a mean (SD) age of 13.7 (0.9) years. The overall prevalence of past (i.e., in lifetime but not in past 30 days) and current (in past 30 days) cannabis use were 1.0% and 2.9% respectively, while the prevalence of adequate PA in the past week (7 days/week of 60&#x2009;min of PA) was 16.6%. The prevalence of adequate levels of PA in past and current cannabis use was 7.3% and 6.9%, respectively. Current and past cannabis use (vs. never) were associated with a significant 0.62 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.41-0.94) and 0.43 (95%CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.30-0.63) times lower odds for achieving adequate levels of PA, respectively. The results underscore the high prevalence of low PA among adolescents in LMICs, and emphasize the need to understand behavioral factors that may affect PA levels, such as cannabis use, when designing interventions to improve health.","D000293; D002188; D002648; D003430; D003906; D015444; D005260; D015438; D006306; D006801; D008297; D000074609; D011203","Adolescent; Cannabis; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Developing Countries; Exercise; Female; Health Behavior; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Marijuana Use; Poverty","ICA-CL-2017-03-001","NA",NA,"Garcia Ashdown-Franks, Catherine M Sabiston, Davy Vancampfort, Lee Smith, Joseph Firth, Marco Solmi, Nicola Veronese, Brendon Stubbs, Ai Koyanagi","Research and Development Unit, Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de D&#xe9;u, Universitat de Barcelona, Fundaci&#xf3; Sant Joan de D&#xe9;u, CIBERSAM, Dr. Antoni Pujadas, Barcelona, 08830, Spain; ICREA, Pg.

A household survey was administered to the households of primary health clinic-attenders who were screened for depression symptoms using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire in the chronic care units of four primary health clinics in the North West province of South Africa. Univariate and multivariable regression models were used to assess whether a range of household economic measures were significant predictors of depression symptom severity; and whether depression symptom severity significantly predicted changes to household economic welfare, across a number of different economic measures using both multiple linear regression and logistic regression analyses. On univariate analysis, certain characteristics were associated with significantly worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores, namely: households in which the household head was younger, female, and unmarried; households in which the indexed patient was younger, and did not receive an education beyond primary school; increasing household size, receipt of a social grant, households living in housing constructed of metal sheet walls and households making use of a public tap as their primary water source. In addition, univariate analysis demonstrated that higher log-transformed food expenditure, lower log-transformed capacity to pay, the presence of household debt and both reducing the size or frequency of meals and drawing up retail shop accounts in response to financial distress over the past three years were associated with significantly worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that larger household sizes (p&lt;0.05), receipt of social grants (p&lt;0.05), higher food expenditure (p&lt;0.01), and drawing up retail shop accounts in response to financial distress (p&lt;0.05) were independently predictive of worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores. Inversely, increasing age of the household head (p&lt;0.05), having piped water directly into the household (as opposed to making use of a public water sources) (p&lt;0.01), and increasing capacity to pay (p&lt;0.01) were independently predictive of better (lower) PHQ-9 scores. Similarly, multivariable analysis demonstrated that worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores were independently predictive of lower household capacity to pay (p&lt;0.10) and higher food expenditure (p&lt;0.01). This study is the first of its kind in South Africa, identifying household economic factors associated with increased depression symptom severity on a continuum; and demonstrating that financial risk protection efforts are needed across this continuum. The study demonstrates that the relationship between poverty and mental health extends beyond the individual to affect household economic functioning. These findings must be included in policy considerations to achieve effective protection for vulnerable households facing the interaction of depression and adverse economic circumstances.","D000328; D003430; D003863; D005191; D005260; D006801; D007182; D016015; D008297; D008875; D015999; D013019","Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Family Characteristics; Female; Humans; Income; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; South Africa","001","10.1016/j.psc.2011.11.005; 10.1016/j.jad.2017.12.050; 10.1016/S2215-0366(16)30024-4; 10.1002/da.22711; 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61611-6; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.07.001; 10.2471/BLT.07.049403; 10.2190/986L-LHQ6-2VTE-YRRN; 10.1097/EDE.0b013e3181577654; 10.1186/s12916-015-0309-4; 10.1371/journal.pone.0088437; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001359; 10.1186/s12888-018-1642-x; 10.1016/j.jad.2014.06.003; 10.3399/bjgp08X263794; 10.1093/ije/dys122; 10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30298-0; 10.1186/s12888-019-2081-z; 10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30060-9","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Sumaiyah Docrat, Susan Cleary, Dan Chisholm, Crick Lund","Alan J.

The findings of this study suggest that there may be scope to reduce both frailty incidence and progression by trialling interventions aimed at reducing obesity and sedentary behaviour, increasing intensity of physical activity, and improving success of smoking cessation tools. Furthermore, improving educational outcomes and reducing poverty may also reduce inequalities in frailty.","D000368; D000369; D000375; D018450; D005260; D005500; D000073496; D006801; D016014; D008137; D008297; D006113","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Disease Progression; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Frailty; Humans; Linear Models; Longitudinal Studies; Male; United Kingdom","R01 AG017644","10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62167-9; 10.1016/j.jamda.2015.12.016; 10.1093/gerona/gls119; 10.1186/1471-2318-13-64; 10.1093/gerona/56.3.M146; 10.1093/aje/kwx061; 10.1186/1471-2318-8-24; 10.1186/s12916-018-1223-3; 10.1186/s12916-015-0420-6; 10.1093/gerona/62.7.738; 10.1007/s10522-017-9677-9; 10.1016/j.arr.2013.06.004; 10.1093/gerona/glu117; 10.1007/s12603-016-0685-2; 10.1016/j.jamda.2016.09.015; 10.1007/s12603-016-0828-5; 10.1007/s40520-017-0741-8; 10.1093/ageing/afp202; 10.3389/fnagi.2018.00295; 10.1093/ije/dys168; 10.1093/gerona/62.7.722; 10.1100/tsw.2001.58; 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2005.00506.x; 10.1016/j.mad.2006.12.004; 10.1093/gerona/60.8.1046; 10.1159/000088705; 10.1093/bioinformatics/btr597; 10.1037/a0022826; 10.1177/0164027504268574; 10.1038/ejcn.2009.139; 10.1007/s10433-017-0414-7; 10.1016/j.jalz.2019.04.013; 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2011.03300.x; 10.1177/0898264311428490; 10.1007/s12603-015-0634-5; 10.1002/oby.21013; 10.1007/s40520-018-0933-x; 10.1093/ije/dyz120; 10.1016/j.jamda.2013.11.008; 10.1053/j.gastro.2007.03.059; 10.1210/jc.2004-0535; 10.1097/MCO.0b013e32831c8c71; 10.1371/journal.pone.0148908; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60735-1; 10.1371/journal.pone.0170878; 10.1186/s40064-015-1357-0; 10.1186/s12877-015-0155-4; 10.3143/geriatrics.49.442; 10.1136/pgmj.2006.048587; 10.1590/1516-3180.2014.1325669; 10.1016/j.cger.2011.03.003; 10.1007/s10433-010-0141-9; 10.1093/gerona/gls166; 10.1186/s12877-015-0134-9; 10.1093/ageing/afx136; 10.1136/heartjnl-2013-304082; 10.1164/rccm.201204-0596PP; 10.1097/MD.0000000000014872; 10.1136/bmj.j5855; 10.1093/gerona/glw226; 10.1016/s0304-3959(98)00229-2; 10.1136/jnnp.2008.158444; 10.1016/j.jad.2010.10.022; 10.1016/j.pain.2013.09.005; 10.1093/ageing/afx188; 10.1136/eb-2013-101379; 10.1136/jech.2008.078428; 10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.11.009; 10.1111/j.1475-5890.2016.12109; 10.1053/euhj.1999.1990; 10.1021/jo901279g; 10.1212/01.WNL.0000069923.64550.9F; 10.1016/j.annepidem.2014.05.002; 10.1212/wnl.53.9.1942; 10.1016/S0022-3999(02)00303-3; 10.14283/jfa.2012.4; 10.1186/s12877-019-1229-5; 10.7717/peerj.4326; 10.1093/geronb/gbz004","The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Nils Georg Niederstrasser, Nina Trivedy Rogers, Stephan Bandelow","Department of Physiology, Neuroscience and Behavioural Sciences, St. George's University, St. George's, Grenada."

The current study builds on findings showing the effectiveness of depression quality improvement (QI) and delivery of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) skills provided by community health workers in reducing depression. Depression QI approaches across healthcare and social/community services in safety-net settings have shown improvements in mental wellness, mental health quality of life and depression over 12 months. Further, a randomised study showed improved depression among low-income racial/ethnic minorities enrolled in a CBT-informed resiliency class (Building Resilience and Increasing Community Hope (B-RICH)). The current protocol describes a comparativeness effectiveness study to evaluate whether predominantly low-income, SGM racial/ethnic minority adults randomised to a CBT-informed resiliency class have improvements in depressive symptoms over and above community-engaged QI resources and training only. The study approached three clusters of four to five programs serving predominantly SGM and racial/ethnic minority communities in the USA: two clusters in Los Angeles, California, and one in New Orleans, Louisiana. Clusters are comprised of one primary care, one mental health and two to three community agencies (eg, faith-based, social services/support, advocacy). All programs received depression QI training. The current study employed a community-partnered participatory research model to adapt the CBT-informed resiliency class, B-RICH+, to SGM communities. Study participants were screened and recruited in person from participating programs, and will complete baseline, 6- and 12-month survey follow-ups. Participants were depressed adults (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire &#x2265;10; &#x2265;18 years of age) who provided contact information. Enrolled participants were individually randomised to B-RICH+ or depression QI alone. Primary outcomes are depressive symptoms; secondary outcomes are mental health quality of life, mental wellness and physical health quality of life. Data collection for this study is ongoing. The current study was approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board.

Understanding what factors are related to the increased or decreased use of spanking/slapping is necessary to inform prevention. This study used a population-based sample to determine the prevalence of slapping/spanking reported by youth; the relationship between sociodemographic factors and slapping/spanking; and the extent to which parental exposures to victimization and maltreatment in childhood and current parental mental health, substance use and family circumstances, are associated with youth reports of slapping/spanking. Data were from the 2014 Ontario Child Health Study, a provincially representative sample of households with children and youth aged 4-17&#x2009;years. Self-reported lifetime slapping/spanking prevalence was determined using a sub-sample of youth aged 14-17&#x2009;years (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1883). Parents/primary caregivers (i.e., person most knowledgeable (PMK) of the youth) self-reported their own childhood experiences including bullying victimization, slapping/spanking and child maltreatment, and current mental health, substance use and family circumstances including mental health functioning and emotional well-being, alcohol use, smoking, marital conflict and family functioning. Analyses were conducted in 2018. Living in urban compared to rural residence and family poverty were associated with decreased odds of slapping/spanking. PMK childhood experiences of physical and verbal bullying victimization, spanking, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and exposure to physical intimate partner violence were associated with increased odds of youth reported slapping/spanking (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] ranged from 1.33-1.77). PMK experiences of physical abuse and exposure to emotional/verbal intimate partner violence in childhood was associated with decreased odds of youth reported slapping/spanking (AOR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.72 and 0.88, respectively). PMK's higher levels of marital conflict, languishing to moderate mental health functioning and emotional well-being, and moderate or greater alcohol use were associated with increased odds of youth reported slapping/spanking (AOR ranged from 1.36-1.61). It may be important to consider parent/primary caregiver's childhood experiences with victimization and maltreatment along with their current parental mental health, substance use and family circumstances when developing and testing strategies to prevent slapping/spanking.","D000293; D000328; D002649; D019548; D003430; D005191; D005260; D006801; D008297; D001523; D009864; D010287; D010290; D011678; D012307; D057566; D012959; D019966","Adolescent; Adult; Child Abuse; Crime Victims; Cross-Sectional Studies; Family Characteristics; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Ontario; Parent-Child Relations; Parents; Punishment; Risk Factors; Self Report; Socioeconomic Factors; Substance-Related Disorders",NA,"10.1037/0033-2909.128.4.539; 10.1037/fam0000191; 10.1503/cmaj.101314; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2006.04.006; 10.1542/peds.2011-2947; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2017.01.014; 10.1016/J.CHIABU.2017.03.016; 10.1016/J.CHIABU.2017.08.020; 10.2307/584804; 10.1177/1077559501006002004; 10.1016/J.CHILDYOUTH.2008.05.001; 10.1016/J.CHILDYOUTH.2011.04.007; 10.7870/cjcmh-2014-014; 10.1016/J.CHILDYOUTH.2018.03.003; 10.1111/j.1741-3729.2007.00441.x; 10.1016/J.CHIABU.2007.08.006; 10.1177/0886260507304550; 10.1177/0886260511432154; 10.1007/s10826-017-0929-8; 10.1542/peds.2010-1779; 10.1177/0886260510362888; 10.1503/cmaj.131792; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2008.05.003; 10.1037/0002-9432.76.3.395; 10.1037/0003-066X.62.2.95; 10.1037/0022-006X.73.3.539; 10.1111/j.1545-5300.1988.00097.x; 10.1177/0009922806292644; 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02656-8; 10.1016/J.CHILDYOUTH.2018.06.034; 10.1016/J.CHIABU.2015.01.014; 10.1016/J.CHIABU.2017.09.015; 10.2466/02.04.09.10.16.21.PR0.107.5.425-440; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00218.x; 10.1097/01.nmd.0000235789.79491.1b; 10.1016/J.CHIABU.2017.01.017","The authors declare that they have no competing interest.","Tracie O Afifi, Janique Fortier, Harriet L MacMillan, Andrea Gonzalez, Melissa Kimber, Katholiki Georgiades, Laura Duncan, Tamara Taillieu, Isabel Garces Davila, Shannon Struck","Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada."

However, most such disorders remain undiagnosed until adolescence or adulthood. Little is known about the factors that influence mental health in children and adolescents, especially in low and middle-income countries (LMIC), where environmental threats, such as poverty and war, may affect optimal neurodevelopment. Cohort studies provide important information on risks and resilience across the life course by enabling tracking of the effects of early life environment on health during childhood and beyond. Large birth cohort studies, including twin cohorts that can be aetiologically informative, have been conducted within high-income countries but are not generalisable to LMIC. There are limited longitudinal birth cohort studies in LMIC. We sought to enhance the volume of impactful research in Sri Lanka by establishing a Centre of Excellence for cohort studies. The aim is to establish a register of infant, child and adolescent twins, including mothers pregnant with twins, starting in the districts of Colombo (Western Province) and Vavuniya (Northern Province). We will gain consent from twins or parents for future research projects. This register will provide the platform to investigate the aetiology of mental illness and the impact of challenges to early brain development on future mental health. Using this register, we will be able to conduct research that will (1) expand existing research capacity on child and adolescent mental health and twin methods; (2) further consolidate existing partnerships and (3) establish new collaborations. The initiative is underpinned by three pillars: high-quality research, ethics, and patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE). Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Ethics Review Committee of Sri Lanka Medical Association and Keele University's Ethical Review Panel.

Given the high rates of release among adolescents (ie, 60% within three months and 85% within one year), there is a critical need for interventions focused on helping parents achieve and maintain effective parenting practices posttreatment. Yet, research suggests that engaging parents in aftercare services is difficult, partly due to systemic-structural and personal barriers. One way to increase parent use of aftercare services may be to offer mobile health interventions, given the potential for wide availability and on-demand access. However, it remains unclear whether mobile phone-based aftercare support for caregivers of substance-using teens is feasible or desired. Therefore, formative work in this area is needed. This study aims to determine the feasibility and acceptability of mobile phone-based aftercare support in a population of caregivers with teens in treatment for substance use. Upon enrollment in a treatment program, 103 caregivers completed a mobile phone use survey, providing information about mobile phone ownership, access, and use. Caregivers also provided a response to items assessing desire for aftercare services, in general; desire for mobile phone-based aftercare services specifically; and desire for parenting specific content as part of aftercare services. Research assistants also monitored clinic calls made to caregivers' mobile phones to provide an objective measure of the reliability of phone service. Most participants were mothers (76.7%) and self-identified as Hispanic (73.8%). The average age was 42.60 (SD 9.28) years. A total of 94% of caregivers owned a mobile phone. Most had pay-as-you-go phone service (67%), and objective data suggest this did not impede accessibility. Older caregivers more frequently had a yearly mobile contract. Further, older caregivers and caregivers of adolescent girls had fewer disconnections. Bilingual caregivers used text messaging less often; however, caregivers of adolescent girls used text messaging more often. Although 72% of caregivers reported that aftercare was needed, 91% of caregivers endorsed a desire for mobile phone-based aftercare support in parenting areas that are targets of evidence-based treatments. The results suggest that mobile phones are feasible and desired to deliver treatments that provide support to caregivers of teens discharged from substance use treatment. Consideration should be given to the age of caregivers when designing these programs. Additional research is needed to better understand mobile phone use patterns based on a child's gender and among bilingual caregivers.","D000293; D000294; D000328; D000359; D017028; D040421; D005260; D006801; D008297; D008875; D011203; D015397; D015203; D057566; D019966; D011795","Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Adult; Aftercare; Caregivers; Cell Phone; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Poverty; Program Evaluation; Reproducibility of Results; Self Report; Substance-Related Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires","KL2 TR002646","10.1016/S0306-4603(01)00247-7; 10.1007/s11920-011-0224-0; 10.1037//0022-006X.69.5.802; 10.1080/00952990903005890}; 10.1037/0893-3200.10.1.12; 10.1080/08897077.2014.925029; 10.1037/a0035041; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2009.07.009; 10.1016/j.jaac.2015.02.009; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2010.02.003; 10.1007/s00787-016-0930-6; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2017.04.017; 10.1023/A:1026429205294; 10.1111/j.1545-5300.1999.00265.x; 10.1023/B:COMH.0000022732.80714.8b; 10.1002/jclp.21951; 10.1186/1747-597X-5-19; 10.3109/16066359.2010.530711; 10.1080/10550490601003631; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2012.10.003; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.11.001; 10.1016/j.jsat.2015.06.017; 10.2196/jmir.2673; 10.1300/J029v03n01_04; 10.1097/FCH.0000000000000059; 10.1177/1524839913514441; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2013.02.018; 10.1002/j.2161-1874.2011.tb00069.x; 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2017.08.006; 10.3758/BRM.41.4.1149; 10.1177/1461444813506975; 10.1037/a0025543","Conflicts of Interest: None declared.","Stacy R Ryan-Pettes, Lindsay L Lange, Katherine I Magnuson","Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Baylor University, Waco, TX, United States."

Key challenges identified for sustainable mental health financing include the low level of funding accorded to mental health services, widespread inequalities in access and poverty, although opportunities exist in the form of new political interest in mental health and ongoing reforms to national insurance schemes. Inclusion of mental health within planned or nascent national health insurance schemes was identified as a key strategy for moving towards more equitable and sustainable mental health financing in all six countries.

Overall, there was low mental service user participation in health system strengthening at both national and district levels. Health system strengthening activities included policy development, implementation of programs and research. Informants mentioned several barriers to service user involvement in mental health system strengthening. These were grouped into three categories: institutional, community and individual level factors. Institutional level barriers included: limited funding to form, train and develop mental health service user groups, institutional stigma and patronage by founder members of user organizations. Community level barriers included: abject poverty and community stigma. Individual level barriers included: low levels of awareness and presence of self-stigma. Informants also recommended some strategies to enhance service user involvement. The Uganda Ministry of Health should develop a strategy to improve service user participation in mental health system strengthening. This requires an appreciation of the importance of service users in improving service delivery. To address the barriers to service user involvement identified in this study requires concerted efforts by the Uganda Ministry of Health and the district health services, specifically with regard to attitudes of health workers, dealing with stigma at all levels, raising awareness about the rights of service users to participate in health systems strengthening activities, building capacity and financial empowerment of service user organizations.",NA,NA,"205069/Z/16/Z","NA","Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests","James Mugisha, Charlotte Hanlon, Birthe Loa Knizek, Joshua Ssebunnya, Davy Vancampfort, Eugene Kinyanda, Fred Kigozi","Butabika National Referral and Teaching Mental Hospital, Kampala, Uganda."

Retrospective information was collected on childhood poverty, with questions including whether respondents ever experienced hunger before age 15, whether basic facilities were available, and the number of books in the childhood home. We used linear regression to examine the association between childhood conditions and cognitive function in later life. The findings show that the numbers of facilities and books available in childhood homes are substantially associated with cognition in later life after taking adulthood characteristics into account. Childhood hunger has no significant association with cognitive ability in later life. Belonging to an older birth cohort and living in a rural area were shown to have negative associations with cognitive ability in Indonesia.

Despite this, only a few multinational studies has investigated correlates of physical activity (PA) in young adolescents in this part of the world. In this study, we identified physical activity correlates using data from the Global school-based Student Health Survey. In total, 142,118 adolescents from 48 LMICs (age 13.8&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;1.0&#x202f;years; 49% girls) were included in the analyses. PA was assessed by the PACE+ Adolescent Physical Activity Measure and participants were dichotomised into those who do (60&#x202f;min of moderate-vigorous PA every day of the week) and do not comply with the World Health Organization recommendations. We used multivariable logistic regression in order to assess the correlates. The prevalence of low PA was 15.3% (95%CI&#x202f;=&#x202f;14.5%-16.1%). Boys (OR&#x202f;=&#x202f;1.64; 95%CI&#x202f;=&#x202f;1.47-1.83) and those who participated in physical education for &#x2265;5&#x202f;days/week (OR&#x202f;=&#x202f;1.12; 95%CI&#x202f;=&#x202f;1.10-1.15) were more likely to meet PA guidelines, while adolescents with food insecurity (OR&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.85; 95%CI&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.80-0.90), low fruit and vegetable intake (OR&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.68; 95%CI&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.63-0.74), low parental support/monitoring (OR&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.68; 95%CI&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.62-0.74), no friends (OR&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.80; 95%CI&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.72-0.88), and who experienced bullying (OR&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.93; 95%CI&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.86-0.99) were less likely to have adequate levels of PA. There were a few variations in the correlates depending on country-income level. Our data indicate that in adolescents aged 12 to 15&#x202f;years living in LMICs physical activity participation is a complex and multi-dimensional behavior determined by sociocultural, socio-economic, and policy-related factors.

To inform early intervention planning, this research therefore aimed to describe the health and social adversities experienced by a cohort of girls and young women in early pregnancy in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Participants were recruited for the BC Healthy Connections Project (BCHCP), a randomized controlled trial examining the effectiveness of Nurse-Family Partnership, a home visitation program, in improving child and maternal outcomes. Baseline data were collected from 739 participants on trial entry. Participants were selected on the basis of preparing to parent for the first time and experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage. Analyses involved descriptive statistics and age-group comparisons. Most participants reported having low income (84%), having limited education (52%) and being single (91%) at trial entry. Beyond these eligibility criteria, other health and social adversities included: housing instability (52%); severe anxiety or depression (47%); other diagnosed mental disorders (22%); prenatal nicotine and cannabis use (27 and 21%); physical health problems (20%); child maltreatment when younger (56%); and intimate partner violence recently (50%). As well, few (29%) had received income assistance entitlements. More than two thirds (70%) were experiencing four or more forms of adversity. Age-group differences were observed for cognitive functioning, being single, low income, limited education, psychological distress and service use (p-value &#x2264;0.05). This cohort was selected on the basis of socioeconomic disadvantage. Yet all participants were experiencing substantial added adversities - at higher rates than other Canadians. Furthermore, despite Canada's public programs, these pregnant girls and young women were not being adequately reached by social services. Our study adds new data to inform early intervention planning, suggesting that unacceptably high levels of socioeconomic disadvantage exist for some young British Columbians.

The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of delivering a psychosocial intervention targeting depression, and to develop the procedures to conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial among older adults registered with primary care clinics in poor neighbourhoods of S&#xe3;o Paulo, Brazil. We conducted a pilot study of a two-arm cluster, non-randomized controlled trial. Two primary care clinics adhering to the Family Health Strategy were allocated to either the intervention or the control arm. In the control arm, patients received enhanced usual care consisting of staff training for improved recognition and management of depression. In the intervention arm, alongside the enhanced usual care, patients received a 17-week psychosocial intervention delivered by health workers assisted with an application installed in a tablet. We randomly selected 579 of 2020 older adults registered in the intervention clinic to participate in the study. Among these individuals, 353 were assessed for depression and 40 (11.0%) scored at least 10 on the PHQ-9 and were therefore invited to participate. The consent rate was 33/40 (82%) with a resulting yield of 33/579 (5.7%). In the control arm, we randomly selected 320 older adults among 1482 registered in the clinic, 223 were assessed for depression and 28 (12.6%) scored 10 or above on the PHQ-9. The consent rate was 25/28 (89%), with a resulting yield of 25/320 (7.8%). Of the 33 who consented in the intervention arm, 19 (59.4%) completed all sessions.

Physical activity is one potential psychosocial strategy with the potential to reduce loneliness in this population. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore associations between physical activity (PA) and loneliness in middle-aged and older people from six LMICs. Data from the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) were analyzed. Self-reported data on loneliness and PA (as assessed by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire) were collected. Participants were dichotomized into those who do and do not meet the international recommendation of 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous PA per week. Associations between loneliness and PA were examined using logistic regressions. Among 34 129 individuals aged 50 years or older, the prevalence of loneliness was higher among those not meeting the PA guidelines in all countries, although this difference was not significant in Mexico and South Africa. After full adjustment, not meeting PA guidelines was positively associated with loneliness in the meta-analysis based on country-wise estimates, with a moderate level of between-country heterogeneity being observed (OR = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.07-1.61; I<sup>2</sup> = 48.7%). At an individual country level, statistical significance was only reached in Ghana (OR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.44-2.49).

However, it remains unclear how risk relates to normative changes in adolescence. Few studies have examined adolescent substance use changes before, during, and after pregnancy and considered how pregnancy outcomes (childbirth, miscarriage, abortion) differentially influence substance use changes. The present study examined associations between different adolescent pregnancy outcomes and within-person changes in substance use from prepregnancy to postpregnancy. Participants included 2,450 girls (52% Black) oversampled from low-income urban neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, PA. Participants self-reported pregnancy outcomes and substance use frequency (alcohol, cigarette, marijuana) annually from ages 11-20. Fixed effects regressions focused on first births, first miscarriages, and first abortions occurring from ages 12-19 to test the associations between pregnancy outcomes and within-individual changes in substance use from prepregnancy to postpregnancy. By design, models controlled for all potential time-stable confounds,&#xa0;and models included age and subsequent pregnancies as time-varying covariates. Consistent with prior studies, girls who became pregnant (20%) reported greater early risk for substance use problems than never-pregnant adolescents, including earlier age of onset and more regular marijuana and cigarette use. Childbirth predicted a 26%-51% within-individual reduction in alcohol, marijuana, and cigarette use that remained significantly lower than prepregnancy levels after childbirth. Alcohol and marijuana use decreased (32%-47%) after miscarriage. Abortion was not associated with long-term changes in substance use; however, marijuana and cigarette use gradually increased (44%-46%) in the years leading up to the year of and after abortion, respectively, before returning to prepregnancy levels. Findings highlight important differences in adolescent substance use patterns based on pregnancy outcome. For pregnant adolescents with heightened pre-existing risk for substance use, pregnancy may be a window of opportunity for substance use screening and behavioral intervention.","D000028; D000022; D000293; D000294; D000328; D002648; D000073865; D005260; D006801; D036801; D011203; D011247; D011253; D019966; D000066608; D014481; D055815","Abortion, Induced; Abortion, Spontaneous; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Adult; Child; Cigarette Smoking; Female; Humans; Parturition; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy in Adolescence; Substance-Related Disorders; Underage Drinking; United States; Young Adult","T32 AA007453; K01 MH071790; UH3 OD023244; R01 HD067185; R01 MH056630; R01 DA012237","10.1089/jwh.2007.0505; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2013.02.004; 10.2174/157340409788185785; 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.077230; 10.1111/dar.12152; 10.1111/j.1365-3016.2009.01036.x; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.09.014; 10.1177/0004867413484597; 10.1007/s00148-011-0381-9; 10.1016/S1054-139X(96)00052-3; 10.1002/cbm.489; 10.1080/08897077.2016.1268240; 10.1016/1054-139X(91)90007-K; 10.1080/15374416.2010.486320; 10.1007/s00737-009-0063-8; 10.1016/j.whi.2014.11.008; 10.1037/a0017497; 10.1177/002204268401400206; 10.15288/jsad.2018.79.293; 10.1111/acer.12544; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2015.01.039; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.09.007; 10.1037/a0018518; 10.1017/S0954579410000544; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.10.006; 10.1016/j.contraception.2012.03.012; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2016.10.006","Conflict of interest statement: No conflicts declared.","Irene Tung, Jordan Beardslee, Dustin Pardini, Tammy Chung, Kate Keenan, Alison E Hipwell","Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."

The function of this neural circuit is altered by negative life experiences, which can potentially affect threat-related emotional processes. Notably, Black-American individuals disproportionately endure negative life experiences compared to White-American individuals. However, the relationships among negative life experiences, race, and the neural substrates that support threat-related emotional function remains unclear. Therefore, the current study investigated whether the brain function that supports threat-related emotional processes varies with racial differences in negative life experiences. In the present study, adolescent violence exposure, family income, and neighborhood disadvantage were measured prospectively (i.e., at 11-19 years of age) for Black-American and White-American volunteers. Participants then, as young adults (i.e., 18-23 years of age), completed a Pavlovian fear conditioning task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Cued and non-cued threats were presented during the conditioning task and behavioral (threat expectancy) and psychophysiological responses (skin conductance response; SCR) were recorded simultaneously with fMRI. Racial differences were observed in neural (fMRI activity), behavioral (threat expectancy), and psychophysiological (SCR) responses to threat. These threat-elicited responses also varied with negative life experiences (violence exposure, family income, and neighborhood disadvantage). Notably, racial differences in brain activity to threat were smaller after accounting for negative life experiences. The present findings suggest that racial differences in the neural and behavioral response to threat are due, in part, to exposure to negative life experiences and may provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying racial disparities in mental health.","D000293; D001741; D001921; D002648; D003214; D000069581; D005239; D005260; D054624; D006801; D008016; D008279; D008297; D011203; D044465; D055815","Adolescent; Black or African American; Brain; Child; Conditioning, Classical; Exposure to Violence; Fear; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Life Change Events; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Poverty; White People; Young Adult","U19 DP002664; U48 DP000046; U48 DP000057; U19 DP002663; U48 DP000056; R01 MH098348; T32 MH100019; U19 DP002665","10.1016/j.cpr.2009.12.008; 10.1016/j.pain.2014.05.015; 10.1196/annals.1417.016; 10.1038/nn.2242; 10.1111/j.1469-8986.2012.01384.x; 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000369; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.01.047; 10.1073/pnas.0800374105; 10.1037/0735-7044.120.5.1187; 10.1016/j.neuron.2008.06.029; 10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.141409; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.11.042; 10.1016/j.tics.2010.11.004; 10.1038/mp.2015.88; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.11.021; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.03.030; 10.1016/j.bandc.2013.04.005; 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00277; 10.3758/s13415-012-0142-6; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.07.034; 10.1186/2045-5380-2-9; 10.1001/archpsyc.62.6.593; 10.1073/pnas.1308240110; 10.1037/a0024324; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.03.020; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.11.015; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.07.012; 10.3791/3083; 10.1111/psyp.12909; 10.1146/annurev.neuro.24.1.897; 10.1016/j.cub.2011.10.015; 10.1007/s10802-007-9128-1; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.06.026; 10.1111/j.1755-5949.2010.00152.x; 10.1080/00221309.1976.9710867; 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2010.10.015; 10.1038/npp.2014.75; 10.1016/j.acap.2012.04.005; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.08.005; 10.1093/phr/116.5.404; 10.1016/j.amepre.2004.04.007; 10.1037/a0036636; 10.2174/1874440001307010041; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.12.048; 10.1001/archpsyc.62.5.554; 10.2105/AJPH.2012.300931",NA,"Nathaniel G Harnett, Muriah D Wheelock, Kimberly H Wood, Adam M Goodman, Sylvie Mrug, Marc N Elliott, Mark A Schuster, Susan Tortolero, David C Knight","Department of Psychology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA."

The present study aims to assess the rates, characteristics and risk factors of aggressive behavior in first episode psychosis patients (FEP). We conducted a retrospective chart review of 449 FEP patients recruited from an outpatient early psychosis clinic. Aggressive behavior and clinical information were rated based upon information gathered from the chart review of data collected at baseline and after 6&#x202f;months of follow-up. Rates of aggressive behavior were 54.3% in FEP patients. Aggressive behavior was significantly associated with higher rates of history of birth complications, neurodevelopmental delays, learning difficulties, alcohol use disorders, and the clinical domain of poverty symptoms. In addition to aggressive behavior, 16.7% of FEP patients exhibited suicidal ideation or behaviors and 11.4% exhibited non-suicidal self-injurious behavior (NSSIB). In contrast to baseline, aggressive behaviors at 6&#x202f;months follow up were almost entirely absent. Patients at early stages of psychosis have high rates of aggressive and suicidal behavior prior to contact with clinical services.

The aim of the study was to explore the socio-economic status of households with a person with severe mental disorder (SMD; psychosis or bipolar disorder) or depression compared to households without an affected person. A population-based, comparative, cross-sectional household survey was conducted in Sodo district, south Ethiopia, between January and November 2015. Two samples were recruited, each with its own comparison group. Sample (1): households of 290 community-ascertained persons with a clinician-confirmed diagnosis of SMD and a comparison group of 289 households without a person with SMD. Sample (2): households of 128 people who attended the primary health care centre and who were identified by primary care staff as having a probable diagnosis of depressive disorder; and comparison households of 129 patients who attended for other reasons and who did not receive a diagnosis of depression. Household socioeconomic status (household income, consumption and asset-based wealth) was assessed using a contextualized version of theWorld Health Organization (WHO) Study on global Ageing and adult health (SAGE) questionnaire. Each disorder group (SMD and depression) was further divided into higher and lower disability groups on the basis of median score on the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule. Households of a person with SMD who had higher disability were more likely to have a poorer living standard (no toilet facility; p&#xa0;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Having a reliable source of regular income was significantly lower in households of a person with SMD (p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.008) or depression (p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.046) with higher disability than the comparison group. Households of persons with SMD with higher disability earned less (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005) and owned significantly fewer assets (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) than households without SMD.

Yet, no published work has assessed how these factors affect early brain development in developing countries. This pilot study examined effects of maternal psychopathology and education on early neurocognitive development in a sample of adolescent mothers (N&#xa0;= 50, final n&#xa0;= 31) and their infants living in poverty in S&#xe3;o Paulo, Brazil. Maternal symptoms of anxiety, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and education level were assessed during pregnancy. Infant neurocognitive development was assessed at 6 months of age, with oscillatory power and functional connectivity in the theta (4-6 Hz), alpha (6-9 Hz), and gamma (30-50 Hz) frequencies derived from resting-state electroencephalography; temperament (negative affect, attention, and regulation); and cognitive, language, and motor skills. Cluster-based permutation testing and graph-theoretical methods were used to identify alterations in oscillatory power and connectivity that were associated with maternal psychopathology and education. Correlations between power and connectivity alterations were examined in relation to infants' overt cognitive behavioral abilities. Increased maternal anxiety and lower maternal education were associated with weaker oscillatory connectivity in alpha-range networks. Infants with the weakest connectivity in the alpha network associated with maternal anxiety also showed the lowest cognitive ability. Greater maternal anxiety and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were associated with increased absolute and relative theta power. Our findings highlight the importance of addressing maternal psychopathology and improving education in poor adolescent mothers to prevent negative effects on infant neurodevelopment.","D000293; D001007; D001008; D001288; D001289; D001938; D002657; D003863; D003866; D005260; D006801; D007223; D009035; D010865; D011599; D055815","Adolescent; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Attention; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Brazil; Child Development; Depression; Depressive Disorder; Female; Humans; Infant; Mothers; Pilot Projects; Psychopathology; Young Adult",NA,"NA",NA,"Elizabeth Shephard, Daniel Fatori, Larissa Rezende Mauro, Mauro V de Medeiros Filho, Marcelo Q Hoexter, Anna M Chiesa, Lislaine A Fracolli, Helena Brentani, Alexandre A Ferraro,  ..., Guilherme V Polanczyk","Department of Psychiatry, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de S&#xe3;o Paulo, S&#xe3;o Paulo, Brazil."

A comparative cross-sectional survey was conducted, including 128 households of persons with depression and 129 households without. Depression screening was conducted using the Patient Health Questionnaire, nine item version (PHQ-9). People in the depression group were classified into high and low disability groups based on the median value on the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) polytomous summary score. Health expenditure greater than thresholds of 10 and 25% of total household consumption was used for the primary analyses. The poverty headcount, poverty gap and normalized poverty gap were estimated using retrospective recall of total household expenditure pre- and post-OOP payments for health care. Linear probability model using binreg command in STATA with rr option was used to estimate risk ratio for the occurrence of outcomes among households with and without depression based on level of disability. Catastrophic OOP payments at any threshold level for households with depression and high disability were higher than control households.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the research productivity of low-income countries (LICs) and low- to middle-income countries (LMICs) in selected journals representing the worldwide neurosurgical data and their ability to report and communicate globally the existing differences between high-income countries (HICs) and LMICs. We performed a retrospective bibliometric analysis using PubMed and Scopus databases to record all the reports from 2015 to 2017 by investigators affiliated with neurosurgical departments in LICs and LMICs. A total of 8459 reports by investigators self-identified as members of neurosurgery departments worldwide were identified. Of these, 6708 reports were included in accordance with our method in the final analysis. The systematic search resulted in 459 studies reported by LICs and LMICs. Of these, 334 reports were included for the full text evaluation. Of the 6708 reports, 303 (4.52%) had been reported with an LMIC affiliation and only 31 (0.46%) with an LIC. The leading countries were India with 182 (54.5% among LMICs and LICs; 2.71% overall), followed by Egypt at 66 (19.76% among the LMICs and LICs; 0.98% overall), with a large difference compared with other countries such as Uganda at 9 (2.69% among the LMICs and LICs) and Tunisia and Pakistan at 8 each (2.4% among the LMICs and LICs). A few reports studies had been generated by collaboration with HIC neurosurgeons. Our results have shown that research studies from LMICs are underrepresented. Understanding and discussing the reasons for this underrepresentation are necessary to start addressing the disparities in neurosurgical research and care capacity. Future engagements from international journals, more partnership collaboration from HICs, and tailored funding to support investigators, collaborations, and networks could be of help.","D015706; D000078332; D003906; D006801; D019635; D011203; D058028; D012189","Bibliometrics; Data Analysis; Developing Countries; Humans; Neurosurgical Procedures; Poverty; Research Report; Retrospective Studies",NA,"NA",NA,"Franco Servadei, Maria Pia Tropeano, Riccardo Spaggiari, Delia Cannizzaro, Asra Al Fauzi, Abdul Hafid Bajamal, Tarik Khan, Angelos G Kolias, Peter J Hutchinson","National Institute for Health Research Global Health Research Group on Neurotrauma, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Addenbrooke's Hospital and University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."

Guided by a life span model of pregnancy health and stress sensitization theories, this study investigated the influence of intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy on the association between childhood adversity and prenatal emotional distress. Participants included an urban, community-based sample of 200 pregnant women (aged 18-24) assessed annually from ages 8 to 17 for a range of adversity domains, including traumatic violence, harsh parenting, caregiver loss, and compromised parenting. Models tested both linear and nonlinear effects of adversity as well as their interactions with IPV on prenatal anxiety and depression symptoms, controlling for potential confounds such as poverty and childhood anxiety and depression. Results showed that the associations between childhood adversity and pregnancy emotional distress were moderated by prenatal IPV, supporting a life span conceptualization of pregnancy health. Patterns of interactions were nonlinear, consistent with theories conceptualizing stress sensitization through an ""adaptive calibration"" lens. Furthermore, results diverged based on adversity subdomain and type of prenatal IPV (physical vs. emotional abuse). Findings are discussed in the context of existing stress sensitization theories and highlight important avenues for future research and practice.","D000293; D000328; D002648; D004644; D005260; D006801; D000066511; D011247; D037841; D011446; D000079225; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Emotions; Female; Humans; Intimate Partner Violence; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Prospective Studies; Psychological Distress; Young Adult","T32 AA007453; K01 MH071790; UH3 OD023244; R01 HD067185; R01 MH056630; R01 DA012237","10.1007/s00737-015-0515-2; 10.1016/jjpeds.2013.01.036; 10.1089/jwh.2014.4872; 10.1007/s00406-005-0624-4; 10.1371/journal.pone.0127650; 10.1007/s10995-007-0191-6; 10.1037/a0029235; 10.1037/0033-2909.112.3.461; 10.1521/soco.1999.17.2.209; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.04.025; 10.1001/archinternmed.2009.292; 10.1017/S0954579405050145; 10.1177/0956797612471954; 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2009.09.006; 10.1038/s41398-017-0032-3; 10.1016/S0749-3797(03)00211-3; 10.1016/jxhiabu.2009.09.020; 10.1016/j.acap.2010.04.003; 10.1037/1082-989X.6A330; 10.1016/j.amepre.2015.02.001; 10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.08.019; 10.2307/1448881; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.11.007; 10.1037/a0026519; 10.1097/YC0.0b013e3283503680; 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00571.x; 10.1017/S0954579416000985; 10.1037/0003-066X.59.2.77; 10.1016/S0749-3797(98)00017-8; 10.1207/S15374424JCCP3003_9; 10.1037/a0037723; 10.1037/a0025629; 10.1016/jjpsychores.2006.04.014; 10.1016/jjad.2017.11.065; 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2008.08.013; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00218.x; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2010.04.024; 10.1016/S2468-2667(17)30118-4; 10.1038/npp.2014.165; 10.3109/10253890.2011.577848; 10.1521/pdps.2013.4L2.277; 10.1002/2327-6924.12215; 10.1007/s40653-018-0237-5; 10.1016/S0160-2527(01)00080-2; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2016.12.001; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.10.018; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2014.04.002; 10.1177/1077801205285106; 10.1177/1077559516659556; 10.1017/S0033291709992121; 10.1177/0963721416655883; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.10.012; 10.1073/pnas.1423363112; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2013.07.011; 10.1177/1077559516679513; 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2004.00307.x; 10.1016/S0749-3797(03)00090-4; 10.1371/journal.pone.0181522; 10.1016/j.cpr.2015.04.004; 10.1177/1524838009339758; 10.1016/jjpsychires.2017.09.020; 10.1089/jwh.2006.15.599; 10.1176/appi.ajp.162.2.291; 10.3102/10769986031004437; 10.1111/jcpp.12621; 10.1177/1069397105284395; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2014.02.007; 10.1196/annals.1376.002; 10.1017/S0954579412000028; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2012.02615.x; 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2010.10.015; 10.1016/S2468-2667(17)30104-4; 10.1037/a0021344; 10.1016/jjad.2018.11.033; 10.1007/s10802-015-0021-z; 10.1007/s10964-018-0977-4; 10.1111/j.1745-9125.2000.tb00883.x; 10.1177/1087054707299402; 10.1177/019251396017003001; 10.1016/S0145-2134(97)00174-9; 10.1016/j.avb.2009.07.013; 10.1016/j.ssresearch.2010.09.009; 10.1016/j.physbeh.2005.08.042; 10.1016/j.ynstr.2014.11.002; 10.1016/jjflm.2017.05.016; 10.1177/0886260510365857",NA,"Irene Tung, Kate Keenan, Stephanie D Stepp, Alison E Hipwell","Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."

This is a secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial among 384 women living in Khayelitsha, a low income setting in South Africa, recruited at their first antenatal visit if they scored 13 or above on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, were at least 18&#x2009;years of age, less than 29&#x2009;weeks pregnant and spoke isiXhosa. Participants were followed up at 8&#x2009;months gestation, 3 and 12&#x2009;months postpartum. Latent trajectories of depressive symptoms were identified using growth mixture modelling, based on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). There were no differences in HDRS scores between the control and intervention arms, so all participants were assessed together. Health, social and economic predictors of trajectories were investigated to identify high-risk groups with greater or more chronic depressive symptoms, using univariate logistic regression. Two trajectories were identified: antenatal only (91.4%), with moderate to severe symptoms at baseline which later subside; and antenatal and postnatal (8.6%), with severe depressive symptoms during pregnancy and later in the postpartum period, which subside temporarily to moderate levels at 3&#x2009;months postpartum. Predictors for the antenatal and postnatal trajectory include severe food insecurity, intimate partner violence, lower social support, greater functional impairment, problematic drinking and suicide risk. A small proportion of women who are at risk for depression antenatally remain at risk throughout the perinatal period, and can be differentiated from those who show a natural remission. Identification and referral strategies should be developed with these findings in mind, especially given the limited mental health resources in low-income settings.","D000328; D003863; D019052; D005260; D006801; D011203; D011247; D011248; D011379; D011569; D018570; D012307; D013019","Adult; Depression; Depression, Postpartum; Female; Humans; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prognosis; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; South Africa","U19 MH095699","NA","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Emily C Garman, Marguerite Schneider, Crick Lund","Alan J Flisher Centre for Public Mental Health, Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa."

This study aimed to estimate the incidence and intensity of catastrophic out-of-pocket (OOP) payments and coping strategies implemented by households with and without a person with SMD in a rural district of Ethiopia. A comparative cross-sectional community household survey was carried out from January to November 2015 as part of the Emerald programme (emerging mental health systems in low- and middle-income countries). A sample of 290 households including a person with SMD and 289 comparison households without a person with SMD participated in the study. An adapted and abbreviated version of the World Health Organization SAGE (Study on global Ageing and adult health) survey instrument was used. Households were considered to have incurred catastrophic health expenditure if their annual OOP health expenditures exceeded 40% of their annual non-food expenditure. Multiple logistic regression was used to explore factors associated with catastrophic expenditure and types of coping strategies employed. The incidence of catastrophic OOP payments in the preceding 12&#xa0;months was 32.2% for households of a person with SMD and 18.2% for comparison households (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006). In households containing a person with SMD, there was a significant increase in the odds of hardship financial coping strategies (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001): reducing medical visits, cutting down food consumption, and withdrawing children from school. Households of a person with SMD were also less satisfied with their financial status and perceived their household income to be insufficient to meet their livelihood needs (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Catastrophic OOP health expenditures in households of a person with SMD are high and associated with hardship financial coping strategies which may lead to poorer health outcomes, entrenchment of poverty and intergenerational disadvantage.

This is especially pertinent considering the established relationship between mental illness and poverty and the need to ensure the financial risk protection of persons with mental disorders and their families as part of country's efforts to attain universal health coverage. This study set out to review the health and socio-economic contexts of Nigeria as well as to generate strategies for sustainable mental health financing that will be feasible, within the specific context of the country. A multi-methods approach was developed and applied, consisting of three steps: a situational analysis of Nigeria's health system, macro-fiscal economic profile, and socio-political status, including a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis of the Nigerian socio-economic, general and mental health context; key informant interviews with 12 expert stakeholders drawn from state and non-state actors in the health and financial sectors; and a policy analysis of sustainable financing options. Key challenges identified were: poor funding; reduced access to care, resulting in a huge treatment gap; and out of pocket payment for services-leading to impoverishment. Comprehensive coverage of mental health conditions within the ongoing health insurance reforms was identified as a key strategy for moving towards sustainable mental health financing in Nigeria. Other identified strategies include enhanced integration of mental health into primary care; incorporation of mental health into other strategic and currently funded programmes; adoption of performance-based financing measures; and renewed engagement with stakeholders, including external donor institutions. A suite of feasible and actionable measures can be implemented to increase mental health service financing, reduce health-related financial burden on households, increase help-seeking and access to quality mental health care and, ultimately, reduce the large treatment and financing gap for mental disorders in Nigeria.",NA,NA,"001","10.1001/jama.291.21.2581; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.04.027; 10.1093/heapol/czl003; 10.1093/heapol/czl004; 10.2105/AJPH.89.9.1315; 10.1007/s00127-012-0587-5; 10.1186/s12916-015-0309-4; 10.1017/S2045796016000408; 10.1192/bjp.188.5.465; 10.1186/s12913-015-0911-3","Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Jibril Abdulmalik, Saheed Olayiwola, Sumaiyah Docrat, Crick Lund, Dan Chisholm, Oye Gureje","1Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."

Mental and cognitive disorders are associated with dependence but little is known about their role in the pathway to dependence in the context of multimorbidity. This study aims to determine (1) the association of multimorbidity with the onset of care dependence in older adults, accounting for mortality and controlling for sociodemographic factors, and (2) the independent effects of physical multimorbidity, mental and cognitive disorders. A population-based cohort study of people aged 65&#x2009;years and older in six countries in Latin America, and China. Data on chronic conditions and sociodemographic factors were collected at baseline. Multimorbidity was ascertained as a count of up to 15 mental, cognitive and physical health conditions. Dependence was ascertained through informant interviews at baseline and follow-up. We used competing risk regression to assess the association between multimorbidity and the onset of care dependence, acknowledging the possibility of dependence-free death. We also assessed the independent effects of physical multimorbidity and depression, anxiety and dementia individually. 12,965 participants, with no needs for care at baseline, were followed up for a median of 3.0-4.9&#x2009;years. Each unit increase in multimorbidity count increased the cumulative risk of dependence by 20% in the fully adjusted model. Age was the only variable to confound this relationship. Physical multimorbidity was associated with only a modest increased risk of care dependence. Dementia, depression and anxiety were independently associated with incident care dependence at every level of physical multimorbidity, and depression and anxiety attenuated the effect of physical multimorbidity. Multimorbidity consistently predicts care dependence with little variation between countries. Physical multimorbidity imparts a lower risk than multimorbidity with mental and cognitive disorders included. Mental and cognitive disorders independently increase the risk of care dependence. Comprehensive and holistic assessment of disorders of body, brain and mind can help to identify older people at high risk of care dependence.","D000368; D000369; D001007; D017028; D002681; D002908; D003072; D015331; D003704; D003863; D003906; D005260; D006801; D007182; D007843; D008137; D008297; D000076322; D011203; D012044","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety; Caregivers; China; Chronic Disease; Cognition Disorders; Cohort Studies; Dementia; Depression; Developing Countries; Female; Humans; Income; Latin America; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Multimorbidity; Poverty; Regression Analysis","IIRG-04-1286; GR080002; GR066133","10.1016/j.arr.2011.03.003; 10.1186/s12916-015-0402-8; 10.7326/0003-4819-139-5_Part_2-200309021-00015; 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61347-7; 10.1186/s12875-015-0345-3; 10.1186/1471-2318-10-53; 10.1371/journal.pone.0195567; 10.1136/bmjspcare-2013-000639; 10.1186/1471-2458-8-285; 10.1111/ggi.12480; 10.1111/jgs.14868; 10.1186/s12916-015-0378-4; 10.1186/s12877-015-0130-0; 10.1186/1471-2318-14-67; 10.1093/gerona/glv128; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60240-2; 10.1371/journal.pone.0015941; 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61002-8; 10.1192/bjp.185.5.429; 10.1017/S0033291711000444; 10.1001/jama.294.22.2879; 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.083915; 10.1002/1099-1166(200006)15:6&lt;521::AID-GPS182&gt;3.0.CO;2-F; 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.02767.x; 10.1371/journal.pone.0127199; 10.1186/1472-6963-11-153; 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61611-6; 10.1371/journal.pone.0177044; 10.1186/s12875-015-0344-4; 10.1371/journal.pone.0142123; 10.1111/jgs.14718; 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30403-8; 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30402-6; 10.1371/journal.pone.0138521; 10.1093/gerona/63.3.298; 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61596-8","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","Jianan Bao, Kia-Chong Chua, Matthew Prina, Martin Prince","Health Service and Population Research, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."

Participants in 2015 had significantly higher rates of never being treated, taking antipsychotic drugs and ever being admitted to hospital, and lower rates of using traditional Chinese medicine or being treated by traditional/spiritual healers. The factors strongly associated with never being treated included worse mental status (symptoms/social functioning), older age, having no family caregivers and poor family economic status. Socioeconomic development influences the treatment status of people with SMI in contemporary rural China. Relative poverty, having no family caregivers and older age are important factors associated with a worse treatment status.

However, poverty does not alter brain development directly, but acts through associated biological or psychosocial risk factors (e.g. malnutrition, family conflict). Yet few studies have investigated risk factors in the context of infant neurodevelopment, and none have done so in low-resource settings such as Bangladesh, where children are exposed to multiple, severe biological and psychosocial hazards. In this feasibility and pilot study, usable resting-state fMRI data were acquired in infants from extremely poor (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;16) and (relatively) more affluent (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;16) families in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) was estimated using bilateral seeds in the amygdala, where iFC has shown susceptibility to early life stress, and in sensory areas, which have exhibited less susceptibility to early life hazards. Biological and psychosocial risk factors were examined for associations with iFC. Three resting-state networks were identified in within-group brain maps: medial temporal/striatal, visual, and auditory networks. Infants from extremely poor families compared with those from more affluent families exhibited greater (i.e. less negative) iFC in precuneus for amygdala seeds; however, no group differences in iFC were observed for sensory area seeds.

Given that these behaviors have been linked to adverse health outcomes among adolescents, this presents a new but rapidly growing challenge to human health in these under-resourced nations. However, very little is known about the associations between SB and fast food or soft drink consumption among adolescents in LMICs. Thus, data from the Global school-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) were cross-sectionally analyzed in 133,555 adolescents aged 12-15&#x2009;years from 44 LMICs [mean (SD) age 13.8 (1.0) years; 49% females]. The data were collected in the form of self-report questionnaires. Associations were assessed with multivariable logistic regression analysis and meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of fast food consumption (at least once in previous 7&#x2009;days) and carbonated soft drink consumption (at least once per day during past 30&#x2009;days) were 49.3 and 43.8%, respectively. The overall pooled estimates based on a meta-analysis with random effects for the association of &#x2265;3&#x2009;h/day of SB with fast food consumption and soft drink consumption using country-wise estimates were OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.35 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.27-1.43, I<sup>2</sup>&#xa0;=&#x2009;62.1%).) and OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.26 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.19-1.34; I<sup>2</sup>&#xa0;=&#x2009;54.3%), respectively.

Food insecurity is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon that is not appropriately captured by conventional proxy indicators currently used to assess the problem in developing countries. Ethiopia like many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, continues to experience high levels of drought driven food insecurity despite decades of implementing poverty alleviation and prevention programmes. These persistent droughts, combined with the devastating impact of climate change continue to threaten the livelihoods of thousands of men, women and children, who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. The overall objective of this study was to assess and analyze the drought driven food insecurity situation, malnutrition and derive policy implications in the Afar National Regional State of Ethiopia. Mixed methods designs which include both qualitative and quantitative were used. The subjects of the study were men and women dwellers, government officials and other stakeholders in Afar Regional State of Ethiopia. Four Hundred Twenty Two (422) eligible households were enrolled consecutively from randomly selected two Districts in Afar National Regional State of Ethiopia which were selected by stratified Randomized method. The Districts were randomly allocated into 3 Keble's from Amibara and 2 Keble's from Awash Fentale. Two FGD (total of 10 FGDs participants that mean each Districts = 5 FGD) and 10 KIIs from Amibara and Awash Fentale were conducted.

Data come from the 2014 Ontario Child Health Study-a provincially representative survey of 6537 families with 10,802 four- to 17-year-olds. Multivariate multilevel modelling was used to test if neighbourhood poverty and antisocial behaviour interact with household poverty to modify associations with children's externalizing and internalizing problems based on parent assessments of children (4- to 17-year-olds) and self-assessments of youth (12- to 17-year-olds). Based on parent assessments, neighbourhood poverty, and antisocial behaviour modified associations between household poverty and children's mental health problems. Among children living in households below the poverty line, levels of mental health problems were 1) lower when living in neighbourhoods with higher concentrations of poverty and 2) higher when living in neighbourhoods with more antisocial behaviour. These associations were stronger for externalizing versus internalizing problems when conditional on antisocial behaviour and generalized only to youth-assessed externalizing problems. The lower levels of externalizing problems reported among children living in poor households in low-income neighbourhoods identify potential challenges with integrating poorer households into more affluent neighbourhoods. More important, children living in poor households located in neighbourhoods exhibiting more antisocial behaviour are at dramatically higher risk for mental health problems. Reducing levels of neighbourhood antisocial behaviour could have large mental health benefits, particularly among poor children.

The 1983 ( n = 2836) and 2014 ( n = 5785) Ontario Child Health Studies are provincially representative cross-sectional surveys with identical self-report checklist measures of conduct disorder, hyperactivity, and emotional disorder, as well as perceived need for professional help, assessed by integrating parent and teacher responses (ages 4 to 11) and parent and youth responses (ages 12 to 16). The overall prevalence of perceived need for professional help increased from 6.8% to 18.9% among 4- to 16-year-olds. An increase in any disorder among children (15.4% to 19.6%) was attributable to increases in hyperactivity among males (8.9% to 15.7%). Although the prevalence of any disorder did not change among youth, conduct disorder decreased (7.2% to 2.5%) while emotional disorder increased (9.2% to 13.2%). The prevalence of any disorder increased more in rural and small to medium urban areas versus large urban areas. The prevalence of any disorder decreased for children and youth in immigrant but not nonimmigrant families. Although there have been decreases in the prevalence of conduct disorder, increases in other mental disorders and perceived need for professional help underscore the continued need for effective prevention and intervention programs.

A systematic review.","Children exposed to social adversity-hardship as a result of social circumstances such as poverty or intergenerational trauma-are at increased risk of poor outcomes across the life course. Understanding what promotes resilient outcomes is essential for the development of evidence informed intervention strategies. We conducted a systematic review to identify how child resilience is measured and what factors are associated with resilient outcomes. Systematic search conducted in CINAHL, MEDLINE and PsychInfo from January 2004 to October 2018 using the keywords 'resilien* and child* in the title or abstract. Eligible studies: (1) described children aged 5-12 years; (2) identified exposure to social adversity; (3) identified resilience; and (4) investigated factors associated with resilience. (1) approaches to identifying resilience and (2) factors associated with resilient outcomes. From 1979 studies retrieved, 30 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were moderate to high quality, with low cultural competency. Social adversity exposures included poverty, parent loss, maltreatment and war. Only two studies used a measure of child resilience; neither was psychometrically validated. Remaining studies classified children as resilient if they showed positive outcomes (eg, mental health or academic achievement) despite adversity. A range of child, family, school and community factors were associated with resilient outcomes, with individual factors most commonly investigated. The best available evidence was for cognitive skills, emotion regulation, relationships with caregivers and academic engagement. While there is huge variation in the type and severity of adversity that children experience, there is some evidence that specific individual, relational and school factors are associated with resilient outcomes across a range of contexts. Such factors provide an important starting point for effective public health interventions to promote resilience and to prevent or ameliorate the immediate and long-term impacts of social adversity on children.","D000069586; D006302; D006801; D008603; D055500; D012307; D064890; D012931","Adult Survivors of Child Adverse Events; Health Services Research; Humans; Mental Health; Resilience, Psychological; Risk Factors; Social Determinants of Health; Social Environment",NA,"10.1007/s00737-016-0659-8; 10.1503/cmaj.131792; 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69523-8; 10.1111/birt.12123; 10.1186/s12884-016-0867-2; 10.5694/mja12.11716; 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)74234-3; 10.1192/apt.10.3.216; 10.1111/j.1365-2214.2010.01150.x; 10.1016/j.cpr.2004.02.002; 10.1037/0022-006X.71.2.339; 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2008.01752.x; 10.1192/bjp.180.6.502; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2014.03.008; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2008.12.009; 10.1016/S2468-2667(17)30094-4; 10.1007/s10896-012-9474-9; 10.1016/S2468-2667(17)30118-4; 10.1207/s15374424jccp2304_6; 10.1001/jama.290.15.2063; 10.1023/B:PREV.0000045355.53137.45; 10.1017/S0954579411000198; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2012.02608.x; 10.1111/1467-8624.00164; 10.1177/070674371105600504; 10.1017/S095457941200003X; 10.1111/j.1939-0025.2010.01060.x; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02216.x; 10.1016/j.childyouth.2017.05.014; 10.1002/car.2258; 10.1016/j.jsp.2012.04.004; 10.1136/jech-2015-206980; 10.1186/1752-1505-8-13; 10.1016/j.jaac.2017.07.780; 10.1542/peds.2009-1100D; 10.1111/cdev.12736; 10.1016/S2468-2667(17)30139-1; 10.1111/cdoe.12058; 10.1111/j.1475-6773.2012.01410.x; 10.1111/bjdp.12028; 10.1371/journal.pone.0065041; 10.1023/A:1023056425648; 10.1016/j.pedn.2004.02.004; 10.1196/annals.1376.041; 10.1111/jcpp.12622; 10.1111/ajop.12027; 10.1017/S0954579407000399; 10.1037/0012-1649.41.2.338; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2009.01.002; 10.1207/s15374424jccp3304_3; 10.1007/s10802-013-9848-3; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2006.03.011; 10.1086/499748; 10.1093/swr/32.1.6; 10.3109/01460862.2012.678261; 10.1007/s10826-017-0904-4; 10.1111/j.1468-2397.2009.00654.x; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2011.05.009; 10.2989/16085906.2015.1052822; 10.1111/mono.12017; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2013.07.005; 10.1017/S0954579413000151; 10.1177/1524838009358892; 10.1186/1477-7525-9-8; 10.1186/s13643-017-0644-y; 10.1186/1471-2458-14-201; 10.1007/s00787-018-1115-2; 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017858; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.07.013; 10.1016/j.acap.2015.12.005","Competing interests: None declared.","Deirdre Gartland, Elisha Riggs, Sumaiya Muyeen, Rebecca Giallo, Tracie O Afifi, Harriet MacMillan, Helen Herrman, Eleanor Bulford, Stephanie J Brown","Intergenerational Health, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."

Hence, malnutrition has been persisted at alarming raters in the country. Moreover, it is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Afar National Regional State of Ethiopia. Specifically, in Amibara and Awash Fentale districts. The anthropometric data were presented on height, weight, MUAC, weight/height/Age and Body Mass Index (BMI) of under-five children. A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted from March 01, 2017 to June 15, 2018. The data was collected by using anthropometric measurement. A multi stage random sampling procedure was applied in order to recruit the required sample size. The data collections were conducted at two selected districts in Afar region by trained interviewers and health care providers. The data were analyzed by using SPSS Version 23. Bivariate analysis between dependent and independent variables was employed. Multivariate analysis was also done to control for possible confounding variable by selecting variable which show statistically significant association (P&lt; 0.05). Out of 410 under five children's anthropometric finding, the majorities (62.7%) of those registered under five children were male and (33.3%) were female. The majority (46.8%) of under five children were less than or equal to 50&#xa0;cm by their height. Most (54.1%) of under five children were less than or equal to 12.5&#xa0;cm by their MUAC. It indicated that they were diagnosed with severe malnutrition based on anthropometric measurements. Meanwhile, majority (64%) of under five children were less than 60% their weight/age. Regression analysis result indicated that all of the variables were not significant predictors of BMI for under five children (P&gt; 0.05). Based on ANOVA result, there was significant difference between sex and other predictors (P= 0.031). This finding implies that improvement in food aid and poverty alleviation programs are very important. Based on the finding, it is important to provide high quality and quantity of food. Moreover, less access to assets and health services commonly contributed for malnutrition. Highlighting under five children's malnutrition will help to develop and design future policies and programs in Ethiopia.","D000367; D000886; D001827; D015992; D001835; D002675; D003430; D005002; D005260; D006130; D006801; D007223; D007231; D008297; D044342; D015995; D012737; D013851","Age Factors; Anthropometry; Body Height; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethiopia; Female; Growth Disorders; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Malnutrition; Prevalence; Sex Factors; Thinness",NA,"NA",NA,"Mohammad Javad Hosseinzadeh-Attar, Gosaye Degu Belay, Ali Ardalan, Mohammed Assen, Effat Merghati Khoei, Abbas Ostadtaghizadeh","Department of Health in Emergencies and Disasters, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."

We aimed to describe the extent of variations in involuntary annual hospitalisation rates between countries, to compare trends over time, and to explore whether variations in legislation, demographics, economics, and health-care provision might be associated with variations in involuntary hospitalisation rates. We compared annual incidence of involuntary hospitalisation between 2008 and 2017 (where available) for 22 countries across Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. We also obtained data on national legislation, demographic and economic factors (gross domestic product [GDP] per capita, prevalence of inequality and poverty, and the percentage of populations who are foreign born, members of ethnic minorities, or living in urban settings), and service characteristics (health-care spending and provision of psychiatric beds and mental health staff). Annual incidence data were obtained from government sources or published peer-reviewed literature. The median rate of involuntary hospitalisation was 106&#xb7;4 (IQR 58&#xb7;5 to 150&#xb7;9) per 100&#x2008;000 people, with Austria having the highest (282 per 100&#x2008;000 individuals) and Italy the lowest (14&#xb7;5 per 100&#x2008;000 individuals) most recently available rates. We observed no relationship between annual involuntary hospitalisation rates and any characteristics of the legal framework. Higher national rates of involuntary hospitalisation were associated with a larger number of beds (&#x3b2; coefficient 0&#xb7;65, 95% CI 0&#xb7;10 to 1&#xb7;20, p=0&#xb7;021), higher GDP per capita purchasing power parity (&#x3b2; coefficient 1&#xb7;84, 0&#xb7;30 to 3&#xb7;38, p=0&#xb7;019), health-care spending per capita (&#x3b2; coefficient 15&#xb7;92, 3&#xb7;34 to 28&#xb7;49, p=0&#xb7;013), the proportion of foreign-born individuals in the population (&#x3b2; coefficient 7&#xb7;32, 0&#xb7;44 to 14&#xb7;19, p=0&#xb7;037), and lower absolute poverty (&#x3b2; coefficient -11&#xb7;5, -22&#xb7;6 to -0&#xb7;3, p=0&#xb7;044). There was no evidence of an association between annual involuntary hospitalisation incidence and any other demographic, economic, or health-care indicator. Variations between countries were large and for the most part unexplained. We found a higher annual incidence of involuntary hospitalisation to be associated with a lower rate of absolute poverty, with higher GDP and health-care spending per capita, a higher proportion of foreign-born individuals in a population, and larger numbers of inpatient beds, but limitations in ecological research must be noted, and the associations were weak. Other country-level demographic, economic, and health-care delivery indicators and characteristics of the legislative system appeared to be unrelated to annual involuntary hospitalisation rates. Understanding why involuntary hospitalisation rates vary so much could be advanced through a more fine-grained analysis of the relationships between involuntary hospitalisation and social context, clinical practice, and how legislation is implemented in practice.

Facilitators and facilitation methods have not been elaborated upon as well. The aim of this study is (a) to develop/evaluate the effectiveness of a structured Education-cum-Assessment Tool (EAT) in providing information regarding PADs and (b) to evaluate modes of facilitation required by patients to complete PADs.

This tool was administered to patients ( n&#x2009;=&#x2009;100), purposively sampled from the adult psychiatry review out-patient department (OPD). Patients were evaluated on retention of information, completion of PADs, modes of facilitation and time taken to write one.

The mean EAT scores implied above 70% retention but did not relate to types of facilitation. EAT scores can be used as an approximate measure of the patient's ability to understand and retain information which is a part of decisional capacity. Types of facilitation can help in understanding patient's ability to communicate their choices.

The constellation of complex, co-occurring biological, environmental, social, economic and psychological risk factors are in turn transmitted to her child, conferring vulnerability for adverse development. This study examines the association between maternal intra- and extra-familial ACEs, maternal education and the mental health of her child, mediated by maternal mental health. Mother-child dyads (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;121) in Machakos, Kenya were examined cross-sectionally using self-report measures of ACEs, maternal mental health and child internalizing and externalizing mental health problems. The four models proposed to examine the relationship between intra- and extra-familial maternal ACEs and child internalizing and externalizing problems demonstrated indirect pathways through maternal mental health. These effects were found to be conditional on levels of maternal education, which served as a protective factor at lower levels of maternal ACEs. These models demonstrate how the impact of ACEs persists across the lifespan resulting in a negative impact on maternal mental health and conferring further risk to subsequent generations. Elucidating the association between ACEs and subsequent intergenerational sequelae, especially in LMIC where risk is heightened, may improve targeted caregiver mental health programs for prevention and intervention.","D000328; D000076783; D002648; D003430; D005260; D006801; D007630; D008297; D001523; D008603; D009035; D011203; D012307; D013315","Adult; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Kenya; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Mothers; Poverty; Risk Factors; Stress, Psychological",NA,"NA",NA,"Amber D Rieder, Sophia L Roth, Christine Musyimi, David Ndetei, Roberto B Sassi, Victoria Mutiso, Geoffrey B Hall, Andrea Gonzalez","Neuroscience Graduate Program, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada."

Primary outcomes were stigmatising attitudes and discriminatory behaviours. Data collection included two strategies. First, previous systematic reviews were searched for studies that met the inclusion criteria of the current review. Second, a new search was done, covering the time since the previous reviews, i.e. January 2013 to May 2017. Five search concepts were combined in order to capture relevant literature: stigma, mental health, intervention, professional students in medicine and nursing, and LMICs. A qualitative analysis of all included full texts was done with the software MAXQDA. Full texts were analysed with regard to the content of interventions, didactic methods, mental disorders, cultural adaptation, type of outcome measure and primary outcomes. Furthermore, a methodological quality assessment was undertaken. A total of nine studies from six countries (Brazil, China, Malaysia, Nigeria, Somaliland and Turkey) were included. All studies reported significant results in at least one outcome measure. However, from the available literature, it is difficult to draw conclusions on the most effective interventions. No meta-analysis could be calculated due to the large heterogeneity of intervention content, evaluation design and outcome measures. Studies with contact interventions (either face-to-face or video) demonstrated attitudinal change. There was a clear lack of studies focusing on discriminatory behaviours. Accordingly, training of specific communication and clinical skills was lacking in most studies, with the exception of one study that showed a positive effect of training interview skills on attitudes.

A total of 33,421 participants aged&#xa0;&#x2265;&#xa0;50 years were included. A set of diagnostic questions from the World Mental Health Survey was used within SAGE to define depression. The crude population prevalence of depression was 7.4% [95%CI: 6.5%-8.3%] ranging from 1.5% in China to 15.2% in India. It was higher in females 8.6% [7.6%-9.6%] compared to males 6.1% [5.0%-7.2%]. The age-standardized prevalence of depression was 7.8% [6.3%-9.6%] in pooled data, 8.9% [6.9%-11.1%] in females and 6.6% [4.6%-9.0%] in males. Greater fruit (0.89[0.84-0.93]) and vegetable intake (0.94 [0.89-1.00]) was associated with a lower prevalence of depression. Furthermore, those who were older, female, underweight, and with lower education and lower wealth, had higher prevalence of depression. The cross-sectional design of this study precluded conclusions on causality. In nationally-representative samples of older adults in six LMICs, an average of one in every 13 participants suffered from depression. The prevalence of depression varied considerably between countries, sexes, and with wealth and educational disadvantage. Increased fruit and vegetable intake appeared to co-occur with significantly lower rates of depression, suggesting diet as a modifiable factor for addressing depression burden.","D000368; D002681; D003430; D003863; D003906; D004032; D005260; D005869; D006306; D006801; D057187; D007194; D008019; D008297; D008800; D008875; D011203; D015995; D012426; D012959; D013019; D014944","Aged; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Developing Countries; Diet; Female; Ghana; Health Surveys; Humans; Independent Living; India; Life Style; Male; Mexico; Middle Aged; Poverty; Prevalence; Russia; Socioeconomic Factors; South Africa; World Health Organization","001; R01 AG034479","NA",NA,"Mojtaba Lotfaliany, Erin Hoare, Felice N Jacka, Paul Kowal, Michael Berk, Mohammadreza Mohebbi","Biostatistics Unit, Faculty of Health, Deakin University, Geelong, Victoria, Australia."

On the contrary, financial difficulties exerted a strong and independent effect on depression (OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.16, 95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.13-1.2). Income was found to bear a strong association with suicidality only among men; whereas financial difficulties were unrelated in both genders.

The outcome was a composite measure reflecting fluid cognitive abilities. Financial hardship was assessed by markers of scarcity (being unable to heat the home, missing meals, and going without other basic needs) and behavioral responses to hardship (pawning items and seeking help from community welfare organizations). Multivariable-adjusted fixed-effect regression models for panel data with robust standard errors tested time-dependent associations between measures of financial hardship and fluid cognitive abilities. Declines in cognitive performance coincided with the experience of scarcity (&#x3b2; = -0.07; standard error, 0.018). There was no association between behavioral responses to hardship and cognitive performance, and there was no difference in the associations across age cohorts or by sex. There was no evidence that mastery or mental health attenuated the time-dependent link between hardship and cognition.

Analyses also accounted for the influence of caregiver depression, family relationship quality, and sociodemographic factors (race, income) on the relationship between behaviors and intervention engagement. Analyses were based on 118 children participating in the Coping Power intervention. Composite variables were created to represent externalizing behaviors and intervention engagement constructs. Associations between these composite variables were examined over 24 treatment sessions. Findings indicated a regressive relationship among externalizing behaviors, i.e., baseline externalizing behaviors were positively associated with immediate follow-up behaviors. There were also dynamic relationships observed among engagement constructs. Notably, engagement with in-session activities during sessions 1-8 was positively associated with out-of-session activity engagement during the same treatment time period. Engagement with out-of-session activities during sessions 1-8 was positively associated with in-session activity engagement during sessions 9-16, indicating a complete mediation between early and middle in-session engagement through the mechanism of early out-of-session engagement. A crosslag relationship was observed: middle in-session engagement was negatively associated with externalizing behaviors at immediate follow-up.

Trajectories of depressive symptoms were based on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores until 18-month postpartum, using latent class growth analysis. Child physical, cognitive, socio-emotional, and behavioural outcomes were assessed at 18 and/or 36&#xa0;months. Univariate and multivariate regressions were used to identify predictors of trajectories and differences in child outcomes. Four trajectories were identified: chronic low (71.1%), late postpartum (10.1%), early postpartum (14.4%), and chronic high (4.5%). Low social support, unwanted pregnancy, and risky drinking were associated with the chronic high trajectory; unemployment and HIV-positive status with the early postpartum trajectory; and intimate partner violence with the late postpartum trajectory. Weight-to-length and weight-for-age z-scores at 18&#xa0;months, and weight-for-age z-scores, length-for-age z-scores, emotional symptom, and peer problem scores at 36&#xa0;months differed across trajectories.

Poverty is robustly linked to adolescents' mental health problems; however, less is known about how perceptions of their social status and exposure to local area income inequality relate to mental health. Participants consisted of a population-representative sample of over 2,100 adolescents (ages 10-16), 395 of whom completed a 14-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study. Participants' subjective social status (SSS) was assessed at the start of the EMA, and mental health symptoms were measured both at baseline for the entire sample and daily in the EMA sample. Adolescents' SSS tracked family, school, and neighborhood economic indicators (|r| ranging from .12 to .30), and associations did not differ by age, race, or gender. SSS was independently associated with mental health, with stronger associations among older (ages 14-16) versus younger (ages 10-13) adolescents. Adolescents with lower SSS reported higher psychological distress and inattention problems, as well as more conduct problems, in daily life. Those living in areas with higher income inequality reported significantly lower subjective social status, but this association was explained by family and neighborhood income. Findings illustrate that adolescents' SSS is correlated with both internalizing and externalizing mental health problems, and that by age 14 it becomes a unique predictor of mental health problems.

A systematic review.","Epidemiological research suggests an interrelationship between mental health problems and the (re)occurrence of intimate partner violence (IPV). However, little is known about the impact of mental health treatments on IPV victimization or perpetration, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). We conducted a systematic review to identify prospective, controlled studies of mental health treatments in LMIC. We defined 'mental health treatment' as an intervention for individuals experiencing mental ill health (including substance misuse) including a substantial psychosocial or pharmacological component. Studies had to measure a mental health and IPV outcome. We searched across multi-disciplinary databases using a structured search strategy. Screening of title/abstracts and full-text eligibility assessments were conducted by two researchers independently, data were extracted using a piloted spreadsheet, and a narrative synthesis was generated. We identified seven studies reported in 11 papers conducted in five middle-income countries. With the exception of blinding, studies overall showed acceptable levels of risk of bias. Four of the seven studies focused on dedicated mental health treatments in various populations, including: common mental disorders in earthquake survivors; depression in primary care; alcohol misuse in men; and alcohol misuse in female adult sex workers. The dedicated mental health treatments targeting depression or alcohol misuse consistently reduced levels of these outcomes. The two studies targeting depression also reduced short-term IPV, but no IPV benefits were identified in the two alcohol-focused studies. The other three studies evaluated integrated interventions, in which a focus on substance misuse was part of efforts to reduce HIV/AIDS and violence against particularly vulnerable women. In contrast to the dedicated mental health interventions, the integrated interventions did not consistently reduce mental ill health or alcohol misuse compared to control conditions. Too few studies have been conducted to judge whether mental health treatments may provide a beneficial strategy to prevent or reduce IPV in LMIC. Key future research questions include: whether promising initial evidence on the effects of depression interventions on reducing IPV hold more broadly, the required intensity of mental health components in integrated interventions, and the identification of mechanisms of IPV that are amenable to mental health intervention.","D000293; D000328; D000368; D000369; D019548; D005260; D006801; D000066511; D008297; D001523; D008875; D011203; D011446; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Crime Victims; Female; Humans; Intimate Partner Violence; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Poverty; Prospective Studies; Young Adult","MR/S001255/1; R01 MH100470","NA","ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Not applicable.

Previous research reveals overlaps in the volumetric alterations observed in both adversity-exposed individuals and in psychosis-spectrum populations, highlighting the possibility that deviations in corticolimbic gray matter development may be one mechanism linking adversity and psychosis. Given that childhood adversity encompasses a wide range of adverse experiences, there is also a critical need to examine whether these different types of experiences have unique effects on corticolimbic regions. This study examined the association between childhood adversity and cortical, hippocampal, and amygdalar volume in a large sample of youth at clinical-high risk (CHR) for psychosis. We utilized a novel differentiated adversity approach that distinguishes exposures along dimensions of threat (e.g., abuse) and deprivation (e.g., poverty, neglect) to test for differential associations. Participants were drawn from the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study (NAPLS) and completed an MRI scan and a retrospective assessment of childhood adversity at baseline. We found that deprivation exposure, but not threat, was uniquely associated with smaller cortical volume and smaller right hippocampal volume in CHR youth. These associations were masked in a generalized risk model that utilized a total adversity score. The findings suggest that deprivation exposures during childhood contribute to the subtle volumetric reductions observed in clinical high-risk samples and highlight the importance of disentangling different dimensions of adversity.","D000293; D000076783; D002540; D002648; D002649; D005260; D006624; D006801; D008032; D008137; D008279; D008297; D011203; D011618; D012306; D055815","Adolescent; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Cerebral Cortex; Child; Child Abuse; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Limbic System; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Poverty; Psychotic Disorders; Risk; Young Adult","U01 MH081928; U01 MH081902; U01 MH081984; U01 MH082022; U01 MH081988; U01 MH081944; U01 MH081857; U01 MH076989; U01 MH082004","NA",NA,"Allison M LoPilato, Katrina Goines, Jean Addington, Carrie E Bearden, Kristin S Cadenhead, Tyrone D Cannon, Barbara A Cornblatt, Daniel H Mathalon, Thomas H McGlashan,  ..., Elaine F Walker","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Emory School of Medicine, 12 Executive Park, Atlanta, GA 30329, United States; Department of Psychology, Emory University, 36 Eagle Row, Atlanta, GA 30322, United States."

To date, most studies examining the impact of these risk factors on the development and functioning of the intestinal microbiota have primarily been conducted in high-income countries. However, arguably, children in low- and middle-income countries may be at increased risk given cumulative biological and psychosocial adversities during their development. Accumulating evidence in low- and middle-income countries has linked dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota to child health outcomes such as stunting, malnutrition, and diarrheal diseases characterized by reduced microbial diversity and elevated pathogenic bacteria, which has implications for psychosocial outcomes. This review summarizes empirical findings that highlight the association between risk factors prevalent in low- and middle-income countries and the intestinal microbiota of children. Additionally, we briefly survey the current evidence regarding the effect of nutritional interventions on the microbial composition of children in low- and middle-income countries.

Furthermore, 47.6% of all tested children between 7 and 10&#xa0;years had Ov16 antibodies. There is a decrease in epilepsy prevalence after 13&#xa0;years and more of CDTI in both villages. The age-shift observed in PWE suggests that ivermectin may prevent OAE in younger residents. Ov16 seropositivity in children indicates ongoing onchocerciasis transmission possibly due to suboptimal control measures. Our findings support the existence of OAE in Cameroon and highlight the need to strengthen onchocerciasis elimination programs.","D000293; D000328; D000977; D002163; D002648; D002675; D004827; D005260; D006801; D007223; D007559; D008297; D008875; D009855; D015995; D012189; D045483; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Antiparasitic Agents; Cameroon; Child; Child, Preschool; Epilepsy; Female; Humans; Infant; Ivermectin; Male; Middle Aged; Onchocerciasis; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Rivers; Young Adult","768815","10.1136/archdischild-2014-306237.292; 10.1016/S0035-9203(02)90433-5; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0000461; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002147; 10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2008.09.004; 10.1002/epi4.12054; 10.1016/j.pt.2017.11.009; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005732; 10.1016/j.ijid.2016.01.016; 10.1016/S0140-6736(83)91663-X; 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2009.02057.x; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005884; 10.1111/epi.12550; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02126.x; 10.1016/S1474-4422(14)70114-0; 10.1126/scitranslmed.aam8532; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003880; 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2008.01580_2.x; 10.1016/j.yebeh.2017.11.009; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005849; 10.1093/cid/ciw144; 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32844-1; 10.1093/inthealth/ihx054","ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Studies performed in Bilomo and Kelleng received approval from the Cameroon National Ethics Committee and the University of Antwerp.

Stress disproportionately affects females, who are at increased risk for stress-related pathologies associated with cognitive impairment. Mechanisms underlying stress-associated cognitive impairment and enhanced risk of females remain unknown. Here, ELS is associated with impaired rule-reversal (RR) learning in females, but not males. Impaired performance was associated with decreased expression and density of interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV+) in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), but not other interneuron subtypes. Optogenetic silencing of PV+ interneuron activity in OFC of control mice phenocopied RR learning deficits observed in ELS females. Localization of reversal learning deficits to PV+ interneurons in OFC was confirmed by optogenetic studies in which neurons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were silenced and associated with select deficits in rule-shift learning. Sex-, cell-, and region-specific effects show altered PV+ interneuron development can be a driver of sex differences in cognitive dysfunction.","D000818; D002452; D005260; D007395; D008297; D008810; D010320; D017397; D012333; D012193; D012727; D013315","Animals; Cell Count; Female; Interneurons; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Parvalbumins; Prefrontal Cortex; RNA, Messenger; Reversal Learning; Sex Characteristics; Stress, Psychological","F31 MH111131; P20 GM103645; R01 MH115049; F99 NS105219; T32 NS062443; R01 MH115914; K00 MH124183","10.1038/s41386-018-0195-5","DECLARATION OF INTERESTS.

We identified and collated all the papers related to the 10/66 Dementia Research Group, including papers from groups who adopted the 10/66 methodology, that have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Over 200 papers including data from Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean were identified by this review. Many of the findings revolved around the epidemiology of dementia, mental health and non-communicable diseases, including the cross-cultural development and validation of measurement tools of cognition and functioning, need for care, care arrangements and mental health. Social ageing, care dependence and caregiver interventions were also topics that the group had published on. A body of evidence has been generated that has challenged the view, prevalent when the group started, that dementia is comparatively rare in LMICs. The experience of the 10/66 DRG has shown that descriptive epidemiological research can be important and impactful, where few data exist.

Few studies focused on architecture and such findings were varied. The majority of studies focused on functioning with two themes emerging. First, studies demonstrate different activation in regions of interest to cognitive and behavioral tasks relative to SES. Second, when similar neurological activation is evident, they can be related to different behavioral observations relative to SES. There is also evidence of different neurological functioning associated with SES with regard to different conceptualizations and coding of SES. Further, some of the reviewed studies identified potential mediators to the relationship, such as parenting practices, stress, and IQ.

Effective care coordination was the only subcomponent of the patient-centred medical home that significantly contributed to the variance in mother's mental/emotional health and parenting stress.

This interaction may influence back pain beliefs and behaviours, and health outcomes including disability. In line with the recent Lancet Low Back Pain series call to address widespread misconceptions in the population and among health practitioners about low back pain, this study explored the beliefs and management strategies of unconventional practitioners consulted by people living with CLBP in rural Nigeria. Qualitative semi-structured face-to-face individual interviews. Thematic analysis of transcripts was performed using the Framework approach. Nine unconventional practitioners consented to participate in this study. Patent medicine sellers and herbalists had biomedical beliefs about CLBP and encouraged passivity and drug dependence in patients.

We here conducted a nonsystematic review of the neuroimaging literature studying the effects of poverty, urbanicity, and community violence, highlighting the opportunities of studying non-Western developing societies such as those in Latin America. Social and environmental factors in these communities are widespread and have a large magnitude, as well as an unequal distribution, providing a good opportunity for their characterization. Studying the effect of poverty in these settings could help to explore the brain effect of economic improvements, disentangle the effect of absolute and relative poverty, and characterize the modulating impact of poverty on the underlying biology of mental health disorders. Exploring urbanicity effects in highly unequal cities could help identify the specific factors that modulate this effect as well as examine a possible dose-response effect by studying megacities. Studying brain changes in those living among violence, which is particularly high in places such as Latin America, could help to characterize the interplay between brain predisposition and exposure to violence. Furthermore, exploring the brain in an adverse environment should shed light on the mechanisms underlying resilience. We finally provide examples of two methodological approaches that could contribute to this field, namely a big cohort study in the developing world and a consortium-based meta-analytic approach, and argue about the potential translational value of this research on the development of effective social policies and successful personalized medicine in disadvantaged societies.","D001921; D003906; D004777; D006801; D007843; D059906; D011203; D055500; D012931; D012959; D014505; D014754","Brain; Developing Countries; Environment; Humans; Latin America; Neuroimaging; Poverty; Resilience, Psychological; Social Environment; Socioeconomic Factors; Urban Population; Violence",NA,"NA",NA,"Nicolas A Crossley, Luz Maria Alliende, Tomas Ossandon, Carmen Paz Casta&#xf1;eda, Alfonso Gonz&#xe1;lez-Valderrama, Juan Undurraga, Mariana Castro, Salvador Guinjoan, Ana M D&#xed;az-Zuluaga,  ..., Rodrigo Bressan","Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Clinical Neuroscience, Department of Psychiatry, Federal University of S&#xe3;o Paulo, S&#xe3;o Paulo, Brazil."

This epidemiological analysis identifies risk factors for the incidence of CIPN. This retrospective analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data examined predictors of incident CIPN claims among 11,149 women aged 66 years or older with American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) stage II to IV breast cancer (and no secondary cancer diagnosis or preexisting neuropathy) who received chemotherapy. Overall, new CIPN claims occurred for 8.3% of patients within 1 year of starting chemotherapy. Risk emerged approximately 3 months after the start of chemotherapy and increased throughout 1 year. Paclitaxel as part of first-line therapy increased CIPN risk 2.7-fold in comparison with nonneurotoxic agents (15.9% vs 5.0%), with lower incidence rates for carboplatin and paclitaxel (11.9%), carboplatin and docetaxel (9.3%), carboplatin alone (7.7%), and docetaxel alone (6.6%). The CIPN incidence rate was higher for women who at the time of their breast cancer diagnosis were relatively young (within this Medicare sample), were at AJCC stage II or III, were married or had an equivalent status, and had fewer comorbidities, but it did not differ by race/ethnicity or poverty level. These Medicare claims database findings indicate that women aged 66 years or older with breast cancer are susceptible to CIPN from taxane and/or platinum compounds, with risk emerging approximately 3 months into treatment. Prospective studies of symptom emergence and clinical response (eg, stopping chemotherapy and adjunctive treatments) are indicated to determine how best to inform patients of this risk and to manage CIPN in this population.","D000368; D000369; D000971; D001943; D016190; D015331; D000077143; D005260; D006801; D015994; D006278; D017239; D010523; D012189; D018426; D014481","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Breast Neoplasms; Carboplatin; Cohort Studies; Docetaxel; Female; Humans; Incidence; Medicare; Paclitaxel; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Retrospective Studies; SEER Program; United States","HHSN261201300011C; HHSN261201300011I; P30 CA022453","NA","CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES.

From its beginning, the PSID has provided data useful for addressing intergenerational questions. In the mid-1990s, PSID data supported a series of studies that link early childhood income to early adult attainments, particularly to completed schooling. At the same time, discoveries in neurobiology and epidemiology were beginning to provide details on the processes producing the observed correlations. These discoveries led to a more recent set of PSID-based studies that focus not only on labor market and behavioral outcomes, but also on links between income in the earliest stages of life (including the prenatal period) and adult health.

Exposure to stress and trauma can result in neurocognitive deficits via activation of neurological and other biological mechanisms. PLWH (n = 122) and persons without HIV (n = 95), 35-65 years of age, completed four questionnaires that were used to generate a trauma, economic hardship (food insecurity and low socioeconomic status), and stress composite variable (TES). Participants also completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and standardized self-reports of activities of daily living (ADLs). We examined the independent and interactive effects of TES and HIV status on neurocognitive performance and ADL declines. PLWH had more traumatic events, more food insecurity, lower socioeconomic status, and higher perceived stress compared with HIV- individuals (all ps &lt; .0001). Among PLWH, a higher composite TES score was associated with worse executive functioning (p = .02), worse learning (p = .02), worse working memory (p = .02), and more ADL declines (p &lt; .0001), even after controlling for relevant demographic, psychiatric, substance use, and HIV disease covariates. On their own, individual TES components did not predict these outcomes. Conversely, no significant relationships were observed between TES and cognitive domains nor ADL declines among HIV- individuals. A composite score of trauma, economic hardship, and stress was significantly associated with worse neurocognitive performance and functional declines among PLWH. These adverse experiences may contribute to neurocognitive and daily functioning difficulties commonly observed among PLWH. Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate the relationships between economic/psychosocial adversities and cognitive/functional outcomes over time, and examine potential mediators, such as inflammatory biomarkers.

Weaker handgrip strength is associated with higher odds for depression in LMICs. Future research should seek to establish the predictive value of this inexpensive measure for clinical use.

Knowledge regarding these factors would be beneficial in the development and implementation of effective preventive and management measures for affected patients. The authors conducted a study to gain a better understanding of these factors in a low-income setting. This prospective study was performed at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) in Uganda between January 2014 and June 2017. Patients of any age who presented and were diagnosed with CSDH during the aforementioned time period were included in the study. Variables were collected from patients' files at discharge and follow-up clinic visits. The primary outcome of interest was death. Secondary outcomes of interest included discharge Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, ICU admission, wound infection, and CSDH recurrence. Two hundred five patients, the majority of whom were male (147 [72.8%]), were enrolled in the study. The mean patient age was 60.2 years (SD 17.7). Most CSDHs occurred as a result of motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) and falls, 35.6% (73/205) and 24.9% (51/205), respectively. The sex ratio and mean age varied depending on the mechanism of injury. Headache was the most common presenting symptom (89.6%, 173/193), whereas seizures were uncommon (11.5%, 23/200). Presenting symptoms differed by age. A total of 202 patients underwent surgical intervention with burr holes and drainage, and 22.8% (46) were admitted to the ICU. Two patients suffered a recurrence, 5 developed a postoperative wound infection, and 18 died. Admission GCS score was a significant predictor of the discharge GCS score (p = 0.004), ICU admission (p &lt; 0.001), and death (p &lt; 0.001). Trauma from an MVC is the commonest cause of CSDH among the young. For the elderly, falling is common, but the majority have CSDH with no known cause. Although the clinical presentation is broad, there are several pronounced differences based on age. Burr hole surgery plus drainage is a safe and reliable intervention. A low preoperative GCS score is a risk factor for ICU admission and death.","D000058; D000063; D000367; D000368; D003399; D019049; D004322; D005260; D015600; D006261; D020200; D006801; D008297; D008875; D011203; D011446; D017678; D016896; D014454","Accidental Falls; Accidents, Traffic; Age Factors; Aged; Craniotomy; Developed Countries; Drainage; Female; Glasgow Coma Scale; Headache; Hematoma, Subdural, Chronic; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Poverty; Prospective Studies; Sex Distribution; Treatment Outcome; Uganda",NA,"NA",NA,"David Kitya, Maria Punchak, Jihad Abdelgadir, Oscar Obiga, Derek Harborne, Michael M Haglund","4Duke University Division of Global Neurosurgery and Neuroscience."

The aim of this study is to investigate the potential impact of deprivation and urban/rural areas on capability to live well with dementia and to examine whether availability of informal carers modified the associations. The analysis was based on a large cohort study of 1547 community-dwelling people with dementia across Great Britain. Quality of life, life satisfaction, and well-being were measured as indices of ""living well."" Multivariate modelling was used to investigate differences in living well measures across deprivation quintiles and urban/rural areas adjusting for sociodemographic factors and number of comorbidities and stratifying by three groups: those living with a carer, those with a noncoresident carer and those without a carer. Negative dose-response relationships between deprivation and measures of quality of life (-2.12; 95% CI: -3.52, -0.73), life satisfaction (-1.27; 95% CI: -2.70, 0.16), and well-being (-5.24; 95% CI: -10.11, -0.36) were found in participants living with a carer. The associations were less clear in those with a noncoresident carer and those without a carer but these two groups generally reported lower scores on living well indicators than participants living with a carer. There was no urban/rural difference. The findings suggest inequalities in living well with dementia according to levels of deprivation.

The socioeconomic literature successfully identified the major role of socioeconomic status of parents, both as a direct and indirect effect, in the shaping and intergenerational reproduction of wealth and health. Furthermore, the importance of cognitive abilities as actor in this process has been widely studied in socioeconomic literature. A third factor that has been identified by the socioeconomic discipline is the so-called non-cognitive capabilities. This category, however, lacks a clear definition and seems to be a catchall for a collection of factors. Within the repository of these non-cognitive capabilities the construct of executive functions is an interesting and important contribution from cognitive neuroscience. The multidimensional construct of executive functioning or cognitive control (i.e. planning and formulation of objectives) and monitoring processes (i.e. influences the execution of these goals) is a valuable addition to a framework on reproduction of wealth and health over generations, because executive functions are sensitive to training. Merging insights of the socioeconomic literature and cognitive neuroscience in a life cycle model opens the opportunity of educational initiatives with regard to executive functions to break the intergenerational reproduction of poverty and deprivation.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1037/0033-2909.131.1.30; 10.1037/0894-4105.8.4.485; 10.1016/S0169-7218(11)02414-2; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01019.x; 10.1177/0022219410371676; 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233; 10.1037/0012-1649.22.6.723; 10.1016/S0927-5371(01)00039-2; 10.1177/1359105310390247; 10.1162/JEEA.2009.7.2-3.320; 10.1038/mp.2011.85; 10.1038/41319; 10.1177/0963721412453722; 10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143750; 10.1177/0963721414541462; 10.1037/0012-1649.43.6.1428; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01681.x; 10.1002/acp.934; 10.1073/pnas.0701362104; 10.1257/aer.103.6.2052; 10.1002/acp.1589; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2005.04.005; 10.1080/10409280701610796a; 10.1097/00004583-200502000-00010; 10.1016/j.appdev.2004.04.002; 10.1111/cdev.12096; 10.1073/pnas.0807041106; 10.1126/science.1238041; 10.1126/science.159.3810.56; 10.5993/AJHB.35.1.2; 10.1177/0963721411429458; 10.1006/cogp.1999.0734; 10.1073/pnas.1010076108; 10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2010.11.013; 10.1016/j.jneb.2009.11.003; 10.3102/00346543075003417; 10.1257/089533002760278712; 10.1016/j.intell.2013.11.002",NA,"Elise de Neubourg, Lex Borghans, Karien Coppens, Maria Jansen","2School for Public Health and Primary Care, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands."

However, the specific contributions of cognitive and social aspects of self-regulation, and potential reciprocal relations between them in the prediction of school readiness and early school achievement have not previously been examined. This study examined mediational processes involving children's executive function (EF) skills at 58 months and Grade 1 (G1) and social competence in Kindergarten (K) and G1, as potential pathways by which early-life poverty-related risks influence Grade 2 (G2) math and reading achievement. Data came from the Family Life Project, which is a prospective longitudinal study of 1,292 children and families followed from birth in primarily low-income, non-urban counties in Pennsylvania (PA) and North Carolina (NC). Autoregressive cross-lagged mediation analyses indicated that EF at 58 months through EF at G1 mediated negative associations between cumulative risk exposure and academic skills, with this pathway mediating 36% of the total effect. Furthermore, social competence at K through EF at G1 mediated negative associations between early-life cumulative socioeconomic risk and academic skills, mediating 16% of the total effect. These findings provide evidence that poverty-related risks can influence school readiness and academic achievement via EF. Additionally, these results provide preliminary support for the premise that social competence through EF is a pathway by which cumulative poverty-related risk predicts early academic competence. Our findings are consistent with studies demonstrating developmental associations between EF and social competence.

There are no reliable data on the epidemiology of completed suicide in rural areas of many developing countries, yet suicide is an indicator of the sustainable development goals on health. Using data collected between 2008 and 2016 from the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System in rural Kenya, we retrospectively determined the incidence rate and risk factors for completed suicide. During the period, 104 people died by suicide, contributing to 0.78% (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.74-1.10) of all deaths. The mean annual incidence rate of suicide was 4.61 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.80-5.58) per 100,000 person years of observation (pyo). The annual incidence rate for men was higher than that of women (IRR&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.05, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.98-4.70, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and it increased with age (IRR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.73, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.30-3.24, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). People aged &gt;&#x2009;64&#xa0;years had the highest mean incidence rate of 18.58 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;11.99-28.80) per 100,000 pyo. Completed suicide was associated with age, being male, and living in a house whose wall is made of scrap material, which is a proxy marker of extreme poverty in this region (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.5, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.0-7.0, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). Most cases (76%) completed suicide by hanging themselves. Spatial heterogeneity of rates of suicides was observed across the enumeration zones of the KHDSS. Suicide is common in this area, but the incidence of completed suicide in rural Kenya may be an underestimate of the true burden. Like in other studies, suicide was associated with older age, being male and poverty, but other medical and neuropsychiatric risk factors should be investigated in future studies.","D000328; D017677; D000368; D002423; D005260; D006801; D015994; D007630; D008297; D008875; D012189; D012307; D012424; D017678; D012737; D013405","Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Cause of Death; Female; Humans; Incidence; Kenya; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Sex Distribution; Sex Factors; Suicide","MR/S001255/1","10.1177/014107680509801011; 10.1016/j.rcp.2016.03.006; 10.1521/pedi_2016_30_241; 10.1186/s12889-015-2089-3; 10.1093/oxfordjournals.epirev.a036308; 10.1093/ije/dys062; 10.3402/gha.v6i0.21518; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001711; 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00234-2; 10.1017/S1041610295001931; 10.1111/j.1365-2214.2010.01124.x; 10.1186/s12889-016-2854-y; 10.1186/s12863-017-0538-y; 10.1192/bjp.bp.109.076349; 10.1186/s13033-017-0135-5; 10.1001/archpsyc.1995.03950190076011; 10.1176/appi.ajp.162.11.2116; 10.1192/bjp.171.4.355; 10.1016/S2215-0366(16)30066-9; 10.3402/gha.v7.25593","ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Permission to use data from the KHDSS was granted by the Scientific Ethics and Review Unit of the Kenya Medical Research Institute under protocol number 038/3260.

Different theoretical frameworks exist to explain general evidence-policy interactions. One largely unexplored element of these interrelationships is how evidence interrelates with, and influences, policy/political agenda-setting. This review aims to identify the elements and processes of theories, frameworks and models on interrelationships of research evidence and health policy-making, with a focus on actionability and agenda-setting in the context of mental health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). A systematic review of theories was conducted based on the BeHeMOTh search method, using a tested and refined search strategy. Nine electronic databases and other relevant sources were searched for peer-reviewed and grey literature. Two reviewers screened the abstracts, reviewed full-text articles, extracted data and performed quality assessments. Analysis was based on a thematic analysis. The included papers had to present an actionable theoretical framework/model on evidence and policy interrelationships, such as knowledge translation or evidence-based policy, specifically target the agenda-setting process, focus on mental health, be from LMICs and published in English. From 236 publications included in the full text analysis, no studies fully complied with our inclusion criteria. Widening the focus by leaving out 'agenda-setting', we included ten studies, four of which had unique conceptual frameworks focusing on mental health and LMICs but not agenda-setting. The four analysed frameworks confirmed research gaps from LMICs and mental health, and a lack of focus on agenda-setting. Frameworks and models from other health and policy areas provide interesting conceptual approaches and lessons with regards to agenda-setting. Our systematic review identified frameworks on evidence and policy interrelations that differ in their elements and processes. No framework fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Four actionable frameworks are applicable to mental health and LMICs, but none specifically target agenda-setting. We have identified agenda-setting as a research theory gap in the context of mental health knowledge translation in LMICs. Frameworks from other health/policy areas could offer lessons on agenda-setting and new approaches for creating policy impact for mental health and to tackle the translational gap in LMICs.","D003695; D003906; D019317; D006291; D006801; D007182; D001523; D008603; D008605; D011050; D011203; D057170","Delivery of Health Care; Developing Countries; Evidence-Based Medicine; Health Policy; Humans; Income; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Policy Making; Poverty; Translational Research, Biomedical","MR/S001255/1; R01 MH100470; ES/J500057/1","10.1186/1748-5908-7-50; 10.1002/wps.20133; 10.1177/070674370805300501; 10.1002/chp.55; 10.1007/s11920-017-0780-z; 10.1186/1478-4505-12-2; 10.1332/174426416X14609261565901; 10.1186/1472-6963-14-2; 10.1258/jrsm.2011.110180; 10.1186/1478-4505-13-1; 10.1186/s12961-017-0247-z; 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2006.03775.x; 10.1002/chp.47; 10.1111/j.1741-6787.2004.t01-1-04009.x; 10.1111/j.1468-0009.2007.00506.x; 10.1186/s12961-018-0284-2; 10.1186/1478-4505-12-34; 10.15171/ijhpm.2015.10; 10.1258/jrsm.2011.110285; 10.1111/j.1468-0009.2011.00643.x; 10.2307/3109916; 10.1186/1478-4505-11-30; 10.1332/147084414X13988707323088; 10.1371/journal.pone.0077404; 10.1186/s12961-015-0013-z; 10.1111/1468-0009.12026; 10.1332/174426514X672380; 10.1186/1478-4505-6-12; 10.1002/jid.1235; 10.1186/s12961-015-0016-9; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.04.020; 10.1093/heapol/czn019; 10.1177/0141076814530600; 10.1186/1478-4505-7-26; 10.1093/bmb/ldm010; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61241-0; 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61817-6; 10.1017/S2045796015000359; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61263-X; 10.3109/10673229.2012.649117; 10.1192/bjp.bp.108.050187; 10.1016/j.aogh.2014.04.014; 10.1017/gmh.2016.20; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00727.x; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.01.033; 10.1258/135581902320432778; 10.1176/appi.ps.201400329; 10.1332/174426413X662671; 10.1332/174426409X463811; 10.1186/s13012-015-0351-9; 10.1093/heapol/9.4.353; 10.1186/1478-4505-1-2; 10.1186/1478-4505-12-55; 10.1186/s12961-017-0192-x; 10.1186/1472-6963-12-200; 10.1017/S2045796017000452; 10.3109/09638237.2014.976857; 10.1111/1468-0009.00005; 10.1093/heapol/czu081; 10.2196/publichealth.5014; 10.1111/j.1541-0072.2009.00345.x; 10.1186/1472-6963-9-43; 10.1016/0168-8510(95)00728-B; 10.1093/heapol/czq078; 10.2471/BLT.06.030593; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005431; 10.1111/hir.12108; 10.1016/j.ijsu.2010.02.007; 10.1186/1471-2288-11-29; 10.1186/s13012-015-0242-0; 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2004.09.002; 10.1136/bmj.b2700; 10.1186/1472-6947-7-16; 10.1177/1049732312452938; 10.1186/1471-2288-6-35; 10.1080/09614520500450925; 10.2471/BLT.05.027789; 10.2471/BLT.06.030312; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.05.009; 10.1186/s12961-015-0018-7; 10.1111/1468-0009.t01-1-00052; 10.1186/s12961-015-0029-4; 10.1186/1471-2458-7-309; 10.1186/s12992-016-0209-1; 10.1186/1748-5908-8-44; 10.1186/s12961-017-0264-y; 10.1016/j.ijid.2015.10.024; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61579-7; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.06.016; 10.7870/cjcmh-2017-022; 10.1258/135581903322405126; 10.1111/j.1475-6773.2009.00958.x; 10.1186/s13012-016-0496-1; 10.1186/1478-4505-7-30; 10.1016/j.puhe.2014.02.004; 10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00583.x; 10.1186/s13012-017-0642-4; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.01.034; 10.1046/j.1365-3156.1999.00497.x; 10.1016/j.healthpol.2006.03.006; 10.1080/14623730.2017.1326398; 10.1080/j.1440-1665.2005.02187.x; 10.1038/nature16032; 10.1590/S0102-311X2004000200023","ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Ethics approval for the wider study has been obtained from King&#x2019;s College London under KCL Ethics Ref: LRS-15/16&#x2013;2618.

This review identifies factors associated with formal health service utilisation for CMD in the general adult population, and compares evidence from high-income countries (HIC) with that from low-and-middle-income countries (LMIC). We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE and Scopus in May 2016. Eligibility criteria were: published in English, in peer-reviewed journals; using population-based samples; employing standardised CMD measures; measuring use of formal health services for mental health reasons by people with CMD; testing the association between this outcome and any other factor(s). Risk of bias was assessed using the adapted Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. We synthesised the results using ""best fit framework synthesis"", with reference to the Andersen socio-behavioural model. Fifty two studies met inclusion criteria. 46 (88%) were from HIC. Predisposing factors: There was evidence linking increased likelihood of service use with female gender; Caucasian ethnicity; higher education levels; and being unmarried; although this was not consistent across all studies. Need factors: There was consistent evidence of an association between service utilisation and self-evaluated health status; duration of symptoms; disability; comorbidity; and panic symptoms. Associations with symptom severity were frequently but less consistently reported. Enabling factors: The evidence did not support an association with income or rural residence. Inconsistent evidence was found for associations between unemployment or having health insurance and use of services. There was a lack of research from LMIC and on contextual level factors. In HIC, failure to seek treatment for CMD is associated with less disabling symptoms and lack of perceived need for healthcare, consistent with suggestions that ""treatment gap"" statistics over-estimate unmet need for care as perceived by the target population. Economic factors and urban/rural residence appear to have little effect on treatment-seeking rates. Strategies to address potential healthcare inequities for men, ethnic minorities, the young and the elderly in HIC require further evaluation.

Formative work was undertaken previously to design a culturally appropriate CBR intervention for people with schizophrenia in Ethiopia. The current study explored the acceptability and feasibility of CBR in practice, as well as how CBR may improve functioning among people with schizophrenia. This mixed methods pilot study took place in rural Ethiopia between December 2014 and December 2015. Ten people with schizophrenia who were unresponsive to treatment with medication alone, and their caregivers, participated in CBR. CBR was led by lay workers with five weeks training and involved home visits (education, family intervention and support returning to work) and community mobilisation. Theory of change was used to guide the pilot evaluation. Qualitative and quantitative data&#xa0;were collected at baseline, six months and 12&#xa0;months. Forty in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions were conducted with 31 individuals comprising people with schizophrenia, caregivers, CBR workers, supervisors, health officers and community members. The RISE CBR intervention may have a positive impact on functioning through the pathways of enhanced family support, improved access to health care, increased income and improved self-esteem. CBR was acceptable to CBR workers, community leaders and health officers. Some CBR workers found it challenging to accept the choices of people with schizophrenia. These concerns were felt to be resolvable with supplementary training for CBR workers. The intervention was feasible but&#xa0;further evaluation is needed on a larger scale. In low and middle-income countries, CBR may be an acceptable and feasible adjuvant approach to facility-based care for people with schizophrenia. However, contextual factors, including poverty and inaccessible anti-psychotic medication, remain substantial challenges. There were indications that CBR can impact on functioning but the RISE trial will determine effectiveness.","D000328; D017028; D003156; D005002; D005260; D017144; D006801; D007182; D008297; D008875; D010865; D011203; D012424; D012559; D012565; D011795; D013997","Adult; Caregivers; Community Mental Health Services; Ethiopia; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Income; Male; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Poverty; Rural Population; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors","MR/K012126/1; MR/M025470/1; 100142/Z/12/Z","10.1016/j.schres.2005.05.028; 10.1192/bjp.bp.105.020982; 10.1016/j.schres.2013.10.032; 10.1186/s12992-017-0273-1; 10.1192/bjp.bp.114.149112; 10.1186/s12888-015-0418-9; 10.1016/j.schres.2014.10.053; 10.1080/19439342.2016.1157623; 10.1186/s12888-017-1516-7; 10.1186/s12888-015-0400-6; 10.1371/journal.pone.0143572; 10.1186/s13063-016-1427-9; 10.1186/1745-6215-15-267; 10.1371/journal.pone.0126666; 10.1016/j.schres.2004.05.017; 10.1186/s12955-017-0647-3; 10.1016/S0920-9964(99)00088-2; 10.1001/archpsyc.1987.01800180050009; 10.1192/bjp.191.50.s7; 10.1186/s13012-016-0422-6; 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; 10.1093/heapol/czv072; 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61817-6; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1993.tb02093.x; 10.1016/j.jad.2015.07.015; 10.1177/1609406917733847; 10.1353/nas.2004.0018; 10.1186/2193-1801-3-189; 10.1186/1471-244X-13-168; 10.1186/s12939-017-0657-0","Ethical approval was obtained from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) Research Ethics Committee and the Addis Ababa University College of Health Sciences Institutional Review Board.

Cross-sectional surveys were disseminated via professional and family networks in 32 European countries for 3 months from December 2016. Families (n=731), of whom 45% met UNICEF criteria for severe poverty, and professionals (n=959) responded from 23 and 32 countries respectively. Respondents were grouped into those from countries with and without austerity. The direct and indirect impact of austerity cuts and worse working conditions were reported more often by professionals from countries with austerity, compared to those without. Most families reported services to be worse in quality than 3 years ago. Families with completely dependent disabled children said the needs of their disabled children are significantly less well met now, compared to 10 years ago. A decline in quality of services for disabled children was reported by most family and many professional respondents across Europe, regardless of austerity. Where implemented, austerity measures were reported to have impacted significantly on families with disabled children. What this paper adds Stigma about disability remains a challenge in many countries across Europe.

A total of 324 participants were recruited from an existing community-ascertained cohort of people with SMD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;218), and attendees at the Butajira General Hospital psychiatric clinic (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;106). Inclusion criteria defined people with SMD who had ongoing need for care: those who were on psychotropic medication, currently symptomatic or had a relapse in the preceding 2&#xa0;years. The World Health Organization Disability Assessment schedule (WHODAS-2.0) and the Butajira Functioning Scale (BFS) were used to assess functional impairment. Multivariable negative binomial regression models were fitted to investigate the association between demographic, socio-economic and clinical characteristics, and functional impairment. Increasing age, being unmarried, rural residence, poorer socio-economic status, symptom severity, continuous course of illness, medication side effects, and internalized stigma were associated with functional impairment across self-reported and caregiver responses for both the WHODAS and the BFS. Diagnosis per se was not associated consistently with functional impairment. To optimize functioning in people with chronic SMD in this setting, services need to target residual symptoms, poverty, medication side effects, and internalized stigma. Testing the impact of community interventions to promote recovery will be useful. Advocacy for more tolerable treatment options is warranted.","D000328; D002908; D017281; D003430; D004185; D005002; D005260; D006801; D008297; D001523; D008875; D015999; D012044; D012424; D057566","Adult; Chronic Disease; Cost of Illness; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disability Evaluation; Ethiopia; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Regression Analysis; Rural Population; Self Report","MR/M025470/1; U19MH095699; DEL-15-01","NA",NA,"Kassahun Habtamu, Atalay Alem, Girmay Medhin, Abebaw Fekadu, Charlotte Hanlon","Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia."

The present article addresses the question of whether and how neuroscience can contribute to the development of social policy concerning poverty and the social and ethical risks inherent in trying. I argue that the neuroscience approach to SES-related policy has been both prematurely celebrated and peremptorily dismissed and that some of its possible social impacts have been viewed with excessive alarm. Neuroscience has already made modest contributions to SES-related policy, and its potential to have a more effective and beneficial influence can be expected to grow over the coming years.","D000818; D001921; D006801; D000075762; D009474; D009488; D011640; D012923","Animals; Brain; Humans; Interdisciplinary Research; Neurons; Neurosciences; Public Policy; Social Class",NA,"NA",NA,"Martha J Farah","Center for Neuroscience &amp; Society, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."

This included Aksum School of Medicine situated in Aksum, a rural town in Northern Ethiopia. The new Innovative Medical Curriculum (NIMC) is a four-year programme designed by the Ethiopian Federal Ministries of Health and Education. The curriculum is designed to train biomedical science graduates to become doctors in 4&#xa0;years, with a focus on the healthcare needs of rural people living in poverty. This research was conducted at Aksum School of Medicine and included two hospitals (Aksum Referral Hospital and St Mary's District Hospital). This study focused on medical students during their clinical years across multiple specialities (61 Clerkship 1 students and 13 Clerkship 2 students). We used primarily qualitative research methods supplemented with quantitative measures. There were 3 stages of data collection over a 1&#xa0;month period, this included qualitative group interviews, direct observation of students in a clinical setting and direct observation of skills sessions followed by a questionnaire on the sessions. We analysed the data by reconstructing the student experience and comparing it with the NIMC. The proposed typical week set out in the NIMC tended to differ from the real clinical experience of these students. Through qualitative group interview and direct observation of teaching, the main theme that was consistent throughout was the lack of doctors with specialist postgraduate training. Clinical need often took priority over education. However, students enjoyed taking early responsibility and gaining practical experience. Through direct observation of skills sessions and short questionnaires, these sessions were highly valuable to the students and they felt confident in carrying out the taught procedures in the future. The combination of poorly resourced hospitals and lack of specialist doctors provides a challenging environment for medical students to learn. However, it is a unique clinical experience that is rarely seen in developed countries and facilitates the acquirement of skills from an early stage. Supervision and specialist input is fundamental in enabling students to learn and this is a key area that was lacking in the students' clinical experience.","D003479; D003880; D004501; D005002; D013502; D006176; D006780; D006801; D009774; D009885; D010820; D011204; D036301; D012423; D012577; D013337; D013997","Curriculum; Dermatology; Education, Medical; Ethiopia; General Surgery; Gynecology; Hospitals, Rural; Humans; Obstetrics; Ophthalmology; Physicians; Poverty Areas; Qualitative Research; Rural Health; Schools, Medical; Students, Medical; Time Factors",NA,"10.1046/j.1365-2923.2002.01327.x; 10.1111/j.1365-2923.1989.tb00885.x; 10.1097/00001888-199604000-00018; 10.1097/00001888-200403000-00017; 10.1046/j.1365-2923.2000.00513.x; 10.1046/j.1365-2923.2000.00758.x; 10.2147/AMEP.S97916; 10.1186/s12960-015-0048-9; 10.1001/jama.1983.03340060055026; 10.3109/01421599309006654; 10.1097/ACM.0000000000002003","AUTHORS&#x2019; INFORMATION: CM graduated from the University of St Andrews with a BSc [1st class] in Medicine, and completed her MBBS degree at Barts and the London School of Medicine.

Our first argument is that VR can be useful by virtue of its differences from the normal perceptual environment. That is, by virtue of its relative non-realism and poverty of its perceptual elements, it can actually offer increased clarity with respect to the features of interest for the researcher. Our second argument is that VR exerts its measurable influence more by eliciting an acceptance of the virtual world (i.e., 'suspension of disbelief') rather than by eliciting a true belief of the realism of the VR environment.

Both men and women who were bullied in childhood were less likely to be in employment and had accumulated less wealth in the form of home-ownership or savings than participants who were not bullied. Individual earnings from paid employment were lower for women who were bullied in childhood. Frequent bullying in childhood was also associated with higher societal employment-related costs for men and higher health service costs for women.

After six months, 31 GPs (62%) [19 men (61.3%); mean age: 33&#xb1;5.0years] participated in the second module. Before the training, the majority of GPs declared a low level of satisfaction about their epilepsy knowledge, which improved after the courses. A change in practices was recorded after the training, with an increased confidence to manage antiepileptic treatment. Our study showed the significant impact of specific training programs on epilepsy among GPs.","D000328; D001291; D001838; D004827; D005260; D058005; D007722; D006801; D008297; D011203; D011320; D012424; D011795","Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Bolivia; Epilepsy; Female; General Practitioners; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Poverty; Primary Health Care; Rural Population; Surveys and Questionnaires",NA,"NA",NA,"Loretta Giuliano, Calogero Edoardo Cicero, Sandra Padilla, Mario Camargo, Vito Sofia, Mario Zappia, Alessandro Bartoloni, Elizabeth Blanca Crespo G&#xf3;mez, Alessandra Nicoletti","Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences and Advanced Technologies ""G.F.

We aimed to study the effect of care dependence among older adult residents on the economic functioning of their households, in catchment area survey sites in Peru, Mexico and China. Households were classified from the evolution of the needs for care of older residents, over two previous community surveys, as 'incident care', 'chronic care' or 'no care', and followed up three years later to ascertain economic outcomes (household income, consumption, economic strain, satisfaction with economic circumstances, healthcare expenditure and residents giving up work or education to care). Household income did not differ between household groups. However, income from paid work (Pooled Count Ratio pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78-1.00) and government transfers (pCR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.93) were lower in care households. Consumption was 12% lower in chronic care households (pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77-0.99). Household healthcare expenditure was higher (pCR 1.55, 95% CI 1.26-1.90), and catastrophic healthcare spending more common (pRR 1.64, 95% CI 1.64-2.22) in care households. While endogeneity cannot be confidently excluded as an explanation for the findings, this study indicates that older people's needs for care have a discernable impact on household economics, controlling for baseline indicators of long-term economic status. Although living, typically, in multigenerational family units, older people have not featured prominently in global health and development agendas. Population ageing will rapidly increase the number of households where older people live, and their societal significance. Building sustainable long-term care systems for the future will require some combination of improved income security in old age; incentivisation of informal care through compensation for direct and opportunity costs; and development of community care services to support, and, where necessary, supplement or substitute the central role of informal caregivers.","D000368; D002681; D015331; D003695; D006798; D006801; D008800; D010568; D012959","Aged; China; Cohort Studies; Delivery of Health Care; Housing; Humans; Mexico; Peru; Socioeconomic Factors",NA,"10.2105/AJPH.2012.301115; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.10.031; 10.1186/1471-2458-8-285; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.08.032; 10.1177/0898264315584577; 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2006.00944.x; 10.1371/journal.pone.0144722; 10.1136/jech-2013-203698; 10.1093/gerona/glt105; 10.1080/01634372.2015.1019657; 10.1136/bmjopen-2013-002683; 10.1007/s10198-011-0357-4; 10.1080/17441692.2014.971332; 10.1186/1471-2318-10-53; 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61829-8; 10.1002/gps.1046; 10.1002/gps.2727; 10.1186/2193-1801-3-379; 10.1371/journal.pone.0182360; 10.1186/1471-2458-7-165; 10.1002/sim.1186; 10.1017/S1041610214000039; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61147-7; 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61884-3; 10.1080/09540260802094712","<b>Competing Interests: </b>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Ma&#xeb;lenn M Guerchet, Mariella Guerra, Yueqin Huang, Peter Lloyd-Sherlock, Ana Luisa Sosa, Richard Uwakwe, Isaac Acosta, Peter Ezeah, Sara Gallardo,  ..., Martin J Prince","King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Health Service and Population Research Department, London, United Kingdom."

It disproportionally affects men and has disabling physical, psychological, and behavioral consequences. These can lead to a cascade of negative effects on men's families, with documented ties to intimate partner violence (IPV) and child maltreatment. These multi-level problems are often exacerbated where poverty rates are high, including low and middle-income countries (LMICs). In contexts where strong patriarchal norms place men in positions of power, family-level consequences are often even more pronounced. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on interventions in LMICs targeting men's problem drinking and any family-related outcomes. Cochrane and PRISMA procedures guided the review. The search was conducted in PsychInfo, PubMed, and Web of Science. The search yielded 1357 publications. Nine studies from four different countries met inclusion criteria. Of those, only one had the primary goal of simultaneously improving drinking and a related family-level outcome (IPV). Six of the studies documented modest improvements on both drinking and couples or family outcomes. Strategies common to these included cognitive-behavioral techniques, communication skills training, narrative therapy, and participatory learning. Gender-transformative approaches were associated with reduced IPV and more equitable gender norms, and motivational interviewing and behavioral approaches were beneficial for reducing alcohol use.

However, little is known about the correlates of SB in people with depression. Thus, we investigated SB correlates among community-dwelling adults with depression in six low- and middle-income countries. Cross-sectional data from the World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health were analyzed. The analysis was restricted to those with DSM-IV Depression or receiving depression treatment in the last 12 months. Self-reported time spent sedentary per day was the outcome. High SB was defined as &#x2265;8 hours of SB per day. The correlates (sociodemographic and health-related) of SB were estimated by multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses. In 2375 individuals with depression (mean age=48.0 years; 60.7% female), the prevalence of high SB was 11.1% (95%CI=8.2%-14.9%), while the mean (&#xb1;SD) time spent sedentary was 215 (&#xb1;192) minutes per day. Socio-demographic factors significantly associated with high SB were older age and being unmarried, being male and being unemployed. In other domains, no alcohol consumption, current smoking, mild cognitive impairment, bodily pain, arthritis, stroke, disability, and lower levels of social cohesion, COPD, visual impairment, and poor self-rated health was associated with greater time spent sedentary. Our data suggest that future interventions seeking to reduce SB among individuals with depression may target at risk groups based on identified sociodemographic correlates while the promotion of social cohesion may have the potential to increase the efficacy of future public health initiatives. From a clinical perspective, bodily pain and somatic co-morbidities need to be taken into account.","D000293; D000328; D000368; D002681; D003430; D003866; D003906; D005260; D005869; D006801; D007194; D008297; D008800; D008875; D011203; D015995; D012426; D057185; D013019; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depressive Disorder; Developing Countries; Female; Ghana; Humans; India; Male; Mexico; Middle Aged; Poverty; Prevalence; Russia; Sedentary Behavior; South Africa; Young Adult","ICA-CL-2017-03-001","NA",NA,"Davy Vancampfort, Brendon Stubbs, James Mugisha, Joseph Firth, Felipe B Schuch, Ai Koyanagi","Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Centro de Investigaci&#xf3;n Biom&#xe9;dica en Red de Salud Mental, CIBERSAM, Monforte de Lemos 3-5 Pabell&#xf3;n 11, Madrid 28029, Spain; Research and Development Unit, Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de D&#xe9;u, Universitat de Barcelona, Fundaci&#xf3; Sant Joan de D&#xe9;u, Dr. Antoni Pujadas, 42, Sant Boi de Llobregat, Barcelona 0883, Spain."

Using a case-based approach, we examine appropriate access of children of minor parents in an international vaccine trial. We first consider the scientific justification for inclusion of children of minor parents in a vaccine trial. Laws and regulations governing consent generally do not address the issue of minor parents. In their absence, local community and cultural contexts may influence consent processes. Rights of the minor parent include dignity in their role as a parent and respect for their decision-making capacity in that role. Rights of the child include the right to have decisions made in their best interest and the right to the highest attainable standard of health. Children of minor parents may have vulnerabilities related to the age of their parent, such as increased rates of poverty, that have implications for consent. Neuroscience research suggests that, by age 12-14&#xa0;years, minors have adult-level capacity to make research decisions in situations with low emotion and low distraction.

Few studies have looked at factors associated with both food insecurity and maternal depression as outcomes. This study aimed to assess factors associated with food insecurity and depression in a sample of pregnant South African women. We conducted a cross-sectional study at a Midwife Obstetric Unit in a low-income suburb in Cape Town. Pregnant women attending the clinic for their first antenatal visit were invited to participate. The shortened form of the US Household Food Security Survey Module was used to measure food insecurity. The Expanded Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview was used to diagnose depression, anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and assess for suicidal ideation and behaviour. Logistic regression modelling was conducted to explore factors associated with food insecurity and depression in separate models. We found that 42% of households were food insecure and that 21% of participants were depressed (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;376). The odds of being food insecure were increased in women with suicidal behaviour (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.34; 95% CI 1.26-22.57), with depression (4.27; 1.43-12.70) and in those with three or more children (3.79; 1.25-11.55). The odds of depression was greater in women who were food insecure (5.30; 1.63-17.30), substance dependent (15.83; 1.31-191.48) or diagnosed with an anxiety disorder (5.04; 1.71-14.82). Food insecurity and depression are strongly associated in pregnant women. The relationship between food insecurity and depression is complex and requires further investigation. Interventions that improve both food security and mental health during the perinatal period are likely to benefit the physical and mental well-being of mothers and children.","D000328; D001007; D003430; D003863; D005260; D005523; D006801; D016015; D011203; D011247; D011248; D037841; D011569; D013019","Adult; Anxiety; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Food Supply; Humans; Logistic Models; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnant Women; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; South Africa",NA,"10.2105/AJPH.89.8.1231; 10.1016/j.jad.2006.09.029; 10.1136/jech.2007.066191; 10.2471/BLT.11.091850; 10.1001/jama.295.12.1376; 10.1016/j.jad.2011.08.011; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02198.x; 10.1007/s00127-016-1249-9; 10.1186/1471-2458-13-215; 10.1186/s12884-015-0699-5; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.12.042; 10.1542/peds.2009-0583; 10.1186/1471-2393-13-135; 10.1111/j.1740-8709.2010.00266.x; 10.1017/S1368980008003650; 10.1207/s15327752jpa5201_2; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1990.tb01360.x; 10.1177/019251396017003001; 10.1016/S0924-9338(97)83296-8; 10.1016/j.jad.2013.04.040; 10.1089/apc.2007.0102; 10.1016/S0924-9338(98)80004-7; 10.1186/s12888-016-1178-x; 10.1016/j.jad.2016.05.052; 10.1016/j.worlddev.2007.10.008; 10.1111/roiw.12016; 10.1080/10796126.2014.891973; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.04.027; 10.3390/nu8120819; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.06.022; 10.1136/jech.2007.069351; 10.1186/1471-244X-12-63; 10.1007/s00127-015-1018-1; 10.1080/03670240903001167; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60754-X; 10.1016/S0277-9536(01)00013-2; 10.1093/jn/129.2.525S; 10.1093/jn/131.10.2670; 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00358; 10.1097/01.nmd.0000120886.39886.a3; 10.1126/science.1232491; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.05.031","CONFLICT OF INTEREST: On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author states that there is no conflict of interest.

Individuals aged 50 and older (N=32,715; mean age 62.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;15.6; 51.7% female). The definition of MCI was based on the recommendations of the National Institute on Ageing and Alzheimer's Association. Ten chronic conditions were assessed (angina pectoris, arthritis, asthma, cataract, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, edentulism, hearing problems, hypertension, stroke). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between chronic physical conditions, multimorbidity (&#x2265;2 chronic conditions), and MCI. The prevalence of multimorbidity was 49.8% (95% confidence interval (CI)=48.1-51.5%) and of MCI was 15.3% (95% CI=14.4-16.3%). After adjustment for potential confounders, edentulism (odds ratio (OR)=1.24), arthritis (OR=1.24), chronic lung disease (OR=1.29), cataract (OR=1.33), stroke (OR=1.94), hearing problems (OR=2.27), and multimorbidity (OR=1.40) were significantly associated with MCI.

The aim of this study was to identify the coping strategies used by women with PPD symptoms in rural Ethiopia to inform the development of socio-culturally appropriate interventions. A population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in a predominantly rural district in southern Ethiopia. All women with live infants between one and 12&#xa0;months post-partum (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3147) were screened for depression symptoms using the validated Patient Health Questionnaire, 9 item version (PHQ-9). Those scoring five or more, 'high PPD symptoms', (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;385) were included in this study. The Brief Coping with Problems Experienced (COPE-28) scale was used to assess coping strategies. Construct validity of the brief COPE was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis of the brief COPE scale supported the previously hypothesized three dimensions of coping (problem-focused, emotion-focused, and dysfunctional). Emotion-focused coping was the most commonly employed coping strategy by women with PPD symptoms. Urban residence was associated positively with all three dimensions of coping. Women who had attended formal education and who attributed their symptoms to a physical cause were more likely to use both problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies. Women with better subjective wealth and those who perceived that their husband drank too much alcohol were more likely to use emotion-focused coping. Dysfunctional coping strategies were reported by women who had a poor relationship with their husbands. As in high-income countries, women with PPD symptoms were most likely to use emotion-focused and dysfunctional coping strategies. Poverty and the low level of awareness of depression as an illness may additionally impede problem-solving attempts to cope. Prospective studies are needed to understand the prognostic significance of coping styles in this setting and to inform psychosocial intervention development.","D000223; D000328; D003430; D019052; D004644; D005002; D005163; D005260; D006801; D010465; D011247; D011340; D012424","Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression, Postpartum; Emotions; Ethiopia; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Perception; Pregnancy; Problem Solving; Rural Population","MR/M025470/1; 201446","10.4103/2141-9248.139268; 10.2471/BLT.11.091850; 10.1093/bmb/ldr047; 10.2471/BLT.11.088187; 10.1186/1471-244X-10-32; 10.1111/j.1740-8709.2007.00088.x; 10.1111/j.1365-2214.2006.00598.x; 10.1136/adc.2010.183327; 10.1001/archpsyc.61.9.946; 10.1136/adc.2009.165571; 10.1136/adc.88.1.34; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01752.x; 10.1080/03014460802043624; 10.1177/070674370705200803; 10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2013.08.013; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001541; 10.2471/BLT.12.109819; 10.1037/0022-3514.46.4.839; 10.1037/0022-3514.56.2.267; 10.1037/0022-3514.57.6.1024; 10.1159/000346633; 10.12659/MSM.889778; 10.1037/0022-3514.46.4.877; 10.1300/J010v35n01_08; 10.1016/S0015-0282(98)00089-2; 10.1007/s00737-013-0338-y; 10.1007/s00737-003-0038-0; 10.1007/s00127-007-0166-3; 10.1207/s15327558ijbm0401_6; 10.1097/NMD.0b013e31818b504c; 10.1097/HTR.0b013e3181fc5e1e; 10.1080/00223891.2014.886255; 10.1007/s10461-014-0872-2; 10.1177/1359105309346516; 10.3390/rel2030216; 10.1046/j.1525-1497.2001.016009606.x; 10.1016/j.jad.2006.05.021; 10.1002/gps.2442; 10.1111/j.1744-6163.2009.00224.x; 10.1370/afm.933; 10.1016/j.jad.2014.02.012; 10.1016/j.jad.2008.05.009; 10.1016/j.jad.2015.07.015; 10.1017/S0033291798007065; 10.1016/j.jad.2011.11.028; 10.1007/s00127-006-0051-5; 10.1186/1471-244X-14-194; 10.1037/0033-2909.129.2.216; 10.5402/2012/128672; 10.1176/appi.psy.43.6.456; 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(200004)56:4&lt;519::AID-JCLP6&gt;3.0.CO;2-1; 10.1089/jpm.2008.0250; 10.1176/ajp.149.12.1693; 10.1363/3900613; 10.1186/s12939-017-0657-0; 10.1016/S0277-9536(03)00062-5; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.07.043; 10.1016/j.hrtlng.2013.07.009; 10.1111/tmi.12658","ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University.

We investigated correlates of sedentary behaviour among community-dwelling adults aged &#x2265;18 years with hazardous drinking patterns in six low- and middle-income countries. Cross-sectional data were analyzed from the World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health. Hazardous drinking was defined as consuming &gt;7 (females) or &gt;14 (males) standard drinks per week. Associations between time spent sedentary and a range of correlates were examined using multivariable linear and logistic regression.

This paper addresses the question of whether income inequality is associated with the population prevalence of depression and, if so, the potential mechanisms and pathways which may explain this association. Our systematic review included 26 studies, mostly from high-income countries. Nearly two-thirds of all studies and five out of six longitudinal studies reported a statistically significant positive relationship between income inequality and risk of depression; only one study reported a statistically significant negative relationship. Twelve studies were included in a meta-analysis with dichotomized inequality groupings. The pooled risk ratio was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.07-1.31), demonstrating greater risk of depression in populations with higher income inequality relative to populations with lower inequality. Multiple studies reported subgroup effects, including greater impacts of income inequality among women and low-income populations. We propose an ecological framework, with mechanisms operating at the national level (the neo-material hypothesis), neighbourhood level (the social capital and the social comparison hypotheses) and individual level (psychological stress and social defeat hypotheses) to explain this association. We conclude that policy makers should actively promote actions to reduce income inequality, such as progressive taxation policies and a basic universal income. Mental health professionals should champion such policies, as well as promote the delivery of interventions which target the pathways and proximal determinants, such as building life skills in adolescents and provision of psychological therapies and packages of care with demonstrated effectiveness for settings of poverty and high income inequality.",NA,NA,"K01 MH104310; R21 MH111280; U19 MH113211","NA",NA,"Vikram Patel, Jonathan K Burns, Monisha Dhingra, Leslie Tarver, Brandon A Kohrt, Crick Lund","Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."

We also examine how low maternal education and single parenthood interact with these poverty exposures to compound their adverse effects. Finally, we compare the magnitude of effects associated with the patterns of poverty exposure, as well as their interactions with low maternal education and single parenthood, on trajectories of externalizing and internalizing behaviors to determine if they are significantly different. Results reveal that initial levels and rates of change in children's trajectories of externalizing and internalizing behaviors are similar across the three changing patterns of poverty exposure, leading us to combine them into a single group representing intermittent poverty. Initial disparities between children who are never poor and their counterparts who are always or intermittently poor are constant over time for internalizing behaviors and grow in magnitude for externalizing behaviors. The cumulative negative effect of poverty exposure over time is stronger for externalizing vs. internalizing behaviors.

Little is known regarding the relative importance of social causation and social drift in low and middle-income countries, where poverty is more severe and where most of the world's depressed individuals live. We analysed nationally representative longitudinal data from the National Income Dynamics Study in South Africa and simultaneously tested social causation and social drift hypotheses using structural equation modelling across three waves. Worse individual economic status at time 1 and 2 was independently associated with worse depression two years later at time 2 (standardised linear regression coefficient &#x3b2; = -0.110, Standard Error (SE): 0.024) and four years later at time 3 (&#x3b2; = -0.113, SE: 0.025) respectively.

In addition, the ""effect"" of depression on future assets was stronger among people with less baseline assets. The time span between data rounds is relatively short (four years); response rates are unequal across ethnic, age and sex groups; and the measure of depression is based on self-report. Social causation and social drift act simultaneously in this population, reinforcing poverty/depression cycles.

Diurnal cortisol, income, cumulative risk, and parenting were measured at 4 time points, once every 9months, starting when children were 36-40months.

This article provides evidence and insights on barriers which, if overcome, would enable the harmonization of strategies to tackle the dementia challenge in LAC. First, we analyze the lack of available epidemiologic data, the need for standardizing clinical practice and improving physician training, and the existing barriers regarding resources, culture, and stigmas. We discuss how these are preventing timely care and research. Regarding specific health actions, most LAC have minimal mental health facilities and do not have specific mental health policies or budgets specific to dementia. In addition, local regulations may need to consider the regional context when developing treatment and prevention strategies. The support needed nationally and internationally to enable a smooth and timely transition of LAC to a position that integrates global strategies is highlighted. We focus on shared issues of poverty, cultural barriers, and socioeconomic vulnerability. We identify avenues for collaboration aimed to study unique populations, improve valid assessment methods, and generate opportunities for translational research, thus establishing a regional network.

An important, yet poorly explained epidemiological feature of NCDs is their low incidence in under developed areas of low-income countries and rising rates in urban areas. With the goal of better understanding how urbanization increases the incidence of NCDs, we provide an overview of the urbanization process in sub-Saharan Africa, discuss gene expression differences between rural and urban populations, and review the current NCD determinant model. We conclude by identifying research priorities. Declining rates of chronic and recurrent infection are the hallmark of urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa. Gene profiling studies show urbanization results in complex molecular changes, with almost one-third of the peripheral blood leukocyte transcriptome altered. The current NCD determinant model could be improved by including a possible effect from declining rates of infection and expanding the spectrum of diseases that increase with urbanization. Urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa provides a unique opportunity to investigate the mechanism by which the environment influences disease epidemiology. Research priorities include: (1) studies to define the relationship between infection and risk factors for NCDs, (2) explaining the observed differences in the inflammatory response between rural and urban populations, and (3) identification of animal models that simulate the biological changes that occurs with urbanization. A better understanding of the biological changes that occur with urbanization could lead to new prevention and treatment strategies for some of the most common surgical diseases in high-income countries.","D017954; D002648; D002908; D003906; D015870; D006801; D015994; D007239; D000073296; D011203; D012008; D012307; D012424; D014505; D014507","Africa South of the Sahara; Child; Chronic Disease; Developing Countries; Gene Expression; Humans; Incidence; Infections; Noncommunicable Diseases; Poverty; Recurrence; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Urban Population; Urbanization","R24 TW008910","NA","<b>Financial Conflicts:</b> None. <b>Conflicts of Interest:</b> None","Stephen W Bickler, Andrew Wang, Said Amin, Jonathan Halbach, Radhames Lizardo, David M Cauvi, Antonio De Maio","Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, University of California, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA."

Yet most extant samples are small or based upon low-risk populations, and few studies address the potential role of maternal weight during pregnancy in their study designs or sampling strategy. Here we report basal and reactivity levels of salivary cortisol within a racially and ethnically diverse sample of 132 infants approximately one month of age (Age in days: M=37.61, SD=7.27) born to lower income overweight or obese mothers. Reactivity was assessed in response to a multi-domain infant stressor paradigm, which included assessment via the Newborn Behavioral Observation (NBO) system and extensive anthropometric measurements. Sample means for basal, post stressors, and reactivity to the NBO were significantly lower than those reported in reviews of low-risk samples. Parity was associated with cortisol levels such that first-born infants had lower resting cortisol and higher reactivity than infants born to multiparous women. Latino infants had lower basal cortisol. No other demographic characteristics significantly predicted cortisol. The variability in cortisol levels present in this sample suggests that considerable psychophysiological diversity may exist in samples of low-SES or high-risk participants.

In concert with chronic visceral pain, there is a high comorbidity with stress-related psychiatric disorders including anxiety and depression. The mechanisms linking visceral pain with these overlapping comorbidities remain to be elucidated. Evidence suggests that long term stress facilitates pain perception and sensitizes pain pathways, leading to a feed-forward cycle promoting chronic visceral pain disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Early life stress (ELS) is a risk-factor for the development of IBS, however the mechanisms responsible for the persistent effects of ELS on visceral perception in adulthood remain incompletely understood. In rodent models, stress in adult animals induced by restraint and water avoidance has been employed to investigate the mechanisms of stress-induce pain. ELS models such as maternal separation, limited nesting, or odor-shock conditioning, which attempt to model early childhood experiences such as neglect, poverty, or an abusive caregiver, can produce chronic, sexually dimorphic increases in visceral sensitivity in adulthood. Chronic visceral pain is a classic example of gene &#xd7; environment interaction which results from maladaptive changes in neuronal circuitry leading to neuroplasticity and aberrant neuronal activity-induced signaling. One potential mechanism underlying the persistent effects of stress on visceral sensitivity could be epigenetic modulation of gene expression. While there are relatively few studies examining epigenetically mediated mechanisms involved in visceral nociception, stress-induced visceral pain has been linked to alterations in DNA methylation and histone acetylation patterns within the brain, leading to increased expression of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters. This review will discuss the potential neuronal pathways and mechanisms responsible for stress-induced exacerbation of chronic visceral pain. Additionally, we will review the importance of specific experimental models of adult stress and ELS in enhancing our understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms of pain processing.",NA,NA,"I01 BX001195; I01 BX002188; IK2 BX003630; IK6 BX003610","10.1152/ajprenal.00297.2015; 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2010.04409.x; 10.1016/j.pain.2008.12.007; 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2011.01865.x; 10.1111/nmo.12154; 10.1111/nmo.13081; 10.1016/j.pain.2004.10.002; 10.1136/gut.2005.084194; 10.1111/bph.13352; 10.1111/bph.13348; 10.1111/bph.13355; 10.1111/bph.13350; 10.1016/j.brainres.2003.10.073; 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2005.12.002; 10.1016/S0306-4522(99)00445-5; 10.1007/s00406-005-0624-4; 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2011.01805.x; 10.1097/01.ASW.0000358637.38161.8f; 10.1007/s00418-013-1081-1; 10.1046/j.1365-2826.2001.00698.x; 10.1053/j.gastro.2016.02.028; 10.1111/nmo.13148; 10.1093/brain/awr288; 10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.033; 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.06.004; 10.1046/j.1365-2982.2002.00305.x; 10.1371/journal.pone.0130938; 10.1053/j.gastro.2006.01.037; 10.1016/j.pain.2006.10.028; 10.1152/ajpgi.90557.2008; 10.1152/ajpgi.00500.2004; 10.1016/j.cgh.2011.12.018; 10.1016/j.neuron.2014.01.018; 10.1152/ajpgi.00437.2016; 10.1038/nrgastro.2013.29; 10.1038/nrn3516; 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2009.04.003; 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2012.01921.x; 10.1002/dev.420210103; 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307748; 10.1177/1744806916660722; 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-310971; 10.1016/j.jpain.2012.11.008; 10.1053/j.gastro.2005.09.071; 10.1007/s10620-008-0575-5; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.06.024; 10.1152/ajpgi.00240.2001; 10.1016/0006-8993(95)00525-U; 10.1152/ajpgi.00290.2013; 10.1111/jam.13320; 10.1038/nrn1683; 10.1038/nn.3628; 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2007.05987.x; 10.1097/ALN.0b013e3182700383; 10.1016/0145-2134(96)00091-9; 10.1038/ajg.2011.201; 10.7326/0003-4819-113-11-828; 10.1016/j.bcp.2004.06.037; 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2009.01385.x; 10.1210/en.2010-0285; 10.1126/science.1121158; 10.1111/nmo.12272; 10.1371/journal.pone.0085073; 10.1046/j.1365-2982.2003.00420.x; 10.2165/11630070-000000000-00000; 10.1016/j.yexmp.2014.04.009; 10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.11.075; 10.1111/nmo.12458; 10.1016/0887-8994(96)00153-1; 10.1002/da.20605; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.12.002; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.03.004; 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2008.12.007; 10.1038/nri3621; 10.1016/S0006-8993(00)03305-9; 10.1152/ajpgi.00463.2014; 10.1016/B978-0-12-803239-8.00041-7; 10.1038/srep07642; 10.1016/j.brainres.2007.08.030; 10.1046/j.1365-2982.1997.d01-63.x; 10.1016/j.yfrne.2014.06.001; 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000089; 10.1152/ajpgi.00349.2010; 10.1016/j.yfrne.2007.10.004; 10.1210/en.2011-1470; 10.1006/hbeh.1994.1044; 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2008.12.009; 10.1016/j.genm.2009.03.004; 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2008.02.020; 10.1016/S0166-2236(96)10069-2; 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2009.11.001; 10.1002/ejp.847; 10.1016/j.ynstr.2015.12.003; 10.1136/gut.2008.157594; 10.1053/j.gastro.2014.09.032; 10.1053/j.gastro.2010.11.003; 10.1016/j.mayocp.2016.04.029; 10.1016/j.nicl.2017.06.001; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.04.019; 10.1016/j.brainres.2011.01.002; 10.1152/jn.00135.2007; 10.1152/jn.01148.2007; 10.1111/nmo.12549; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.04.070; 10.3748/wjg.v19.i22.3487; 10.4172/2157-7536.1000e109; 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2015.01.018; 10.1007/164_2016_120; 10.1371/journal.pone.0008573; 10.1038/tp.2015.16; 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2012.01899.x; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.06.050; 10.1111/bph.13740; 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2016.11.016; 10.1111/j.1572-0241.1998.540_i.x; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2017.01.021; 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2017.08.023; 10.1073/pnas.0507572102; 10.1016/S0006-8993(96)01108-0; 10.1038/nm.2231; 10.1016/S0022-3999(02)00399-9; 10.1152/ajpgi.00072.2009; 10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.11.045; 10.1037/a0019712; 10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.11.102; 10.1124/jpet.115.231670; 10.3748/wjg.v21.i23.7181; 10.1186/s13041-015-0169-z; 10.1111/nmo.13170; 10.1124/pr.58.4.9; 10.1111/ejn.12440; 10.1159/000375454; 10.1016/j.clinph.2014.10.004; 10.1111/j.1526-4610.2012.02209.x; 10.1007/s00210-017-1384-1; 10.3748/wjg.v21.i3.836; 10.1038/sj.npp.1301200; 10.3748/wjg.v20.i22.6725; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5540-03.2004; 10.1136/gut.2004.051391; 10.1371/journal.pone.0073749; 10.1038/srep19399; 10.1007/s40272-014-0080-6; 10.12980/APJTB.4.2014C205; 10.1073/pnas.0705615105; 10.1111/nmo.12675; 10.1016/j.brainres.2011.12.049; 10.1037/0735-7044.118.2.274; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0499-06.2006; 10.2147/JPR.S60433",NA,"Beverley Greenwood-Van Meerveld, Anthony C Johnson","VA Medical Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States."

Our analysis showed that service user and caregiver involvement in the health system strengthening process was an alien concept for most participants. They reported very limited access to direct participation. Stigma and poverty were described as the main barriers for involvement. Several strategies were identified by participants to overcome existing hurdles to facilitate service user and caregiver involvement in the mental health system strengthening process, such as support to access treatment, mental health promotion and empowerment of service users. This study suggests that capacity building for service users, and strengthening of user groups would equip them to contribute meaningfully to policy development from informed perspectives. Involvement of service users and their caregivers in mental health decision-making is still in its infancy in LMICs.

Some doubts have been expressed in recent years about the value and the wide acceptance of the biopsychosocial model. Ghaemi (2009)1 considers it to be anti-humanistic and advocates the use of less eclectic, less generic, and less vague alternatives. The fundamental changes that have been witnessed in our times across the spectrum of biology, psychology and sociology have made necessary that a conceptual clarity should prevail. The remarkable advances in neurosciences, neurobiology and genetics tend to swing the emphasis towards a more biological basis. Psychosis for example is the condition often regarded as being biologically constructed and most independent of the social context. The symptoms, however, of hallucinations and delusions in psychosis have social meaning for the person experiencing them and are primarily defined socially.2 Furthermore, vulnerability is often the result of social trauma, whether in the form of recent stressors that trigger onset, or earlier circumstances that shape cognitive and emotional style. Moreover, the approved treatment and management of long term psychiatric disorders has involved interventions that are either directly social, or psychosocial. Furthermore, doubts have also been raised by the endophenotype project,3 related to the genetics of schizophrenia. Cohen4 suggested that there may be more individual genotypic patterns associated with schizophrenia than people with schizophrenia on the planet. A recent alternative interpretation (network approach) is gaining some support. It suggests that a stressor causes symptoms that activate other symptoms, in a circular, self-reinforcing way.5 This theory moves away from psychiatric disorders being traditionally conceptualised as categorical or dimensional models. While psychiatry has shifted its focus to a more biological approach, social factors still have an important role in crosscultural diagnosis, psychiatric disorders relating to social deprivation, rehabilitation and enabling social inclusion. The degree to which society is willing to accept people with mental health problems has an obvious impact on their quality of life. We live in a period of cataclysmic social changes with disastrous wars, increased poverty and growing income inequality. The consequences on mental health are phenomenal with epidemics of self-harm and suicidality, higher rates of depression, and intensifying diagnosis of mood and conduct disorders in children and young adults. Other adversities include the disproportional number of people with mental health problems in prisons and penal institutions, the massive escalation of dementia sufferers and the shortcomings of the aspirations of community mental health care. In addition, there is an escalating social pathology with significant numbers of refugees and asylum seekers and rising numbers of homeless particularly in urban areas of the developed world. We should not, however, overlook the better rates of treatment for mental health problems, the emphasis on human rights, the empowerment and the service users' participation and the development in global mental health. All these social factors are important to contemporary psychiatry presenting complex challenges and demanding urgent attention and action.6 There is a need to embrace the development of evidence-based mental health services and a pluralistic approach, which balances appropriately the relevance of biological, psychological and social factors associated with mental health problems. The concept Meta-Community mental health builds on the successes of biological, psychological, social and community psychiatry.7 It incorporates neurosciences, sociology, psychology and anthropology and is delivered wherever the evidence shows that it makes a difference, whether in community or hospital, prisons, schools, court-room, place of work, refugee camp or battle-front. New technologies should be included for public information and education together with e-mental health, training of providers, tele-psychiatry and self-help methods delivered via IT. The boundaries of mental health are enlarging very rapidly and indeed new stakeholders and partners should be welcomed. This opens exciting possibilities but also creates some risks and strong evidence base should continue to guide us. Likelihood of finding early diagnostic and individualized treatment for psychosis, autism and dementia are likely to be of high financial cost. The importance of the social challenges of modern psychiatry was recognised by including mental health for the first time in the New Sustainable Development Goals of United Nations that will determine the global development by 2030 aiming at the promotion of life expectancy for all.8 Strengthening the prevention and treatment of mental health problems is a massive task for sustainable development as mental health has a direct impact on the whole range of Sustainable Development Goals.","D006115; D006801; D011570; D011618; D012559; D012944","Greece; Humans; Psychiatry; Psychotic Disorders; Schizophrenia; Social Support",NA,"NA",NA,"N Bouras","Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry-King's College, London, UK."

PA was assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and participants were dichotomized into those who do (&#x2265;150min moderate-vigorous PA per week) and do not (&lt;150min=low PA) comply with the World Health Organization (WHO) PA recommendations. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the PA correlates. The prevalence of low PA in 206,356 persons (mean age 38.4years; 49.6% males) was 29.2% (95%CI=28.3%-30.0%). In the overall sample, female sex, not married/cohabiting, high education and wealth, unemployment, and urban setting were significant sociodemographic correlates of low PA. In terms of other correlates, inadequate fruit and vegetable intake, subsyndromal depression, worse sleep/energy and cognition, visual impairment, hearing problems and asthma were associated with not meeting the WHO recommendations. There were some variations in the correlates depending on age and sex. Interventions should be developed that operate at multiple levels of influence and take into account age- and gender-related PA patterns in order to assist people in LMICs to comply with the WHO PA recommendations.

We aim to systematically review and appraise published literature to determine reported outcomes and identify predictors of outcome following VPS in relevant subgroups of HIV-infected adults. The following electronic databases will be searched: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), LILACS (BIREME), Research Registry ( www.researchregistry.com ), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) ( www.controlled-trials.com ), ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) and OpenSIGLE database.

Little is known about whether text messaging parents of children enrolled in obesity treatment will improve child health. We conducted a 2-group randomized controlled study among 101 children aged 5-12 and their parent/guardian enrolling in tertiary-care obesity treatment. Participants were randomized to standard care or standard care plus daily motivational interviewing-based text messages. The primary outcome was change in child BMI at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included feasibility, health behaviors, attrition, motivation, and parent BMI. We enrolled 101 parent-child dyads and retained 81% to 3-month follow-up. Child participants had a mean age of 9.9 years, and baseline BMI of 30.5&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Half (48%) of participants were Black, and 64% of parent participants had a high school equivalent education or less. Ninety-nine percent of parents owned a mobile device with unlimited text messaging. Parents responded to 80% of texts, and 95% felt the texts ""always"" or ""almost always"" helped them make a good health decision. We observed no between-group difference in child zBMI from baseline to 3 months (0.0 vs. 0.2, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.2). Intervention participants had significantly better adherence to clinic visits (3.3 visits vs. 2.1 visits/3 months, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Parent-directed text messages did not significantly change child BMI. However, texting significantly reduced attrition for treatment visits. Nearly all parents in this racially diverse, low-income sample engaged in daily text messaging, making this a feasible approach.","D001521; D044383; D015992; D002648; D002675; D004522; D005260; D015438; D006630; D006801; D008297; D009042; D062405; D010287; D010290; D063766; D011203; D016037; D063128; D060145","Behavior Therapy; Black People; Body Mass Index; Child; Child, Preschool; Educational Status; Female; Health Behavior; Hispanic or Latino; Humans; Male; Motivation; Motivational Interviewing; Parent-Child Relations; Parents; Pediatric Obesity; Poverty; Single-Blind Method; Tertiary Healthcare; Text Messaging",NA,"NA",NA,"Sarah Armstrong, Alan Mendelsohn, Gary Bennett, Elsie M Taveras, Amanda Kimberg, Alex R Kemper","7 Division of Ambulatory Pediatrics, Nationwide Children's Hospital , Columbus, OH."

We also sought to examine cytokine expression in the serum of women with pre-eclampsia, which is the most common HDP, and whether exposure of foetal neurons to this serum could change patterns of neuronal growth. HDP were reported by mothers 9&#xa0;months post-delivery. ASD was parent reported at age seven, based on a doctor or health care professional's diagnosis. Weighted logistic regression was used for data analysis, adjusting for several potential confounders including maternal alcohol consumption, education, depression, age, and poverty status. Sensitivity analyses were performed excluding pre-term births, small for gestational age (SGA), and pre-pregnancy hypertension and depression. There was a significant association between HDP and a twofold increased risk of ASD (AOR&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.10 [95% CI 1.20-3.70]). Excluding preterm births, SGA births, and offspring of women who had pre-pregnancy hypertension or over the age of 40 did not change the results materially. At the cellular level, exposure of foetal cortical neurons to 3% serum isolated from women with an established HDP increased neuronal growth and branching in vitro.

When children were 6, 15 and 24 months of age, mothers reported their level of depressive symptomatology. At 24 and 36 months of age, mother-child interactions during play were rated for warmth-sensitivity and harsh-intrusiveness, and dyadic joint attention and maternal language complexity were assessed from a book sharing activity. Children's EF (i.e., inhibitory control, working memory, and set shifting) were assessed at ages 36 and 48 months using a battery of six tasks. Results indicated that MDS at ages 15 and 24 months were negatively associated with children's EF at age 48 months. Additionally, harsh-intrusive mother-child interactions partially mediated this link. Although warmth-sensitivity, dyadic joint attention and maternal language complexity were all longitudinally related to EF, they did not serve as mediating mechanisms between MDS and EF. These results were obtained while controlling for multiple demographic factors, children's earlier cognitive abilities, maternal general distress and childcare experiences. Findings from this study identify 1 mechanism through which early exposure to MDS could be related to children's EF.

Most respondents reported improved access to care, usually equated with medication, and were motivated to remain engaged due to experienced benefits of care. However, four main barriers to engagement emerged. (1) Poverty: resulting in inability to pay for medication and undermining vital social support affected engagement for all respondents. (2) Unreliable medication supplies and lack of second line options for inadequate response or intolerable side-effects. (3) The long-term nature of the illness: expectations of cure, stigma of chronic illness, low awareness about the illness and treatment and declining social support over time. (4) The nature of SMD: difficulty conveying the person when acutely disturbed and no flexibility for proactive outreach or legal frameworks to provide care when patients lacked capacity. In those who never engaged, geographical inaccessibility was an important barrier. Alternative cultural explanations for illness were only mentioned as a barrier only by two of the respondents. Economic interventions may be needed to support ongoing engagement in care for people with SMD. Systems of care for chronic illness need to be strengthened in combination with legal frameworks. Expanded options for affordable and effective medication and psychosocial interventions are required for person-centred care.","D000293; D000328; D000368; D005002; D005260; D054625; D006801; D008297; D001523; D008605; D008875; D036301; D012424; D012959; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Ethiopia; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult",NA,"10.1093/schbul/sbp046; 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61404-X; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.07.057; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61093-3; 10.1080/18374905.2014.11081896; 10.1186/s12939-016-0410-0; 10.1177/160940690400300104; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1999.tb10687.x; 10.1016/j.jad.2005.03.011; 10.1186/s12875-017-0628-y; 10.1371/journal.pone.0126666; 10.1007/s10488-013-0528-y; 10.1186/1471-2288-8-73; 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.04.027; 10.1007/s00127-012-0587-5; 10.1093/heapol/czw084; 10.1371/journal.pone.0116897; 10.1001/jama.298.16.1900; 10.1093/heapol/czu142; 10.1093/wber/lhv009; 10.1016/S0306-9192(01)00014-8; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.08.044; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001166; 10.4314/ajpsy.v11i3.30227; 10.1017/S2045796015000803; 10.1186/s13063-016-1427-9; 10.1371/journal.pone.0143572; 10.1176/ps.2010.61.10.1028; 10.1007/s11013-012-9270-2; 10.1016/j.healthpol.2011.10.006; 10.1136/qshc.2004.010744; 10.1186/s12888-016-0981-8; 10.1093/heapol/czv072; 10.1186/s12913-016-1323-8; 10.1186/s12916-015-0309-4; 10.1186/1471-244X-11-165; 10.1016/S0140-6736(71)92410-X; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61458-X; 10.1016/j.ijlp.2013.11.024","ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the College of Health Sciences of Addis Ababa University.

To date, correlates of independent outdoor play have not been investigated. This study aimed to identify potential demographic, behavioural, environmental and social correlates of children's independent outdoor play. Data were from the Millennium Cohort Study when children were aged 7&#xa0;years. Parents reported whether their children played out unsupervised (yes/no) as well as the above mentioned correlates of unsupervised outdoor play. Children's physical activity levels were measured using waist worn accelerometry. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine associations between correlates and odds of independent (unsupervised) outdoor play. Adjusted multiple linear regression was used to estimate associations between independent outdoor play and objective measures of physical activity. Activity was measured as average daily moderate-to-vigorous activity, steps, and sedentary behaviour. 3856 (<i>n</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;29%) participants were categorised as engaging in independent outdoor play. Older age, being white British, being in poverty, living in close proximity to both family friends and family, having fewer internalising problems, having more externalising conduct problems and fewer pro-social behaviours were associated with higher odds of independent outdoor play. Independent outdoor play was associated with &gt;&#xa0;2 additional minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity (B&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.21 95% CI, 1.09 to 3.34), &gt;&#xa0;330 additional steps per day (B&#xa0;=&#xa0;336.66 95% CI 209.80 to 463.51), and nearly 5&#xa0;min less time spent sedentary per day (B&#xa0;=&#xa0;-&#xa0;4.91 95% CI -&#xa0;7.54, -&#xa0;2.29) Younger children, those from a higher socio-economic-status, those isolated in location from family friends and family, and those with high levels of prosocial behaviour have lower levels of independent outdoor play.

This study aimed to identify which young women are at the greatest risk of repeat unintended pregnancies; which interventions are effective and cost-effective; and what are the barriers to and facilitators for the uptake of these interventions. We conducted a mixed-methods systematic review which included meta-analysis, framework synthesis and application of realist principles, with stakeholder input and service user feedback to address this. We searched 20 electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica database, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts and Research Papers in Economics, to cover a broad range of health, social science, health economics and grey literature sources. Searches were conducted between May 2013 and June 2014 and updated in August 2015. Twelve randomised controlled trials (RCTs), two quasi-RCTs, 10 qualitative studies and 53 other quantitative studies were identified. The RCTs evaluated psychosocial interventions and an emergency contraception programme. The primary outcome was repeat conception rate: the event rate was 132 of 308 (43%) in the intervention group versus 140 of 289 (48%) for the control group, with a non-significant risk ratio (RR) of 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-1.08]. Four studies reported subsequent birth rates: 29 of 237 (12%) events for the intervention arm versus 46 out of 224 (21%) for the control arm, with an RR of 0.60 (95% CI 0.39-0.93). Many repeat conceptions occurred in the context of poverty, low expectations and aspirations and negligible opportunities. Qualitative and realist evidence highlighted the importance of context, motivation, future planning and giving young women a central and active role in the development of new interventions. Little or no evidence for the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of any of the interventions to reduce repeat pregnancy in young women was found. Qualitative and realist evidence helped to explain gaps in intervention design that should be addressed. More theory-based, rigorously evaluated programmes need to be developed to reduce unintended repeat pregnancy in young women. PROSPERO, CRD42012003168 .

Participants included women from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study who were involved in an intimate relationship at some point by the time their twin children were 10 years old. Women were initially interviewed in 1999-2000 (mean age = 33 years) and 2, 5, and 7 years later. They reported on their physical and mental health, and their health-risk behaviours. Compared with women who did not experience abuse in childhood, women with histories of maltreatment were at elevated risk for mental, physical, and health-risk behaviours, including major depressive disorder, sleep, and substance use problems. Cumulatively, safe, supportive, and nurturing relationships characterized by a lack of violence, emotional intimacy, and social support buffered women with a history of maltreatment from poor health outcomes. Our findings emphasize that negative social determinants of health - such as a childhood history of maltreatment - confer risk for psychopathology and other physical health problems. If, however, a woman's current social circumstances are sufficiently positive, they can promote good health, particularly in the face of past adversity.","D000328; D054523; D001008; D003865; D004739; D005260; D006304; D006801; D007398; D008137; D011203; D065840; D012307; D012747; D012893; D012944; D019966; D014852","Adult; Adult Survivors of Child Abuse; Anxiety Disorders; Depressive Disorder, Major; England; Female; Health Status; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Longitudinal Studies; Poverty; Protective Factors; Risk Factors; Sexual Partners; Sleep Wake Disorders; Social Support; Substance-Related Disorders; Wales","G1002190; R01 HD077482","10.1111/jcpp.12621","<b>Declaration of interest:</b> None. <b>Conflict of interest:</b> None","S R Jaffee, R Takizawa, L Arseneault","MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre,Institute of Psychiatry,Psychology and Neuroscience,King's College London,London SE5 8AF,UK."

This study conducted a process evaluation exploring the perceptions of counsellors who delivered a task shared psycho-social counselling intervention for perinatal depression in Khayelitsha, Cape Town together with independent fidelity ratings. Post intervention qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with six counsellors from the AFrica Focus on Intervention Research for Mental health (AFFIRM-SA) randomised controlled trial on their perceptions of delivering a task shared psycho-social intervention for perinatal depression. Themes were identified using the framework approach and were coded and analysed using Nvivo v11. These interviews were supplemented with fidelity ratings for each counsellor and supervision notes. Facilitating factors in the delivery of the intervention included intervention related factors such as: the content of the intervention, ongoing training and supervision, using a counselling manual, conducting counselling sessions in the local language (isiXhosa) and fidelity to the manual; counsellor factors included counsellors' confidence and motivation to conduct the sessions; participant factors included older age, commitment and a desire to be helped. Barriers included contextual factors such as poverty, crime and lack of space to conduct counselling sessions and participant factors such as the nature of the participant's problem, young age, and avoidance of contact with counsellors. Fidelity ratings and dropout rates varied substantially between counsellors.

The research priority areas identified include: (1) assessment of how nutrition, infection, or inflammation in the preconception, prenatal, and infancy periods (or interventions in these periods) affect function in early to middle childhood; (2) assessment of whether effects of nutritional interventions vary by poverty or inflammation; (3) determination of the feasibility of preschool- and school-based integrated nutritional interventions; (4) improved assessment of the epidemiology of infection- and inflammation-related neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI); (5) identification of mechanisms through which infection causes NDI; (6) identification of noninfectious causes of inflammation-related NDI and interventions for causes already identified (eg, environmental factors); and (7) studies on the effects of interactions between nutritional, infectious, and inflammatory factors on neurodevelopment in early to middle childhood. Areas of emerging importance that require additional study include the effects of maternal Zika virus infection, childhood environmental enteropathy, and alterations in the child's microbiome on neurodevelopment in early to middle childhood.

However, there is little evidence from LMICs to guide this process. The aim of this study was to explore barriers to, and facilitators of, service user/caregiver involvement in rural Ethiopia to inform the development of a scalable approach. Thirty nine semi-structured interviews were carried out with purposively selected mental health service users (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;13), caregivers (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;10), heads of primary care facilities (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;8) and policy makers/planners/service developers (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;8). The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed in Amharic, and translated into English. Thematic analysis was applied. All groups of participants supported service user and caregiver involvement in mental health system strengthening. Potential benefits were identified as (i) improved appropriateness and quality of services, and (ii) greater protection against mistreatment and promotion of respect for service users. However, hardly any respondents had prior experience of service user involvement. Stigma was considered to be a pervasive barrier, operating within the health system, the local community and individuals. Competing priorities of service users included the need to obtain adequate individual care and to work for survival. Low recognition of the potential contribution of service users seemed linked to limited empowerment and mobilization of service users. Potential health system facilitators included a culture of community oversight of primary care services. All groups of respondents identified a need for awareness-raising and training to equip service users, caregivers, service providers and local community for involvement. Empowerment at the level of individual service users (information about mental health conditions, care and rights) and the group level (for advocacy and representation) were considered essential, alongside improved, accessible mental health care and livelihood interventions. As Ethiopia increases access to mental health care, a fundamental barrier to service user involvement is beginning to be addressed. Our study identified further barriers that need to be tackled, including a supportive political climate, and receptiveness amongst stakeholders. The findings will inform the development of a model of service user involvement, which will be piloted and evaluated.","D044383; D017028; D005002; D005260; D006297; D006801; D008297; D001523; D008603; D008605; D011203; D011320; D036301; D012424; D057545","Black People; Caregivers; Ethiopia; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Poverty; Primary Health Care; Qualitative Research; Rural Population; Social Stigma",NA,"10.1111/j.1369-7625.2011.00743.x; 10.1186/1756-0500-7-37; 10.1371/journal.pone.0150742; 10.1136/bmj.325.7375.1263; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61263-X; 10.1002/j.2051-5545.2010.tb00276.x; 10.1002/j.2051-5545.2010.tb00308.x; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001261; 10.1186/s12913-016-1323-8; 10.1186/1472-698X-13-17; 10.1093/schbul/sbn029; 10.1016/j.schres.2005.05.028; 10.1016/j.schres.2014.10.053; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001359; 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; 10.1093/heapol/czv072; 10.1186/s13033-015-0032-8; 10.3109/09540261.2010.536153; 10.4103/0971-9962.181095; 10.1007/s00127-013-0729-4; 10.1002/j.2051-5545.2011.tb00062.x; 10.1371/journal.pone.0088437; 10.1192/bjp.bp.114.153676; 10.1093/inthealth/ihs037; 10.1080/17441692.2011.651733; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61458-X",NA,"Sisay Abayneh, Heidi Lempp, Atalay Alem, Daniel Alemayehu, Tigist Eshetu, Crick Lund, Maya Semrau, Graham Thornicroft, Charlotte Hanlon","Department of Psychiatry, University College of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia."

Significant sex disparities have been identified for affective pathology, with females having an increased risk of developing anxiety and depressive disorder. However, the effects of early life stress (ELS) on cognitive development have not been as well characterized, especially in reference to sex specific impacts of ELS on cognitive abilities over development. In mice, fragmented maternal care resulting from maternal bedding restriction, was used to induce ELS. The development of spatial abilities were tracked using a novel object placement (NOP) task at several different ages across early development (P21, P28, P38, P50, and P75). Male mice exposed to ELS showed significant impairments in the NOP task compared with control reared mice at all ages tested. In female mice, ELS led to impaired NOP performance immediately following weaning (P21) and during peri-adolescence (P38), but these effects did not persist into early adulthood. Prior work has implicated impaired hippocampus neurogenesis as a possible mediator of negative outcomes in ELS males. In the hippocampus of behaviorally na&#xef;ve animals there was a significant decrease in expression of Ki-67 (proliferative marker) and doublecortin (DCX-immature cell marker) as mice aged, and a more rapid developmental decline in these markers in ELS reared mice. However, the effect of ELS dissipated by P28 and no main effect of sex were observed.

These results emphasise the importance of understanding the social mechanisms of suicide and the need for effective interventions early in life, aiming to alleviate the risk in disadvantaged children.","D000293; D000069586; D015331; D003643; D004522; D054242; D005260; D005500; D006801; D015994; D008297; D010290; D011203; D012042; D012307; D013315; D019966; D013405; D013548; D055815","Adolescent; Adult Survivors of Child Adverse Events; Cohort Studies; Death; Educational Status; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Male; Parents; Poverty; Registries; Risk Factors; Stress, Psychological; Substance-Related Disorders; Suicide; Sweden; Young Adult",NA,"NA","Competing interests: All authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure form at www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf (available on request from the corresponding author) and declare: no other financial relationships with any organisations that might have an interest in the submitted work in the previous three years: no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.","Charlotte Bj&#xf6;rkenstam, Kyriaki Kosidou, Emma Bj&#xf6;rkenstam","Department of Community Health Sciences, Fielding School of Public Health and California Center for Population Research, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."

The validated 92-item Portuguese version of the Prodromal Questionnaire (PQ) was used for face-to-face interviews. Latent class analysis was conducted. Mean age was of 24 years; 51.1% of the sample was of women. Mean total score on the PQ was 22.06 (SD=17.16). Considering a suggested cut-off of 14 in the positive subscale, 30.8% of individuals were above the threshold for ultra-high risk for psychosis detection. Latent class analysis resulted in a three classes clusterization. Class 1 (20%; n=390) had the highest overall PQ scores (mean=49.31,SD=10.783), class 2 (43%; n=835) had intermediate scores (mean=23.37,SD=6.56), and class 3 (37%; n=721) had the lowest scores (mean=5.81,SD=3.74).

Using a large (N = 34,653), nationally representative US adult sample, the 2004-2005 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, we examined whether individuals who first attempted suicide during childhood (under the age of 13 years) differ from those who first attempted suicide during adolescence (13 through 17 years) in (1) contributing factors for first suicide attempt, including mental disorders and traumatic experiences that occurred before the first suicide attempt, parental history of mental disorders, and family poverty and (2) adulthood mental health outcomes, including lifetime and current prevalence of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders and quality of life measures. Suicide attempts during childhood (n = 104) were more strongly related to childhood maltreatment, while suicide attempts during adolescence (n = 415) were more strongly associated with major depressive episode. Compared to first suicide attempts during adolescence, first attempts during childhood were associated with increased risk for multiple suicide attempts (61.3% vs 32.6%), several psychiatric disorders (mania, hypomania, and panic disorder), and poorer social functioning during adulthood (all P values &lt; .05). Suicide attempts in children and adolescents substantially differ in contributing factors and adulthood mental health outcomes. Preventing childhood maltreatment and early intervention for psychiatric disorders may have broad benefits to reduce not only the suffering of these children and adolescents, but also the burden of suicide.","D000293; D000328; D054523; D000367; D000368; D002648; D016241; D003865; D005260; D006801; D008297; D001523; D008875; D010290; D011203; D015995; D012307; D013406; D014481; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Adult Survivors of Child Abuse; Age Factors; Aged; Child; Child of Impaired Parents; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Parents; Poverty; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Suicide, Attempted; United States; Young Adult",NA,"NA",NA,"Hugo Peyre, Nicolas Hoertel, Coline Stordeur, Ga&#xeb;le Lebeau, Carlos Blanco, Kibby McMahon, Romain Basmaci, C&#xe9;dric Lemogne, Fr&#xe9;d&#xe9;ric Limosin, Richard Delorme","Assistance Publique-H&#xf4;pitaux de Paris, Robert Debr&#xe9; Hospital, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department, Paris, France."

The measured reactivity depends on the quantity of sweat secreted by those eccrine sweat glands that are located in the hypodermis of palmar and plantar regions. Electrodermal hyporeactive individuals are those who show an unusual rapid habituation to identical non-significant stimuli. Previous findings suggested that electrodermal hyporeactivity has a high sensitivity and a high specificity for suicide. The aims of the present study are to test the effectiveness and the usefulness of the EDOR (ElectroDermal Orienting Reactivity) Test as a support in the suicide risk assessment of depressed patients and to assess the predictive value of electrodermal hyporeactivity, measured through the EDOR Test, for suicide and suicide attempt in adult patients with a primary diagnosis of depression. 1573 patients with a primary diagnosis of depression, whether currently depressed or in remission, have been recruited at 15 centres in 9 different European countries. Depressive symptomatology was evaluated through the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale. Previous suicide attempts were registered and the suicide intent of the worst attempt was rated according to the first eight items of the Beck Suicide Intent Scale. The suicide risk was also assessed according to rules and traditions at the centre. The EDOR Test was finally performed. During the EDOR Test, two fingers are put on gold electrodes and direct current of 0.5 V is passed through the epidermis of the fingers according to standards. A moderately strong tone is presented through headphones now and then during the test. The electrodermal responses to the stimuli represent an increase in the conductance due to the increased number of filled sweat ducts that act as conductors through the electrically highly resistant epidermis. Each patient is followed up for one year in order to assess the occurrence of intentional self-harm. Based on previous studies, expected results would be that patients realizing a suicide attempt with a strong intent or committing suicide should be electrodermally hyporeactive in most cases and non-hyporeactive patients should show only few indications of death intent or suicides.

Patient's responses to their experiences of using services are under-researched in the context of mental healthcare in low income countries. Our aim was to use mixed methods to develop a new measure of satisfaction for use among consumers of the new models of mental healthcare which are currently being scaled-up. We used qualitative methods to explore the concept of service satisfaction. On the basis of these findings, we developed a new 'Mental health service satisfaction scale' (MHSSS v0.0) by adapting existing measures of service satisfaction. We evaluated psychometric properties of the new measure, among a sample of service users with severe mental disorder (SMD) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;200) and caregivers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;200). Following expert review, a modified version of the measure was developed (MHSSS v1.0) and psychometric properties were examined with data from a second independent sample (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;150 service users with SMD and n&#x2009;=&#x2009;150 caregivers). Factors identified in analysis of the first quantitative sample coincide with core concepts of service satisfaction as reported in the literature and were reflected in the key themes which emerged from our qualitative study: interpersonal factors, efficacy, communication, technical competency and adequacy of facilities. There was generally consensus among caregivers and service users regarding dimensions of satisfaction. However there was evidence of some differences in prioritization. Revisions made to version 0.0 of the Mental Health Service Satisfaction Scale (MHSSS) led to an improved instrument, with excellent internal consistency, convergent validity and factor loadings indicative of a uni-dimensional construct. Our findings suggest that conceptions of service satisfaction among people accessing a service for SMD are broadly similar with those established in the literature. Our findings indicate that the MHSSS might be a useful candidate for inclusion in the new toolkit of measures needed to facilitate monitoring of service satisfaction which will be crucial to quality improvement.","D017028; D003142; D003156; D003219; D005002; D005260; D006801; D008297; D001523; D008875; D010353; D017060; D010549; D011203; D011369; D011594; D019035","Caregivers; Communication; Community Mental Health Services; Confidentiality; Ethiopia; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Patient Education as Topic; Patient Satisfaction; Personal Satisfaction; Poverty; Professional-Patient Relations; Psychometrics; Rural Health Services","U19 MH095699","10.1001/jama.1988.03410120089033; 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2013.12.010; 10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00210-0; 10.1097/00005650-198407000-00011; 10.4102/curationis.v20i2.1302; 10.1016/0149-7189(83)90005-8; 10.1093/oxfordjournals.schbul.a007000; 10.1016/j.psychres.2014.01.045; 10.1097/00005650-198601000-00007; 10.1371/journal.pone.0100153; 10.1186/1756-0500-7-657; 10.3109/09540261.2010.545990; 10.1017/S2045796015000281; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001359; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61238-0; 10.1186/1472-6963-14-113; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.07.057; 10.2471/BLT.16.170605; 10.1093/heapol/17.1.42; 10.1093/intqhc/10.2.93; 10.1093/intqhc/mzr019; 10.1017/S0033291700028609; 10.1007/s00127-003-0606-7; 10.1186/s13063-016-1191-x; 10.7748/nr2011.01.18.2.52.c8284; 10.1097/00005053-199309000-00004; 10.1177/001316446002000104; 10.2307/2529310; 10.1093/heapol/czv072; 10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00235-5; 10.1111/j.1440-0979.2005.00363.x; 10.1046/j.1440-0979.2003.00276.x; 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.083733; 10.1007/s00127-006-0123-6; 10.1007/s10597-013-9667-6; 10.1080/00048670802653349; 10.1377/hlthaff.15.4.42",NA,"Rosie Mayston, Kassahun Habtamu, Girmay Medhin, Atalay Alem, Abebaw Fekadu, Alehegn Habtamu, Martin Prince, Charlotte Hanlon","King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Centre for Global Mental Health, London, UK."

Multiadjusted risks for all psychiatric disorders, as well as for specific psychiatric diagnoses, were calculated as HRs with 95% CIs. Of the 5 identified income trajectories, the constant low and the downward trajectories were particularly associated with later psychiatric disorder. Children with these trajectories had increased risks for psychiatric disorder, including mood, anxiety, psychotic disorders and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The association remained, even after adjusting for important variables including parental psychiatric disorder. In contrast, the relationship was reversed for eating disorders, for which children in higher income trajectories had elevated risks. Findings show that children growing up in a household characterised by low or decreasing family income have an increased risk for psychiatric disorder.

Environmental factors, such as material deprivation, exposure to stressful situations, violence, nutritional deprivation, environmental toxins may shape the developing brain. The changes of the structure and function of the brain since prenatal stages and their consequences can remain stable throughout the life cycle except early interventions are made. Research investigating have found significant link between child poverty and function and structural brain focusing on prefrontal cortex (i.e., executive functions), hippocampus (learning and memory), amygdala (i.e., fear and emotional processing) and Left Occipitotemporal and Perisylvian Regions (Language and Reading) In recent years, international studies show a growing population with intellectual disabilities in prisons. However, in criminal justice, people with mild intellectual disabilities suffer a normalization process. A lack of access to adequate diagnosis operate as an omission this vulnerable group, as a result the State deprive access to support systems guaranteed in international declarations of Human Rights. Furthermore neglect, discrimination, lack of access to comprehensive health and appropriate social interventions deepen in prison. It is for this reason that from a current human rights perspective a person with disability in jail becomes a doubly vulnerable subject.","D001118; D003071; D003416; D006801; D008607; D011203","Argentina; Cognition; Criminal Law; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Poverty",NA,"NA",NA,"Ezequiel N Mercurio","Cap&#xed;tulo de Discapacidad Intelectual y del Desarrollo."

Secondary analyses of the National Survey of Children's Health for years 2003, 2007, and 2011-2012 were conducted to identify trends in parent reported lifetime prevalence and comorbidity among children with asthma, ADHD, and ASD and examine variation by sociodemographic characteristics, poverty status, and insurance coverage. Using 2011-2012 data, multivariable regression was used to examine whether poverty status predicted higher than average comorbid conditions after adjusting for other sociodemographic characteristics. Parent-reported lifetime prevalence of asthma and ADHD rose 18% and 44%, respectively, whereas the lifetime prevalence of ASD rose almost 400% (from 0.5% to 2%). For asthma, the rise was most prominent among the poor at 25.8%. For ADHD, the percent change by poverty status was similar (&lt;100% federal poverty level [FPL]: 43.20%, 100% to 199% FPL: 52.38%, 200% to 399% FPL: 43.67%), although rise in ASD was associated with being nonpoor (200% to 399% FPL: 43.6%, &#x2265;400% FPL: 36.0%). Publicly insured children with asthma, ADHD, and ASD also had significantly higher odds (1.9&#xd7;, 1.6&#xd7;, 3.0&#xd7;, respectively) of having higher than average comorbidities. Poverty status differentially influenced parent-reported lifetime prevalence and comorbidities of these target disorders. Future research is needed to examine parent and system-level characteristics that may further explain poverty's variable impact.","D000293; D001007; D001249; D001289; D000067877; D002648; D002675; D015897; D019955; D003863; D002658; D005260; D006306; D006801; D007223; D007231; D007806; D007859; D008297; D008484; D011203; D015995; D013064; D014481","Adolescent; Anxiety; Asthma; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Child, Preschool; Comorbidity; Conduct Disorder; Depression; Developmental Disabilities; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Language Disorders; Learning Disabilities; Male; Medicaid; Poverty; Prevalence; Speech Disorders; United States",NA,"NA",NA,"Christian D Pulcini, Bonnie T Zima, Kelly J Kelleher, Amy J Houtrow","Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania;"

These skills are influenced by different individual and contextual factors at multiple levels of analysis (i.e., individual, family, social, and cultural). Available evidence suggests that the influences of those biological, psychosocial, and sociocultural factors on emotional and cognitive development can vary according to the type, number, accumulation of risks, and co-occurrence of adverse circumstances that are related to poverty, the time in which these factors exert their influences, and the individual susceptibility to them. Complementary, during the past three decades, several experimental interventions that were aimed at optimizing development of self-regulation of children who live in poverty have been designed, implemented, and evaluated. Their results suggest that it is possible to optimize different aspects of cognitive performance and that it would be possible to transfer some aspects of these gains to other cognitive domains and academic achievement. We suggest that it is an important task for ethics, notably but not exclusively neuroethics, to engage in this interdisciplinary research domain to contribute analyses of key concepts, arguments, and interpretations. The specific evidence that neuroscience brings to the analyses of poverty and its implications needs to be spelled out in detail and clarified conceptually, notably in terms of causes of and attitudes toward poverty, implications of poverty for brain development, and for the possibilities to reduce and reverse these effects.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.appdev.2015.12.005; 10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.15081014; 10.2307/1125869; 10.1126/science.1204534; 10.1186/1471-2458-13-835; 10.1038/4551057a; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2015.09.003; 10.1371/journal.pone.0112393; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01643.x; 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233; 10.1108/17466660200700003; 10.1111/1467-8624.00405; 10.2307/1602387; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2009.11.001; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.10.015; 10.1177/0963721414550704; 10.1111/mono.12271; 10.1016/j.dcn.2010.12.001; 10.1111/cdev.12391; 10.1126/science.1151148; 10.1017/S0954579413000667; 10.1002/wcs.1176; 10.1037/0894-4105.22.3.293; 10.1037/0003-066X.59.2.77; 10.1111/desc.12082; 10.15252/embr.201642783; 10.1038/nrn2649; 10.1016/j.gfs.2016.03.003; 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032814-112855; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181e1a23c; 10.1073/pnas.1320217111; 10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.003; 10.1038/nrn2897; 10.1111/desc.12246; 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.1475; 10.1371/journal.pone.0018712; 10.1371/journal.pone.0080954; 10.1126/science.1128898; 10.1038/nrn1787; 10.1016/j.tine.2015.03.003; 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2014.09.031; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.10.020; 10.1016/j.dr.2005.11.002; 10.1038/nrn2721; 10.3758/s13421-013-0364-z; 10.1371/journal.pone.0042486; 10.1542/peds.2015-3075; 10.1073/pnas.1308240110; 10.1162/jocn.2009.21101; 10.1097/00004583-200502000-00010; 10.1111/desc.12096; 10.1002/ijop.12282; 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00238; 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00053; 10.1111/desc.12080; 10.3102/0013189X032001014; 10.1016/S0893-133X(99)00129-3; 10.1038/nn.4086; 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.10.012; 10.1177/0956247806069627; 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2003.03070.x; 10.1038/nn.3862; 10.1073/pnas.1304437110; 10.1037/0012-1649.41.1.99; 10.1038/nn.3983; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2012.01147.x; 10.1111/desc.12077; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00542.x; 10.1159/000216541; 10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2014.11.005; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.04.025; 10.3389/neuro.09.003.2010; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.01.021; 10.1037/0003-066X.53.2.109; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.07.003; 10.1038/nature.2015.17227; 10.1111/cdev.12270; 10.1016/j.ynstr.2014.11.001; 10.1111/j.1741-3737.2005.00188.x; 10.1073/pnas.0506897102; 10.1146/annurev.psych.121208.131619; 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00205; 10.1016/S0006-3223(02)01836-X; 10.1371/journal.pone.0035744; 10.1542/peds.2011-2663; 10.1542/peds.2013-1632; 10.1002/ana.22631; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00807.x; 10.1073/pnas.0030098100; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00745.x; 10.1111/desc.12079; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2004.03.011; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2010.00971.x; 10.1111/psyp.12547; 10.1016/j.dcn.2013.12.002; 10.1111/cdep.12125; 10.1111/j.1751-228X.2009.01075.x; 10.1186/1744-9081-2-19; 10.1038/nn1401; 10.1037/a0028015",NA,"Sebasti&#xe1;n J Lipina, Kathinka Evers","Centre for Research Ethics and Bioethics (CRB), Uppsala Universitet Uppsala, Sweden."

This is an important research gap, given the rapid increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases associated with lifestyle changes in these countries. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the association between chronic conditions, multimorbidity and low physical activity (PA) among community-dwelling adults in 46 LMICs, and explore the mediators of these relationships. World Health Survey data included 228,024 adults aged &#x2265;18&#xa0;years from 46 LMICs. PA was assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Nine chronic physical conditions (chronic back pain, angina, arthritis, asthma, diabetes, hearing problems, tuberculosis, visual impairment and edentulism) were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analyses were used to assess the association between chronic conditions or multimorbidity and low PA. Overall, in the multivariable analysis, arthritis (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.12), asthma (1.19), diabetes (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.33), edentulism (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.46), hearing problems (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.90), tuberculosis (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.24), visual impairment (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.29), multimorbidity (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.31; 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.21-1.42) were significantly associated with low PA. More significant associations were observed in individuals aged &#x2265;50&#xa0;years. In older adults, depression mediated between 5.1% (visual impairment) to 23.5% (angina) of the association between a chronic condition and low PA. Mobility difficulties explained more than 25% of the association for seven of the eight chronic conditions. Pain was a strong mediator for angina (65.9%) and arthritis (64.9%), while sleep problems mediated up to 43.7% (angina) of the association. In LMICs, those with chronic conditions and multimorbidity are significantly less physically active (especially older adults). Research on the efficacy and effectiveness of PA in the management of chronic diseases in LMICs is urgently needed. Targeted promotion of physical activity to populations in LMICs experiencing chronic conditions may ameliorate associated depression, mobility difficulties and pain that are themselves important barriers for initiating or adopting an active lifestyle.","D000328; D000368; D000787; D001168; D002908; D015897; D003430; D003863; D003906; D003920; D015444; D005260; D014943; D006306; D006801; D007182; D008019; D016015; D008297; D008875; D051346; D010146; D011203; D015995; D012890; D055815","Adult; Aged; Angina Pectoris; Arthritis; Chronic Disease; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Developing Countries; Diabetes Mellitus; Exercise; Female; Global Health; Health Surveys; Humans; Income; Life Style; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Mobility Limitation; Pain; Poverty; Prevalence; Sleep; Young Adult",NA,"10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61340-X; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61729-2; 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.004046; 10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-204627; 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60692-4; 10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-204428; 10.1111/odi.12428; 10.1093/eurpub/ckr176; 10.4081/idr.2016.6570; 10.1016/j.ophtha.2013.05.025; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61696-1; 10.1370/afm.1337; 10.1371/journal.pone.0102149; 10.1080/13814780802436093; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60482-6; 10.1186/1477-7525-2-51; 10.1177/1077558711399580; 10.1007/s11606-015-3524-y; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60240-2; 10.1111/sms.12581; 10.1249/MSS.0b013e318206c66e; 10.1136/bjsports-2014-094306; 10.1186/1471-2458-14-1170; 10.1186/s12966-016-0330-9; 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00128-2; 10.1001/jama.2013.184182; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61240-9; 10.1007/s00038-015-0680-0; 10.1016/j.pmedr.2015.11.009; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61415-9; 10.3109/09638288.2011.587090; 10.1371/journal.pone.0063315; 10.1093/ije/dyq238; 10.1186/s12916-016-0734-z; 10.1093/schbul/sbq099; 10.1111/acps.12010; 10.1017/S0033291716001422; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.04.003; 10.1371/journal.pone.0114742; 10.1177/0049124113494572; 10.5665/sleep.5232; 10.1177/0269215514538069; 10.1186/s13075-015-0533-5; 10.1016/j.jbspin.2015.10.002; 10.1017/S0950268813002070; 10.1016/S1473-3099(16)00070-0; 10.1097/01.hjr.0000086303.28200.50; 10.1111/jgs.12938; 10.1123/apaq.2013-0039; 10.1111/j.1741-2358.2007.00196.x; 10.1186/s13033-016-0057-7; 10.1177/1359105307076232; 10.1016/j.schres.2015.02.015; 10.1016/j.jad.2013.10.051; 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2015.11.008; 10.7326/M14-1651; 10.1093/gerona/glq208",NA,"Davy Vancampfort, Ai Koyanagi, Philip B Ward, Simon Rosenbaum, Felipe B Schuch, James Mugisha, Justin Richards, Joseph Firth, Brendon Stubbs","Physiotherapy Department, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill, London, SE5 8AZ, UK."

Previous work has suggested hyperactive neural response to social fear cues, as well as impairment in neural regulatory functions. However, despite differences found between males and females in stress-related and anxiety disorders, possible sex-specific effects of poverty on emotional processing have not been explored. We analyzed data from three previously reported experiments of childhood poverty effects on emotional processing and regulation, for sex-specific effects. Participants were 52 healthy Caucasian males and females, from a longitudinal cohort of poverty development study, who were recruited for examining the long-term effects of childhood poverty and stress. The three functional MRI studies included emotion regulation task, emotional face assessment task, and shifted attention emotion appraisal task. Brain activations that associated with childhood poverty previously were entered into a regression analysis with interaction of gender by childhood income-to-need ratio as the independent variable, and age and current income-to-need ratio as variables of no interest, separately for males and females. Amygdala reactivity to implicitly processed fearful faces was positively correlated with childhood income-to-need in adult females but not males. On the other hand, activation in dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal regions during emotion regulation by reappraisal was positively correlated with childhood income-to-need in males. Childhood poverty may exert sex-specific effects in adulthood as presented by hypersensitive emotional reactivity of the amygdala in females, and impaired emotion regulatory function of the prefrontal cortex in males.

To examine the developmental pathways that lead to first-episode adolescent-onset MDD (incident cases) in those at high familial risk and to postulate a theoretically informed model that enables simultaneous testing of different pathways to incident adolescent-onset MDD composed of contributions from familial/genetic and social risk factors, as well as effects via specific clinical antecedents. This investigation was a 4-year longitudinal study (April 2007 to March 2011) among offspring of depressed parents in the general community. Analyses were conducted between September 1, 2015, and May 27, 2016. Participants were 337 families in whom the index parent (315 mothers and 22 fathers) had experienced at least 2 episodes of MDD (recruited through primary care) and among whom there was a biologically related child in the age range of 9 to 17 years living with the index parent (197 girls and 140 boys with a mean [SD] age of 12.4 [2.0] years) at baseline. Offspring with MDD before the study or at baseline (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;27), offspring with an episode of MDD that had remitted by follow-up (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4), and offspring with missing baseline MDD data (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2) were excluded. Ninety-two percent (279 of 304) of families completed the follow-up. The primary outcome was new-onset offspring MDD, and the secondary outcome was the total DSM-IV MDD symptom score. On average, children and adolescents had a mean (SD) of 1.85 (1.74) (range, 0-8.5) DSM-IV symptoms of MDD at follow-up. Twenty (6 males and 14 females) had new-onset MDD, with a mean (SD) age at onset of 14.4 (2.0) years (range, 10-18 years). Irritability (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.12, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.03) and fear and/or anxiety (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.38, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) were significant independent clinical antecedents of new adolescent-onset MDD, but disruptive behavior (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.08, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.14) and low mood (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.03, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.65) were not. The results were similar for the DSM-IV symptom count at follow-up. All the measured familial/genetic and social risk indicators directly influenced risk for new-onset MDD rather than indirectly through acting on dimensional clinical antecedents. There are multiple pathways to first-onset adolescent depression in individuals at familial risk. Irritability and fear/anxiety may be additional clinical phenomena to be included as targets in primary preventive interventions focusing on the child. In addition to targeting these phenomena in parents and children, depression prevention methods in high-risk groups may need to take into consideration social risks, such as poverty and psychosocial adversity.","D000293; D002648; D003865; D039721; D005260; D020022; D006801; D008137; D008297; D011203; D011446; D011610; D012306","Adolescent; Child; Depressive Disorder, Major; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Poverty; Prospective Studies; Psychosocial Deprivation; Risk","MR/L010305/1","NA",NA,"Frances Rice, Ruth Sellers, Gemma Hammerton, Olga Eyre, Rhys Bevan-Jones, Ajay K Thapar, Stephan Collishaw, Gordon T Harold, Anita Thapar","Medical Research Council Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, Wales."

However, little is known about physical health multimorbidity in this population or in people with subclinical psychosis and in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study explores physical health multimorbidity patterns among people with psychosis or subclinical psychosis. Overall, data from 242,952 individuals from 48 LMICs, recruited via the World Health Survey, were included in this cross-sectional study. Participants were subdivided into those (1) with a lifetime diagnosis of psychosis (""psychosis""); (2) with more than one psychotic symptom in the past 12&#xa0;months, but no lifetime diagnosis of psychosis (""subclinical psychosis""); and (3) without psychotic symptoms in the past 12&#xa0;months or a lifetime diagnosis of psychosis (""controls""). Nine operationalized somatic disorders were examined: arthritis, angina pectoris, asthma, diabetes, chronic back pain, visual impairment, hearing problems, edentulism, and tuberculosis. The association between psychosis and multimorbidity was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of multimorbidity (i.e., two or more physical health conditions) was: controls&#x2009;=&#x2009;11.4% (95% CI, 11.0-11.8%); subclinical psychosis&#x2009;=&#x2009;21.8% (95% CI, 20.6-23.0%), and psychosis&#x2009;=&#x2009;36.0% (95% CI, 32.1-40.2%) (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). After adjustment for age, sex, education, country-wise wealth, and country, subclinical psychosis and psychosis were associated with 2.20 (95% CI, 2.02-2.39) and 4.05 (95% CI, 3.25-5.04) times higher odds for multimorbidity. Moreover, multimorbidity was increased in subclinical and established psychosis in all age ranges (18-44, 45-64, &#x2265; 65&#xa0;years). However, multimorbidity was most evident in younger age groups, with people aged 18-44 years with psychosis at greatest odds of physical health multimorbidity (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.68; 95% CI, 3.46-6.32). This large multinational study demonstrates that physical health multimorbidity is increased across the psychosis-spectrum. Most notably, the association between multimorbidity and psychosis was stronger among younger adults, thus adding further impetus to the calls for the early intervention efforts to prevent the burden of physical health comorbidity at later stages. Urgent public health interventions are necessary not only for those with a psychosis diagnosis, but also for subclinical psychosis to address this considerable public health problem.","D000293; D000328; D000368; D002318; D002908; D015897; D003430; D005260; D014943; D006306; D006801; D038622; D008297; D008659; D008875; D011203; D015995; D025341; D011618; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Chronic Disease; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Global Health; Health Surveys; Humans; Internationality; Male; Metabolic Diseases; Middle Aged; Poverty; Prevalence; Principal Component Analysis; Psychotic Disorders; Young Adult",NA,"10.1136/bmj.f2539; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2014.2502; 10.1186/1471-244X-10-77; 10.1017/S0033291715000562; 10.1002/wps.20252; 10.1002/wps.20309; 10.1002/wps.20204; 10.1371/journal.pone.0082606; 10.1002/wps.20130; 10.1016/j.schres.2014.10.017; 10.1016/j.psychres.2015.10.008; 10.1186/s12955-015-0355-9; 10.1186/1477-7525-2-51; 10.1007/s11606-015-3524-y; 10.1001/jama.2015.7008; 10.1177/1077558711399580; 10.1002/wps.20070; 10.1371/journal.pone.0018566; 10.1016/j.schres.2016.04.031; 10.1192/bjp.bp.113.143198; 10.1017/S2045796016000056; 10.1111/acps.12431; 10.1093/gerona/glv128; 10.1097/JCP.0000000000000166; 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60733-3; 10.1038/npp.2010.78; 10.1038/nrendo.2011.156; 10.1111/acps.12566; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61415-9; 10.1093/schbul/sbq099; 10.1371/journal.pone.0063315; 10.1093/ije/dyq238; 10.1002/mpr.168; 10.1016/S0022-3956(98)00021-1; 10.1371/journal.pone.0048834; 10.1017/S0033291716001422; 10.1002/j.2051-5545.2011.tb00014.x; 10.1002/j.2051-5545.2011.tb00036.x; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02235.x; 10.1002/da.22387; 10.1111/acps.12412; 10.1155/2014/791573; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2012.10.005; 10.1016/j.psychres.2016.04.045; 10.1111/j.1532-849X.2009.00437.x; 10.1590/S0036-36342006000700024; 10.1002/ppul.23037; 10.1016/j.schres.2010.12.012; 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.3432; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60240-2; 10.1371/journal.pone.0152866; 10.1136/bmj.e6202; 10.1186/1471-2458-14-575; 10.1186/s13033-016-0057-7; 10.1111/acps.12466; 10.1192/bjp.bp.107.045732; 10.1177/1359786810382056; 10.1192/bjp.bp.109.076950; 10.1192/bjp.bp.111.094532; 10.1192/bjp.bp.114.147629; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2008.01241.x",NA,"Brendon Stubbs, Ai Koyanagi, Nicola Veronese, Davy Vancampfort, Marco Solmi, Fiona Gaughran, Andr&#xe9; F Carvalho, John Lally, Alex J Mitchell,  ..., Christoph U Correll","The Zucker Hillside Hospital, Psychiatry Research, Northwell Health, Glen Oaks, New York, USA."

Exploring new food items with improved dietary nutrition factors may, therefore, help to decrease the mortality rate in the poor countries like Bangladesh. Accordingly, the present study was a proximate composition and fatty acid analysis of <i>L. purpureus</i> seed-a legume seed which is given no careful attention locally, though it might be a good source of valuable nutrition factors for both animals and humans. The purpose of the study was, therefore, to generate awareness that <i>L. purpureus</i> could also act as a good source of food components essential for good health. Proximate analysis revealed that the seed powder contained 8.47&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.52% moisture; 3.50&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.0.07% ash; 1.02&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.06% total fat; 23.95&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.15% total protein; 1.21&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.16% total dietary fiber; 61.86&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.70% total carbohydrate and 352.4&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.66&#xa0;kcal/100&#xa0;g energy.

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, ScieELO, Google Scholar and Cochrane databases for studies reporting evidence, experience or evaluation of capacity-building of policy-makers, service planners or managers in mental health system strengthening in LMICs. Reports in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French or German were included. Additional papers were identified by hand-searching references and contacting experts and key informants. Database searches yielded 2922 abstracts and 28 additional papers were identified. Following screening, 409 full papers were reviewed, of which 14 fulfilled inclusion criteria for the review. Data were extracted from all included papers and synthesized into a narrative review. Only a small number of mental health system-related capacity-building interventions for policy-makers and planners in LMICs were described. Most models of capacity-building combined brief training with longer term mentorship, dialogue and/or the establishment of networks of support. However, rigorous research and evaluation methods were largely absent, with studies being of low quality, limiting the potential to separate mental health system strengthening outcomes from the effects of associated contextual factors. This review demonstrates the need for partnership approaches to building the capacity of mental health policy-makers and planners in LMICs, assessed rigorously against pre-specified conceptual frameworks and hypotheses, utilising longitudinal evaluation and mixed quantitative and qualitative approaches.","D000288; D057191; D003906; D006078; D006291; D006302; D006801; D007400; D008483; D008605; D011203; D011787","Administrative Personnel; Capacity Building; Developing Countries; Government Programs; Health Policy; Health Services Research; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Medical Assistance; Mental Health Services; Poverty; Quality of Health Care",NA,"10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61611-6; 10.1192/bjp.bp.114.149112; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61238-0; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61458-X; 10.1093/schbul/sbn029; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61241-0; 10.1093/heapol/czv032; 10.1093/heapol/czp027; 10.1093/heapol/czq078; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61263-X; 10.1097/YCO.0b013e3283477afb; 10.1093/heapol/czs090; 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60679-4; 10.1186/s12913-016-1323-8; 10.1111/j.1524-475X.2004.04006.x; 10.1136/bmj.320.7226.50; 10.1016/S0955-3959(00)00065-7; 10.2471/BLT.12.108274; 10.1002/j.2051-5545.2010.tb00289.x; 10.1186/1752-4458-4-19; 10.1176/ps.2010.61.10.1028; 10.1002/imhj.21433; 10.5042/ijlps.2010.0575; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61093-3; 10.3109/10673229.2012.649090; 10.1186/1752-4458-8-5; 10.1177/1757975913500682; 10.1186/1752-4458-4-17; 10.1080/09540260600655755; 10.3109/10398562.2011.583067; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001225; 10.1186/1752-4458-5-6; 10.1590/S1020-49892005000900012; 10.1176/ps.2010.61.3.218; 10.2307/3342608; 10.1093/heapol/czr006; 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16987-0; 10.1186/1478-4491-8-5; 10.1186/1478-4491-10-33",NA,"Roxanne Keynejad, Maya Semrau, Mark Toynbee, Sara Evans-Lacko, Crick Lund, Oye Gureje, Sheila Ndyanabangi, Emilie Courtin, Jibril O Abdulmalik,  ..., Charlotte Hanlon","Addis Ababa University, College of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry &amp; Centre for Global Mental Health, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, 16 De Crespigny Park, London, SE5 8AF, UK."

In this review we highlight difficulties inherent in the frequent use of reverse inference to interpret SES-related abnormalities in brain regions that support language. While there is growing evidence suggesting that SES moderates children's developing brain structure and function, no studies to date have elucidated explicitly how these neural findings are related to variations in children's language abilities, or precisely what it is about SES that underlies or contributes to these differences. This issue is complicated by the fact that SES is confounded with such linguistic factors as cultural language use, first language, and bilingualism. Thus, SES-associated differences in brain regions that support language may not necessarily indicate differences in neurocognitive abilities. In this review we consider the multidimensionality of SES, discuss studies that have found SES-related differences in structure and function in brain regions that support language, and suggest future directions for studies in the area of cognitive neuroscience of SES that are less reliant on reverse inference.","D001076; D001921; D002648; D002657; D002675; D003467; D005260; D006801; D007802; D007804; D008297; D019303; D059906; D012923","Aptitude; Brain; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Cultural Deprivation; Female; Humans; Language; Language Development; Male; Multilingualism; Neuroimaging; Social Class","R01 MH101495","NA",NA,"Monica E Ellwood-Lowe, Matthew D Sacchet, Ian H Gotlib","Department of Psychology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Neurosciences Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."

The biopsychosocial model of depression and prevailing socioeconomic hardships for older people in LMICs have provided the impetus to determine the prevalence of geriatric depression; to study its associations with health, social, and economic variables; and to investigate socioeconomic inequalities in depression prevalence in LMICs. The authors accessed the World Health Organization Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health Wave 1 data that studied nationally representative samples from six large LMICs (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;14,877). A computerized algorithm derived depression diagnoses. The authors assessed hypothesized associations using survey multivariate logistic regression models for each LMIC and pooled their risk estimates by meta-analyses and investigated related socioeconomic inequalities using concentration indices. Cross-national prevalence of geriatric depression was 4.7% (95% CI: 1.9%-11.9%). Female gender, illiteracy, poverty, indebtedness, past informal-sector occupation, bereavement, angina, and stroke had significant positive associations, whereas pension support and health insurance showed significant negative associations with geriatric depression. Pro-poor inequality of geriatric depression were documented in five LMICs. Socioeconomic factors and related inequalities may predispose, precipitate, or perpetuate depression amongolder people in LMICs. Relative absence of health safety net places socioeconomically disadvantaged older people in LMICs at risk.

In Nepal the use of open stoves with solid biomass fuels is the primary method of domestic cooking. To assess patterns of domestic air pollution we performed continuous measurement of carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate Matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) in 12 biomass fuel households in Janakpur, Nepal. We measured kitchen PM<sub>2.5</sub> and CO concentrations at one-minute intervals for an approximately 48-h period using the TSI DustTrak II 8530/SidePak AM510 (TSI Inc, St. Paul MN, USA) or EL-USB-CO data logger (Lascar Electronics, Erie PA, USA) respectively. We also obtained information regarding fuel, stove and kitchen characteristics and cooking activity patterns. Household cooking was performed in two daily sessions (median total duration 4&#xa0;h) with diurnal variability in pollutant concentrations reflecting morning and evening cooking sessions and peak concentrations associated with fire-lighting. We observed a strong linear relationship between PM<sub>2.5</sub> measurements obtained by co-located photometric and gravimetric monitoring devices, providing local calibration factors of 4.9 (DustTrak) and 2.7 (SidePak).

Many of the questions in these scales are culture-bound, fail to capture differentiation of tasks by gender and are difficult to adapt to other contexts. The aim of this study was to develop a measure of functioning for people with SMD which is contextually appropriate for a rural African setting. A review of existing scales, a qualitative study, free listing and pile sorting exercises, and expert consensus were used to establish a pool of items. Cognitive interviewing guided initial item reduction and refinement. The resulting scale was pilot-tested in people with SMD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;200) and their caregivers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;200) to inform further item reduction based on psychometric properties. The final Butajira Functioning Scale (BFS) comprised 33 items that were common to both men and women, and an additional eight items for women only, covering the following domains: self-care, work, and family and community participation. Psychometric properties of the finalized BFS were examined in a facility-based sample of 150 people with SMD and their caregivers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;150), with longitudinal follow-up of n&#x2009;=&#x2009;84. The BFS in people with SMD had excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's &#x3b1;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.99), acceptable convergent validity (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.88 with the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule [WHODAS-2.0] and r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.32 with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS-E]) and was sensitive to change following treatment (effect size =0.50). Addition of the items specific to women did not improve the psychometric properties. The caregiver version had similar psychometric properties but higher mean values for each item and better responsiveness to change. Exploratory factor analysis of the BFS provided evidence of construct validity, with four underlying dimensions. We have developed a measure of functioning for people with SMD in a rural, low income country setting with acceptable psychometric properties. The BFS is easy to administer, sensitive to changes following treatment and has content, construct and convergent validity. The BFS includes domains from existing measures, but has more emphasis on social and occupational domains, which reflects priorities in the setting.","D000328; D000349; D010054; D004185; D005163; D005260; D005500; D006801; D008137; D008297; D001523; D010865; D011203; D011594; D036301; D015203; D012424","Adult; Africa; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; Disability Evaluation; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mental Disorders; Pilot Projects; Poverty; Psychometrics; Qualitative Research; Reproducibility of Results; Rural Population","U19 MH095699","10.1111/j.1399-5618.2007.00327.x; 10.1186/1745-0179-3-5; 10.1046/j.1440-1614.2001.00846.x; 10.1186/s12888-015-0418-9; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2007.01108.x; 10.1177/1363461504043565; 10.1007/s00127-004-0763-3; 10.1097/00005053-200209000-00009; 10.1007/s00127-002-0580-5; 10.1590/S1516-44462006000200014; 10.4314/ajpsy.v12i3.48494; 10.3329/icpj.v1i4.10063; 10.1192/bjp.191.50.s71; 10.1016/S0920-9964(00)90482-1; 10.1186/1471-2458-10-390; 10.1017/S1121189X00001305; 10.1016/j.joca.2007.12.015; 10.3758/BRM.41.4.1149; 10.3758/BF03193146; 10.1007/s11136-014-0624-9; 10.2471/BLT.09.067231; 10.1186/s12963-014-0027-8; 10.1186/1477-7525-8-51; 10.1038/ejhg.2013.275; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002716; 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2012.04126.x; 10.1192/bjp.bp.105.019489; 10.1177/1363461508100783; 10.1016/S0895-4356(99)00206-1; 10.1192/bjp.157.6.853; 10.1097/00005650-199804000-00012; 10.1007/s11136-012-0212-9; 10.1016/j.ramb.2012.11.005; 10.1016/j.schres.2005.05.028; 10.1016/j.jad.2005.11.009; 10.1192/bjp.bp.105.013417; 10.1093/schbul/sbl035; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2006.08.003; 10.1176/ajp.2007.164.3.428",NA,"Kassahun Habtamu, Atalay Alem, Girmay Medhin, Abebaw Fekadu, Martin Prince, Charlotte Hanlon","Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, P.O.BOX: 1176, Ethiopia."

Thus, an important goal for society should be to improve math readiness in preschool-age children, especially in low-income children who typically arrive in kindergarten with less mathematical competency than their higher income peers. The majority of existing research-based math intervention programs target symbolic verbal number concepts in young children. However, very little attention has been paid to the preverbal intuitive ability to approximately represent numerical quantity, which is hypothesized to be an important foundation for full-fledged mathematical thinking. Here, we tested the hypothesis that repeated engagement of non-symbolic approximate addition and subtraction of large arrays of items results in improved math skills in very young children, an idea that stems from our previous studies in adults. In the current study, 3- to 5-year-olds showed selective improvements in math skills after multiple days of playing a tablet-based non-symbolic approximate arithmetic game compared with children who played a memory game. These findings, collectively with our previous reports, suggest that mental manipulation of approximate numerosities provides an important tool for improving math readiness, even in preschoolers who have yet to master the meaning of number words.","D000073978; D001288; D002675; D005260; D006801; D007182; D008297; D008433; D008570; D011203; D012574; D013561; D013850","Academic Performance; Attention; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Income; Male; Mathematics; Memory, Short-Term; Poverty; Schools; Symbolism; Thinking","R01 HD079106","10.1007/BF03217428; 10.1177/0956797614547539; 10.1080/10409280802206619; 10.1177/1745691613491271; 10.2307/30035522; 10.2307/30034954; 10.1126/science.1204537; 10.1111/bjdp.12118; 10.1037/0012-1649.43.6.1428; 10.1177/0022219411410233; 10.1037/0022-0063.97.3.493; 10.1111/desc.12013; 10.1016/0010-0277(92)90050-R; 10.1371/journal.pone.0054651; 10.1016/0010-0277(94)90068-X; 10.1016/j.cognition.2010.02.002; 10.1177/0956797613516471; 10.1126/science.1094492; 10.1037/a0012682; 10.1073/pnas.1200196109; 10.1038/nature07246; 10.1016/j.cognition.2013.12.007; 10.3758/s13423-011-0154-1; 10.1073/pnas.0812142106; 10.1016/j.lindif.2009.07.004; 10.1111/j.1540-5826.2007.00229.x; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2006.00862.x; 10.1037/a0014939; 10.1037/0012-1649.42.1.59; 10.1016/j.learninstruc.2012.12.001; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2011.01080.x; 10.1016/j.cognition.2016.01.005; 10.1016/j.cognition.2011.07.009; 10.1016/j.lindif.2014.05.006; 10.1371/journal.pone.0023749; 10.1177/0956797613482944; 10.1016/j.cognition.2014.06.011; 10.1016/j.cognition.2016.02.012; 10.1177/0956797612464057; 10.1126/science.1102085; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01131.x; 10.1016/j.jecp.2012.10.012; 10.1037/a0014239; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2004.01.002; 10.1016/j.visres.2013.06.006; 10.1111/j.2044-8279.2011.02049.x; 10.1016/S0010-0277(99)00066-9; 10.1016/S0885-2014(96)90027-1",NA,"Joonkoo Park, Vanessa Bermudez, Rachel C Roberts, Elizabeth M Brannon","Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."

Fifty six patients aged between 15 and 45years with FEP and forty five control subjects were included in the study. All the patients were under medication for less than six weeks or drug-naive. FTD was assessed using the Thought and Language Index (TLI), which is composed of impoverishment of thought and disorganization of thought subscales. FEP patients showed significantly higher scores on the items of poverty of speech, weakening of goal, perseveration, looseness, peculiar word use, peculiar sentence construction and peculiar logic compared to controls. Poverty of speech, perseveration and peculiar word use were the significant factors differentiating FEP patients from controls when controlling for years of education, family history of psychosis and drug abuse.","D000293; D000328; D005260; D006801; D008297; D008875; D019965; D009483; D011618; D013850; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neurocognitive Disorders; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychotic Disorders; Thinking; Young Adult",NA,"NA",NA,"Ahmet Ayer, Berna Yal&#x131;n&#xe7;etin, Esra Ayd&#x131;nl&#x131;, &#x15e;ilay Sevilmi&#x15f;, Halis Ula&#x15f;, Tolga Binbay, Berna Binnur Akdede, K&#xf6;ksal Alptekin","Department of Neuroscience, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey; Department of Psychiatry, Medical School of Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey."

To determine how much CHWs would need to reduce emergency department (ED) visits and associated hospitalizations among their assigned patients to be cost-neutral from a payer's perspective. Using a microsimulation of patient health care utilization, costs, and revenues, we estimated what portion of ED visits and hospitalizations for different conditions would need to be prevented by a CHW program to fully pay for the program's expenses. The model simulated CHW programs enrolling patients with a history of at least 1 ED visit for a chronic condition in the prior year, utilizing data on utilization and cost from national sources. CHWs assigned to patients with uncontrolled hypertension and congestive heart failure, as compared with other common conditions, achieve cost-neutrality with the lowest number of averted visits to the ED. To achieve cost-neutrality, 4-5 visits to the ED would need to be averted per year by a CHW assigned a panel of 70 patients with uncontrolled hypertension or congestive heart failure-approximately 3%-4% of typical ED visits among such patients, respectively. Most other chronic conditions would require between 7% and 12% of ED visits to be averted to achieve cost-savings. Offsetting costs of a CHW program is theoretically feasible for many common conditions. Yet the benchmark for reducing ED visits and associated hospitalizations varies substantially by a patient's primary diagnosis.","D000293; D000328; D000368; D000369; D019985; D002908; D003150; D003362; D004636; D005260; D006296; D006760; D006801; D008297; D008875; D017059; D011320; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Benchmarking; Chronic Disease; Community Health Workers; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Health Services; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Econometric; Primary Health Care; Young Adult",NA,"NA",NA,"Sanjay Basu, Helen E Jack, Sophia D Arabadjis, Russell S Phillips","*Centers for Health Policy, Primary Care and Outcomes Research &#x2020;Prevention Research Center &#x2021;Center on Poverty and Inequality, Stanford University, Stanford, CA &#xa7;Center for Primary Care, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA &#x2225;Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK &#xb6;Division of General Medicine and Primary Care, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA."

Primary care-based mental healthcare was considered as a positive development, and would increase availability, accessibility and affordability of treatments. Low levels of community awareness, and general preference for traditional and religious healing were raised as potential challenges to the acceptability of integrated mental healthcare. Participants believed integrated mental healthcare would be comprehensive and of satisfactory quality. However, expectations about the effectiveness of treatment for mental disorders were generally low. Threats to equitable access to mental healthcare were identified for perinatal women, persons with physical disability, those living in extreme poverty and people with severe and persistent mental disability. Establishing an affordable service within reach, raising awareness and financial support to families from low socioeconomic backgrounds were suggested to improve equitable access to mental healthcare by vulnerable groups including perinatal women and people with disabilities.

This study aims to explore the barriers and facilitators, as well as perceptions about the feasibility and acceptability of plans to deliver perinatal mental health care in primary care settings in a low income, rural district in Uganda. Six focus group discussions comprising separate groups of pregnant and postpartum women and village health teams as well as eight key informant interviews were conducted in the local language using a topic guide. Transcribed data were translated into English, analyzed, and coded. Key themes were identified using a thematic analysis approach. Participants perceived that there was an important unmet need for perinatal mental health care in the district. There was evidence of significant gaps in knowledge about mental health problems as well as negative attitudes amongst mothers and health care providers towards sufferers. Poverty and inability to afford transport to services, poor partner support and stigma were thought to add to the difficulties of perinatal women accessing care. There was an awareness of the need for interventions to respond to this neglected public health problem and a willingness of both community- and facility-based health care providers to provide care for mothers with mental health problems if equipped to do so by adequate training. This study highlights the acceptability and relevance of perinatal mental health care in a rural, low-income country community. It also underscores some of the key barriers and potential facilitators to delivery of such care in primary care settings. The results of this study have implications for mental health service planning and development for perinatal populations in Uganda and will be useful in informing the development of integrated maternal mental health care in this rural district and in similar settings in other low and middle income countries.","D000293; D000328; D001291; D003906; D005260; D017144; D007722; D006297; D006801; D008297; D008427; D001523; D008603; D008605; D008875; D009035; D011247; D011248; D036301; D012424; D057545; D014454; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Developing Countries; Female; Focus Groups; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Male; Maternal Health Services; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Middle Aged; Mothers; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Qualitative Research; Rural Population; Social Stigma; Uganda; Young Adult",NA,"10.1016/S0140-6736(14)62040-7; 10.2471/BLT.11.091850; 10.1002/da.20221; 10.1192/bjp.163.5.645; 10.1001/jama.295.12.1376; 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2005.11.002; 10.1097/00131746-200509000-00009; 10.1136/jech.2005.039370; 10.1192/bjp.bp.105.012096; 10.1136/bmj.328.7443.820; 10.1080/03014460802043624; 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61277-0; 10.2471/BLT.11.088187; 10.1002/j.2051-5545.2011.tb00023.x; 10.1371/journal.pone.0088437; 10.1186/s12913-016-1291-z; 10.1017/S0033291713001943; 10.1001/jama.291.21.2581; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001359; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.07.043; 10.1007/s00737-010-0149-3; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60754-X; 10.1016/j.midw.2011.05.001; 10.3109/09540261.2010.536148; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001222; 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61508-5; 10.1111/j.1752-0606.2009.00112.x; 10.1192/bjp.134.4.401; 10.1503/cmaj.070281",NA,"Juliet E M Nakku, Elialilia S Okello, Dorothy Kizza, Simone Honikman, Joshua Ssebunnya, Sheila Ndyanabangi, Charlotte Hanlon, Fred Kigozi","Butabika Hospital, Makerere University, P.O.Box 24136, Kampala, Uganda."

Despite the high prevalence and cost of mental health disorders, an estimated 75&#xa0;% of those with need in lower resource settings do not receive intervention. Most studies to date have examined the effectiveness of single-disorder mental health treatments - an approach that may be a significant challenge to scale-up and sustainability in lower resource settings. This paper presents a brief overview of the scientific progress in global mental health, and suggests consideration of an internal stepped care delivery approach. An internal stepped care model is one idea of a delivery system, utilizing a common elements approach, where the same provider could navigate between different elements based on severity and type of problems of the client. It is distinct from traditional stepped care models in that clients remain with the same provider, rather than relying on referral systems. An internal stepped care delivery system based on a simplified common elements approach could be more efficient, scalable, sustainable, and reduce the loss of clients to referrals in lower resource settings.","D003695; D014943; D006801; D007182; D001523; D008603; D008605; D011203","Delivery of Health Care; Global Health; Humans; Income; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Poverty",NA,"10.1038/475027a; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61239-2; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61414-7; 10.1093/heapol/czl003; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60368-7; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61263-X; 10.1097/WTF.0000000000000070; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61385-8; 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61508-5; 10.1001/jama.289.23.3117; 10.1001/jama.298.5.519; 10.1056/NEJMoa1211853; 10.1037/0022-006X.76.4.686; 10.1159/000327253; 10.1001/jama.2011.1060; 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61400-2; 10.1016/j.brat.2011.06.012; 10.1016/j.chc.2008.03.002; 10.1186/1752-4458-7-24; 10.1097/WTF.0000000000000065; 10.3109/09540261.2014.966067; 10.1192/bjp.bp.109.065565; 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61093-3; 10.1016/j.healthpol.2009.09.009; 10.1016/j.cbpra.2013.06.005; 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62382-X; 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032814-112820; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.07.057; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.06.004; 10.1007/s11020-005-1962-6; 10.1016/j.brat.2009.07.005; 10.1891/0889-8391.23.1.6; 10.1016/j.beth.2012.01.001; 10.1016/j.brat.2015.04.010; 10.1002/da.21974; 10.1002/da.22018; 10.1016/j.janxdis.2015.09.003; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.147; 10.1037/a0014565; 10.1186/s12888-015-0622-7; 10.1192/bjp.186.1.11; 10.1016/j.brat.2015.03.009",NA,"L K Murray, M J D Jordans","Center for Global Mental Health; Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, 16 De Crespigny Park, London SE5 8AF, London, UK."

To test the effectiveness of prenatal docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on birth outcomes and infant development in a sample of African American women with Medicaid insurance and living in the city of Pittsburgh. The Nutrition and Pregnancy Study (NAPS) is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of prenatal DHA supplementation conducted between 2012 and 2014. Participants were recruited from obstetric clinics at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Sixty-four pregnant, African American women were enrolled at 16-21 weeks of gestation and randomized to either 450mg/day of DHA (22:6n-3)(n=43) or a soybean placebo (n=21). Four women (6.3%) withdrew from the study: two participants from each study arm; complete data were obtained for 49 infants (76.5%) at the 3-month assessment. Supplementation with DHA or placebo continued from the beginning of enrollment through delivery. Data on birth outcomes were collected from medical records. At approximately 3 months post-partum, mothers brought their infants to the laboratory where the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) were administered and cortisol response to the Face-to-Face Still-Face (FFSF) paradigm was assessed. Infants of mothers who received DHA supplementation had higher birth weight (3.174g versus 2.890g) than infants of mothers receiving placebo (F [2.40]=6.09, p=0.018, eta=0.36), and were more likely to have a 1-min Apgar score greater than 8 (OR=5.99 [95% CI=1.25-28.75], p=0.025). Infants of mothers who received DHA compared with infants of mothers receiving placebo had lower levels of cortisol in response to the FFSF paradigm (F [1.32]=5.36, p=0.018, eta=0.36). None of the scores on the BSID-III differed as a function of active supplement versus placebo. Infants of women living in urban, low-income environments who received DHA supplementation had more optimal birth outcomes and more modulated cortisol response to a stressor. DHA supplementation may be effective in attenuating the negative effects of prenatal stress on offspring development.","D000328; D001741; D001724; D002657; D019587; D004281; D004311; D005260; D006801; D007223; D009035; D011203; D011247; D011297; D039401; D055815","Adult; Black or African American; Birth Weight; Child Development; Dietary Supplements; Docosahexaenoic Acids; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Infant; Mothers; Poverty; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Prenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Young Adult","R01 HD084586; R21 HD058269; UL1 TR000430","NA","<b>Conflict of Interest</b>.

The program included children when it began in the early 1970s. The numbers of children receiving SSI benefits increased substantially in the early 1990s, in part through an expansion of the listings of mental health conditions with which children could become eligible. Over the past 20 years, larger numbers of children have received SSI benefits for mental disorders, and these increases have led to questions from the press and Congress regarding these numbers. Do they indicate more of an increase in mental disorders among SSI children than in the general population? The National Academy of Medicine (NAM; formerly the Institute of Medicine) convened a study panel to examine what is known about mental disorders among the child SSI population and how that compares with evidence about mental disorders in children in general. The NAM report provides detailed information about how SSI works, about the changing numbers of children receiving SSI for mental disorders, and some comparisons with other evidence about rising rates of mental disorders in the general population and especially among children living in poverty. The report indicates that increasing numbers of children with mental disorders in SSI mirror similar increases in the population in general.

However, behavioral studies demonstrate that poor people with high self-esteem are often exempt from the deleterious effect of poverty and instead possess a happy and successful life. Here we investigated whether high self-esteem can buffer against the deleterious effects of poverty, as indicated by low subjective socioeconomic status (SSS), on the hippocampal gray matter volume (GMV) in a large cohort of young participants (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;280). As expected, findings revealed that although low (vs. high) SSS was linked with a smaller hippocampal GMV, the deleterious effect of low SSS on hippocampal GMV was alleviated when the participants have high self-esteem. Commonality analyses further confirmed this observation.

New psychological interventions delivered by non-specialists are needed to fill the treatment gap. This paper describes the process of developing a manual based task sharing counselling intervention for perinatal depression in Khayelitsha, Cape Town. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 participants, including service providers and service users at a clinic in Khayelitsha in order to explore the feasibility, acceptability and content of a task sharing counselling intervention. The interviews were recorded, translated and transcribed. Themes were identified using the framework analysis approach and were coded and analysed using NVivo v10. After the semi-structured interviews, a workshop was conducted with mental health experts on evidence-based psychological interventions for depression, together with a document review of counselling manuals for community health workers in South Africa. The findings indicate that a task sharing counselling intervention was acceptable and feasible for depressed women in Khayelitsha, under the following conditions: (1) respondents preferred a female counsellor and felt that clinic based individual sessions should be provided at least once a month by an experienced Xhosa speaking counsellor from the community; and (2) the content of a counselling intervention should include psycho-education on cognitive and behavioural effects of depression, how to cope with interpersonal problems, and financial stressors. Based on these conditions, the review of manuals and expert consultation, key components of the counselling intervention were identified as: psycho-education, problem solving, healthy thinking and behaviour activation. These were included in the final counselling manual. The development of task sharing counselling interventions for perinatal depression should be informed by the views and needs of local service users and service providers. The study illustrates the manner in which these views can be incorporated for the development of evidence-based psychological interventions, within a task sharing framework in low and middle-income countries.","D000328; D003150; D003376; D003863; D019052; D005260; D006801; D011203; D011247; D011248; D013019","Adult; Community Health Workers; Counseling; Depression; Depression, Postpartum; Female; Humans; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; South Africa","U19 MH095699","10.1371/journal.pmed.0020291; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61689-4; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001442; 10.1177/1757913909343882; 10.1080/14767050701209560; 10.1001/archpsyc.61.9.946; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00549.x; 10.2471/BLT.11.091850; 10.1016/j.jad.2005.12.051; 10.1016/j.jad.2009.06.027; 10.1192/bjp.175.6.554; 10.1017/S0033291700001707; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.05.019; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60076-2; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.04.027; 10.1016/j.healthplace.2012.05.004; 10.1007/s00737-007-0193-9; 10.1007/s00127-008-0399-9; 10.1017/S0033291707001420; 10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2013.08.013; 10.2471/BLT.12.109819; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61238-0; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000160; 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12825-5; 10.1186/1472-6963-12-42; 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61400-2; 10.1093/heapol/czr012; 10.1001/jama.289.23.3117; 10.1186/1745-6215-15-457; 10.1080/03057070802037928; 10.1007/BF02687436; 10.1080/13552070500518186; 10.1001/jama.295.12.1376; 10.1016/j.cbpra.2006.11.004; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2005.00896.x; 10.1192/apt.bp.107.004051; 10.3109/09540261.2010.536153; 10.1080/14733140701566282; 10.1186/1748-5908-5-67",NA,"Memory Nyatsanza, Marguerite Schneider, Thandi Davies, Crick Lund","Alan J Flisher Centre for Public Mental Health, Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, University of Cape Town, 46 Sawkins Road, Rondebosch, Cape Town, South Africa."

In urban regions of LMICs, excessive salt intake is associated with increased risk of hypertension. We aimed to determine whether this is the case in rural regions as well. We performed a meta-analysis of studies in rural and urban areas of LMICs in which the association of salt and hypertension were assessed using multivariable models. We identified 18 studies with a total of 134,916 participants. The prevalence of high salt intake ranged from 21.3% to 89.5% in rural and urban populations. When salt was analysed as a continuous variable, a greater impact of salt on hypertension was found in urban (n=4) (pooled effect size (ES) 1.42, 95% CI 1.19, 1.69) than in rural populations (n=4) (pooled ES 1.07, 95% CI 1.04, 1.10, p for difference &lt;0.001). In studies where salt was analysed continuously, a greater impact of salt on hypertension was observed in lean rural populations (BMI &lt;23 kg/m2) than in non-lean rural populations (BMI &gt;=23 kg/m2, p for difference &lt;0.001). The prevalence of high salt intake is similar in rural and urban regions. Excessive salt intake has a greater impact on the prevalence of hypertension in urban than rural regions. BMI appears to modify the relationship between salt and hypertension in rural populations. &#x80cc;&#x666f;&#x4e0e;&#x76ee;&#x7684;&#xff1a;&#x5728;&#x5168;&#x7403;&#x9ad8;&#x8840;&#x538b;&#x60a3;&#x75c5;&#x7387;&#x5bf9;&#x6b7b;&#x4ea1;&#x7387;&#x8d21;&#x732e;&#x6700;&#x5927;&#xff0c;&#x5728;&#x4f4e;&#x4e2d;&#x7b49;&#x6536;&#x5165;&#x56fd;&#x5bb6;&#x9ad8;&#x8840; &#x538b;&#x7684;&#x60a3;&#x75c5;&#x7387;&#x5448;&#x589e;&#x52a0;&#x7684;&#x8d8b;&#x52bf;&#x3002;&#x5728;&#x4f4e;&#x4e2d;&#x6536;&#x5165;&#x56fd;&#x5bb6;&#x7684;&#x57ce;&#x5e02;&#xff0c;&#x8fc7;&#x91cf;&#x7684;&#x76d0;&#x6444;&#x5165;&#x4e0e;&#x9ad8;&#x8840;&#x538b;&#x60a3; &#x75c5;&#x98ce;&#x9669;&#x7684;&#x589e;&#x52a0;&#x6709;&#x5173;&#xff0c;&#x6211;&#x4eec;&#x65e8;&#x5728;&#x7814;&#x7a76;&#x519c;&#x6751;&#x5730;&#x533a;&#x662f;&#x5426;&#x4ea6;&#x5982;&#x6b64;&#x3002;&#x65b9;&#x6cd5;&#x4e0e;&#x7814;&#x7a76;&#x8bbe;&#x8ba1;&#xff1a;&#x4f7f; &#x7528;&#x591a;&#x53d8;&#x91cf;&#x6a21;&#x578b;&#xff0c;&#x6211;&#x4eec;&#x8fdb;&#x884c;&#x4e86;&#x4f4e;&#x4e2d;&#x6536;&#x5165;&#x56fd;&#x5bb6;&#x76d0;&#x4e0e;&#x9ad8;&#x8840;&#x538b;&#x5173;&#x7cfb;&#x7684;meta &#x5206;&#x6790;&#x3002;&#x7ed3;&#x679c;&#xff1a; &#x5171;&#x5206;&#x6790;&#x4e86;&#x6765;&#x81ea;18 &#x4e2a;&#x7814;&#x7a76;&#x7684;134,916 &#x540d;&#x53c2;&#x4e0e;&#x8005;&#x3002;&#x519c;&#x6751;&#x548c;&#x57ce;&#x5e02;&#x5c45;&#x6c11;&#x9ad8;&#x76d0;&#x6444;&#x5165;&#x7684;&#x6bd4;&#x4f8b; &#x5728;21.3%&#x5230;89.5%&#x4e4b;&#x95f4;&#x3002;&#x5f53;&#x76d0;&#x6444;&#x5165;&#x91cf;&#x4f5c;&#x4e3a;&#x8fde;&#x7eed;&#x578b;&#x53d8;&#x91cf;&#x5206;&#x6790;&#x65f6;&#xff0c;&#x53d1;&#x73b0;&#x57ce;&#x5e02;&#x5730;&#x533a; &#xff08;n=4&#xff09;[&#x5408;&#x5e76;&#x6548;&#x5e94;&#x5c3a;&#x5ea6;&#xff08;ES&#xff09;&#x4e3a;1.42&#xff0c;95% CI &#x4e3a;1.19-1.69]&#x6bd4;&#x519c;&#x6751;&#x5730;&#x533a; &#xff08;n=4&#xff09;[&#x5408;&#x5e76;&#x6548;&#x5e94;&#x5c3a;&#x5ea6;&#xff08;ES&#xff09;&#x4e3a;1.07&#xff0c;95% CI &#x4e3a;1.04-1.10&#xff0c;p&lt;0.001]&#x3002;&#x5f53;&#x76d0;&#x6444; &#x5165;&#x91cf;&#x4f5c;&#x4e3a;&#x8fde;&#x7eed;&#x578b;&#x53d8;&#x91cf;&#x5206;&#x6790;&#x65f6;&#xff0c;&#x4f53;&#x578b;&#x504f;&#x7626;&#x7684;&#x519c;&#x6751;&#x4eba;&#x7fa4;&#xff08;BMI &lt;23 kg/m2&#xff09;&#x6bd4;&#x4f53;&#x578b;&#x4e0d; &#x504f;&#x7626;&#x7684;&#x519c;&#x6751;&#x4eba;&#x7fa4;&#xff08;BMI &gt;=23 kg/m2&#xff0c;p&lt;0.001&#xff09;&#x76d0;&#x6444;&#x5165;&#x5bf9;&#x9ad8;&#x8840;&#x538b;&#x60a3;&#x75c5;&#x7684;&#x5f71;&#x54cd;&#x66f4; &#x5927;&#x3002;&#x7ed3;&#x8bba;&#xff1a;&#x519c;&#x6751;&#x548c;&#x57ce;&#x5e02;&#x5730;&#x533a;&#x9ad8;&#x76d0;&#x6444;&#x5165;&#x7684;&#x6bd4;&#x4f8b;&#x76f8;&#x8fd1;&#x3002;&#x4e0e;&#x519c;&#x6751;&#x5c45;&#x6c11;&#x76f8;&#x6bd4;&#xff0c;&#x57ce;&#x5e02;&#x5c45;&#x6c11; &#x8fc7;&#x591a;&#x7684;&#x76d0;&#x6444;&#x5165;&#x5bf9;&#x9ad8;&#x8840;&#x538b;&#x60a3;&#x75c5;&#x7387;&#x7684;&#x5f71;&#x54cd;&#x66f4;&#x5927;&#x3002;&#x5728;&#x519c;&#x6751;&#x5c45;&#x6c11;&#x4e2d;&#xff0c;BMI &#x80fd;&#x8c03;&#x8282;&#x76d0;&#x6444;&#x5165; &#x548c;&#x9ad8;&#x8840;&#x538b;&#x7684;&#x5173;&#x7cfb;&#x3002;.","D015984; D003906; D006801; D006973; D015994; D011203; D012307; D012424; D012959; D017673; D014505","Causality; Developing Countries; Humans; Hypertension; Incidence; Poverty; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Sodium Chloride, Dietary; Urban Population",NA,"NA",NA,"Asvini K Subasinghe, Simin Arabshahi, Doreen Busingye, Roger G Evans, Karen Z Walker, Michaela A Riddell, Amanda G Thrift","Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Sciences at Monash Health, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia."

In addition, different individual and environmental factors were identified as mediators of such influences. Such a complexity is also illustrated through the many poverty conceptual and operational definitions generated by social, human and health sciences. However, to establish the causal relationships between the different factors of poverty and neurocognitive outcomes is still an issue under construction. Most studies of this area apply classic unidimensional poverty indicators such as income and maternal education. Nonetheless, this approach does not take into adequate consideration the variability of neurocognitive outcomes depending on the type of poverty measures, and the dynamic nature of changes during development. This creates a virtual underestimation of the complexity imposed by the involved mediating mechanisms. The scientific and policy implications of this underestimation include the risk of not adequately addressing children rights and developmental opportunities. This article proposes to explore such scenario, which is necessary for the reconsideration of the criteria used to analyse the influences of poverty on child development in general and neurocognitive development in particular.","D002648; D002657; D003071; D006801; D011203; D012307","Child; Child Development; Cognition; Humans; Poverty; Risk Factors",NA,"NA",NA,"Sebasti&#xe1;n J Lipina","Unidad de Neurobiolog&#xed;a Aplicada (UNA, CEMIC-CONICET), Buenos Aires, Argentina."

The purpose of this study was to examine the stigma experiences, explanatory models, unmet needs, preferred interventions and coping mechanisms of caregivers of children with developmental disorders in Ethiopia. Participants comprised caregivers (n = 102) of children with developmental disorders attending two child mental health clinics in Addis Ababa. The majority (66.7%; n = 68) had a diagnosis of intellectual disability (ID); 34 children (33.3%) had autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as their primary diagnosis. All caregivers were administered a structured questionnaire via a face-to-face interview, which included an adaptation of the Family Interview Schedule, closed questions about socio-demographic characteristics, explanatory models of illness, type of interventions used or desired and coping strategies, and an open ended question regarding the family's unmet needs. Most caregivers reported experience of stigma: 43.1% worried about being treated differently, 45.1% felt ashamed about their child's condition and 26.7% made an effort to keep their child's condition secret. Stigma did not depend on the type of developmental disorder, the child's age or gender, or on the age or level of education of the caregiver (all p &gt; 0.05). Reported stigma was significantly higher in caregivers who had sought traditional help (p &lt; 0.01), provided supernatural explanations for their child's condition (p =&#x2009;.02) and in caregivers of Orthodox Christian faith (p =&#x2009;.03). Caregivers gave a mixture of biomedical explanations (e.g. head injury (30.4%) or birth complications (25.5%)) and supernatural explanations (e.g. spirit possession (40.2%) or sinful act (27.5%)) for their child's condition. The biggest reported unmet need was educational provision for their child (74.5%), followed by treatment by a health professional (47.1%), financial support (30.4%) and expert help to support their child's development (27.5%). Most caregivers reported that talking to health professionals (86.3%) and family (85.3%) helped them to cope. Many caregivers also used support from friends (76.5%) and prayer (57.8%) as coping mechanisms. This study highlights the stigma experienced by families caring for a child with a developmental disorder.

The study participants were attendees at a primary health care clinic in Harare, Zimbabwe. Consecutive adults aged 18 and above attending the clinic were enrolled over a two-week period in September 2013. Trained research assistants administered the screening tools to eligible participants after obtaining written consent. Participants were then interviewed by one of four psychiatrists using the Structured Clinical Interview of the DSM-IV (SCID). Performance characteristics were calculated for each tool, against the SCID as the gold standard. A total of 264 participants were enrolled, of whom 52 (20%) met the SCID criteria for depression alone, 97 (37%) for mixed depression and anxiety and 9 (3%) for anxiety alone. Of the 237 where HIV status was known, 165 (70%) were HIV positive.

Obstetric fistula is associated with high rates of stigma and psychological morbidity, but there is uncertainty about the impact of surgical treatment on psychological outcomes. The objective of this exploratory study was to examine changes in psychological symptoms following surgical fistula repair, discharge and reintegration home. Methods Women admitted for surgical repair of obstetric fistula were recruited from a Tanzanian hospital serving a rural catchment area. Psychological symptoms and social functioning were assessed prior to surgery. Approximately 3&#xa0;months after discharge, a data collector visited the patients' homes to repeat psychosocial measures and assess self-reported incontinence. Baseline to follow-up differences were measured with paired t tests controlling for multiple comparisons. Associations between psychological outcomes and leaking were assessed with t tests and Pearson correlations. Results Participants (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;28) had been living with fistula for an average of 11&#xa0;years. Baseline psychological distress was high, and decreased significantly at follow-up. Participants who self-reported continued incontinence at follow-up endorsed significantly higher PTSD and depression symptoms than those who reported being cured, and severity of leaking was associated with psychological distress. Conclusions Fistula patients experience improvements in mental health at 3&#xa0;months after discharge, but these improvements are curtailed when women experience residual leaking. Given the rate of stress incontinence following surgery, it is important to prepare fistula patients for the possibility of incomplete cure and help them develop appropriate coping strategies.","D000223; D000328; D003863; D005260; D005402; D006801; D008603; D007744; D011203; D011247; D011788; D012918; D057545; D013636","Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Depression; Female; Fistula; Humans; Mental Health; Obstetric Labor Complications; Poverty; Pregnancy; Quality of Life; Social Alienation; Social Stigma; Tanzania","R21 HD073681; R21-HD073681","10.2471/blt.13.117564; 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2012.03294.x; 10.1080/17441692.2014.903988; 10.1007/s12529-015-9466-2; 10.1258/td.2011.110423; 10.1016/S0020-7292(03)00222-4; 10.1111/tmi.12086; 10.1080/17441692.2010.551519; 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2007.01419.x; 10.1177/014662167700100306; 10.1207/s15327558ijbm0401_6; 10.1192/bjp.158.3.379; 10.1080/09540120701245999","<b>Compliance with Ethical Standards: Conflict of interest</b> The authors have no conflicts of interest to report.","Sarah M Wilson, Kathleen J Sikkema, Melissa H Watt, Gileard G Masenga, Mary V Mosha","Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre, Moshi, Tanzania."

The main objective of this study is to investigate the association between risk-behaviors and PIU in European adolescents. This cross-sectional study was conducted within the framework of the FP7 European Union project: Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE). Data on adolescents were collected from randomized schools within study sites across eleven European countries. PIU was measured using Young's Diagnostic Questionnaire (YDQ). Risk-behaviors were assessed using questions procured from the Global School-Based Student Health Survey (GSHS). A total of 11,931 adolescents were included in the analyses: 43.4% male and 56.6% female (M/F: 5179/6752), with a mean age of 14.89 &#xb1; 0.87 years. Adolescents reporting poor sleeping habits and risk-taking actions showed the strongest associations with PIU, followed by tobacco use, poor nutrition and physical inactivity. Among adolescents in the PIU group, 89.9% were characterized as having multiple risk-behaviors. The significant association observed between PIU and risk-behaviors, combined with a high rate of co-occurrence, underlines the importance of considering PIU when screening, treating or preventing high-risk behaviors among adolescents.","D000293; D000294; D016739; D003430; D005060; D005260; D006801; D020407; D008297; D012309; D013334; D011795","Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Behavior, Addictive; Cross-Sectional Studies; Europe; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Risk-Taking; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires",NA,"10.1093/scan/nsl024; 10.1016/S0193-3973(00)00063-0; 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x; 10.1016/j.appdev.2008.07.002; 10.1037/0003-066X.53.9.1017; 10.1111/1540-4560.00248; 10.1089/109493103322725441; 10.1111/nhs.12192; 10.1515/ijamh-2013-0508; 10.1016/j.adolescence.2006.07.004; 10.1080/00140130903067789; 10.2165/00023210-200822050-00001; 10.1089/cpb.1998.1.237; 10.1111/add.12162; 10.1177/0163278710380124; 10.1089/cyber.2012.0063; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2014.02.016; 10.1016/j.chc.2010.03.012; 10.1038/nrn3119; 10.1097/ADM.0b013e31825ba7e7; 10.1186/1471-2458-11-595; 10.1016/j.ejrad.2009.10.025; 10.1080/14659890500114359; 10.1089/cyber.2014.0317; 10.1007/s00038-014-0635-x; 10.1089/cyber.2013.0382; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2012.03946.x; 10.2174/13816128113199990617; 10.1159/000337971; 10.1186/1471-244X-14-183; 10.1007/s00787-014-0562-7; 10.1093/pubmed/fdr122; 10.1016/j.ypmed.2010.04.005; 10.1111/acps.12124; 10.1016/j.ypmed.2008.02.001; 10.1002/wps.20088; 10.1186/1471-2458-10-192; 10.1186/1471-2458-13-479; 10.1089/cpb.2008.0162; 10.1371/journal.pone.0145981; 10.1371/journal.pone.0110137; 10.1111/j.1440-1819.2009.01925.x; 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2007.05.004; 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2003.tb03008.x; 10.1016/j.chb.2008.11.001; 10.1016/j.chb.2005.07.002; 10.3390/ijerph8093528; 10.4103/0972-6748.119589; 10.1371/journal.pone.0117372; 10.1007/s11920-014-0444-1; 10.1016/j.sleep.2010.02.006; 10.1159/000345403; 10.1016/S0747-5632(01)00056-5; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1987.tb01490.x; 10.1007/s11469-014-9500-7; 10.1007/s11469-013-9459-9",NA,"Tony Durkee, Vladimir Carli, Birgitta Floderus, Camilla Wasserman, Marco Sarchiapone, Alan Apter, Judit A Balazs, Julio Bobes, Romuald Brunner,  ..., Danuta Wasserman","National Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention of Mental Ill-Health (NASP), Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm SE-17177, Sweden."

The review focuses on assessment approaches and information sources. A systematic review of empirical studies published in PubMed, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, LILACS, and SciELO databases between 2007 and 2015. Search terms were chosen that relate preterm birth to QoL. Twenty-two articles were included. Of these, ten investigated QoL in children, six investigated adolescents, and six investigated adults. All studies used generic instruments to assess QoL. There was a high rate of parental report to assess QoL in studies of children. Adolescent and adult studies most often assessed QoL through self-report. Parents of children who were born preterm reported worse QoL for their children compared with parents of children born full term. Teenagers and adults who were born preterm self-reported more positive outcomes in their QoL. The main risk factors associated with worse QoL in children who were born preterm were congenital malformations, mechanical ventilation during the neonatal phase, cognitive impairments, behavioral problems, physical disabilities, low family income, and black race. Agreement between parents and children about QoL in preterm individuals was lower in younger age groups compared with older age groups. The differences in QoL throughout the different age groups may have arisen because of developmental changes or differences in the source of information used (i.e., parent report or self-report). We recommend that QoL assessments in children born preterm should consider both parent report and self-report.","D000293; D000328; D044383; D002648; D003072; D000013; D005260; D006801; D007231; D007234; D001523; D011203; D011788; D012121; D012307; D057566; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Black People; Child; Cognition Disorders; Congenital Abnormalities; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Mental Disorders; Poverty; Quality of Life; Respiration, Artificial; Risk Factors; Self Report; Young Adult",NA,"NA",NA,"Martina Estevam Brom Vieira, Maria Beatriz Martins Linhares","Department of Neurosciences and Behavior, Ribeir&#xe3;o Preto Medical School, University of S&#xe3;o Paulo, Avenida Tenente Cat&#xe3;o Roxo, 2650, Pr&#xe9;dio da Sa&#xfa;de Mental, Campus Universit&#xe1;rio Monte Alegre, Ribeir&#xe3;o Preto, SP, CEP 14051-140, Brazil."

We aimed to assess the accuracy of a meal recall questionnaire, adapted for use with impoverished South Indian populations living in rural areas. Dietary data collected by recall versus weighed meals were compared. Data were obtained from 45 adults aged 19-85 years, living in rural Andhra Pradesh, who were recruited by convenience sampling. Weighed meal records (WMRs) were conducted in the household by a researcher aided by a trained field worker. The following day, field workers conducted a recall interview with the same participant. Eight life size photographs of portions of South Indian foods were created to aid each participant's recall and a database of nutrients was developed to calculate nutrient intake. Pearson correlations were used to assess the strength of associations between intake of energy and nutrients calculated from meal recalls versus WMRs. Least products regression was conducted to examine fixed and proportional bias. Bland-Altman plots were constructed to measure systematic or differential bias. Significant correlations were observed between estimates for energy and nutrients obtained by the two methods (r2=0.19-0.67, p&lt;0.001). No systematic bias was detected by Bland-Altman plots. Recall method underestimated the intake of protein and fat in a manner proportional to the level of intake.

Building on a robust literature from animal models showing that environmental deprivation or enrichment shapes the brain, there has been increasing interest in understanding how the experience of poverty may shape the brain in humans. In this review, we summarize research on the relationship between socioeconomic status and brain development, focusing on studies published in the last 5 years. Drawing on a conceptual framework informed by animal models, we highlight neural plasticity, epigenetics, material deprivation (eg, cognitive stimulation, nutrient deficiencies), stress (eg, negative parenting behaviors), and environmental toxins as factors that may shape the developing brain. We then summarize the existing evidence for the relationship between child poverty and brain structure and function, focusing on brain areas that support memory, emotion regulation, and higher-order cognitive functioning (ie, hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex) and regions that support language and literacy (ie, cortical areas of the left hemisphere).

Cross-sectional survey study of caregivers of hospitalized children. The survey collected information on caregiver opinion regarding their ability to ask physicians for help with social needs, whether physicians know how to help with those needs, and whether physicians should ask about social needs. The chi square test was used to identify associations between caregiver opinions, prior screening by a resident at admission, and SES (determined by census tract median household income). Surveys were completed by 143 caregivers (79% participation). Most respondents agreed that they could ask their physician for help (54.5%), that their physician knows how to help (64.3%), and that physicians should ask about social needs (71.3%). Previously screened caregivers had more favorable opinions about asking for help (76.2% vs 45.5%, P &lt; .01), whether their physician knows how to help (81.0% vs 57.4%, P = .02), and physician screening for unmet needs (85.7% vs 65.3%, P = .03).

This systematic review examined the evidence and experience of service user and caregiver involvement in mental health system strengthening, as well as models of best practice for evaluation of capacity-building activities that facilitate their greater participation. Both the peer-reviewed and the grey literature were included in the review, which were identified through database searches (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, SciELO, Google Scholar and Cochrane), as well as hand-searching of reference lists and the internet, and a snowballing process of contacting experts active in the area. This review included any kind of study design that described or evaluated service user, family or caregiver (though not community) involvement in LMICs (including service users with intellectual disabilities, dementia, or child and adolescent mental health problems) and that were relevant to mental health system strengthening across five categories. Data were extracted and summarised as a narrative review. Twenty papers matched the inclusion criteria. Overall, the review found that although there were examples of service user and caregiver involvement in mental health system strengthening in numerous countries, there was a lack of high-quality research and a weak evidence base for the work that was being conducted across countries. However, there was some emerging research on the development of policies and strategies, including advocacy work, and to a lesser extent the development of services, service monitoring and evaluation, with most service user involvement having taken place within advocacy and service delivery. Research was scarce within the other health system strengthening areas. Further research on service user and caregiver involvement in mental health system strengthening in LMICs is recommended, in particular research that includes more rigorous evaluation.

Adolescence is the peak time for initiation of substance use, with tobacco and alcohol usually preceding the use of illicit drugs. Substantial variation is noted between countries in the levels, types, and sequences of substance use in young people, indicating that a young person's use of substances depends on their social context, drug availability, and their personal characteristics. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study suggests that the burden attributable to substance use increases substantially in adolescence and young adulthood. In young men aged 20-24 years, alcohol and illicit substance use are responsible for 14% of total health burden. Alcohol causes most health burden in eastern Europe, and illicit drug burden is higher in the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and western Europe. Large gaps exist in epidemiological data about the extent of drug use worldwide and much of what we know about the natural history of substance use comes from cohort studies in high-income countries undertaken decades ago, which hinders effective global policy responses. In view of the global epidemiological transitions from diseases of poverty to non-communicable diseases, the burden of disease and health risks among adolescents and young adults is likely to change substantially, in ways that will no doubt see substance use playing an increasingly large part.","D000293; D002648; D014943; D006292; D006801; D019966; D055815","Adolescent; Child; Global Health; Health Priorities; Humans; Substance-Related Disorders; Young Adult",NA,"NA",NA,"Louisa Degenhardt, Emily Stockings, George Patton, Wayne D Hall, Michael Lynskey","National Addiction Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."

Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 92 male and female participants recruited from alcohol-serving venues in Cape Town, South Africa. Grounded theory analyses revealed three major aspects of parental drinking - intoxication, venue attendance and expenditures on alcohol - which participants linked to negative proximal outcomes (e.g., child neglect, abuse and exposure to alcohol culture) and long-term outcomes (e.g., fractured parent-child relationships and problematic youth behaviours). In addition, preliminary accounts from some participants suggested that parents may experience tensions between desires to reduce drinking for child-related reasons and complex factors maintaining their drinking behaviour, including the use of alcohol to cope with stressors and trauma. This study provides novel insights into the consequences and motivations of parental drinking in a high-risk context. Contextual risks (e.g., poverty and violence) that exacerbate the impact of parental drinking on children may be the same factors that continue to shape intergenerational alcohol use in this community.

However, the effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility and sustainability of this service model for people with a severe mental disorder (SMD) have not been evaluated in a low-income country. A randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial will be carried out in a predominantly rural area of Ethiopia. A sample of 324 people with SMD (diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder) with an ongoing need for mental health care will be recruited from 1) participants in a population-based cohort study and 2) people attending a psychiatric nurse-led out-patient clinic. The intervention is a task-sharing model of locally delivered mental health care for people with SMD integrated into PHC delivered over 18 months. Participants in the active control arm will receive the established and effective model of specialist mental health care delivered by psychiatric nurses at an out-patient clinic within a centrally located general hospital. The hypothesis is that people with SMD who receive mental health care integrated into PHC will have a non-inferior clinical outcome, defined as a mean symptom score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, expanded version, of no more than six points higher, compared to participants who receive the psychiatric nurse-led service, after 12 months. The primary outcome is change in symptom severity. Secondary outcomes are functional status, relapse, service use costs, service satisfaction, drop-out and medication adherence, nutritional status, physical health care, quality of care, medication side effects, stigma, adverse events and cost-effectiveness. Sustainability and cost-effectiveness will be further evaluated at 18 months. Randomisation will be stratified by health centre catchment area using random permuted blocks. The outcome assessors and investigators will be masked to allocation status.

This study illustrates the use of a hybrid methodology for variable selection that took account of missing data and complex survey design to identify key biomarkers associated with depression from a large epidemiological study. The study used a three-step methodology amalgamating multiple imputation, a machine learning boosted regression algorithm and logistic regression, to identify key biomarkers associated with depression in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study (2009-2010). Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and 67 biomarkers were analysed. Covariates in this study included gender, age, race, smoking, food security, Poverty Income Ratio, Body Mass Index, physical activity, alcohol use, medical conditions and medications. The final imputed weighted multiple logistic regression model included possible confounders and moderators. After the creation of 20 imputation data sets from multiple chained regression sequences, machine learning boosted regression initially identified 21 biomarkers associated with depression. Using traditional logistic regression methods, including controlling for possible confounders and moderators, a final set of three biomarkers were selected. The final three biomarkers from the novel hybrid variable selection methodology were red cell distribution width (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.01, 1.30), serum glucose (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.00, 1.01) and total bilirubin (OR 0.12; 95% CI 0.05, 0.28). Significant interactions were found between total bilirubin with Mexican American/Hispanic group (p = 0.016), and current smokers (p&lt;0.001). The systematic use of a hybrid methodology for variable selection, fusing data mining techniques using a machine learning algorithm with traditional statistical modelling, accounted for missing data and complex survey sampling methodology and was demonstrated to be a useful tool for detecting three biomarkers associated with depression for future hypothesis generation: red cell distribution width, serum glucose and total bilirubin.","D000293; D000328; D000368; D000369; D000465; D001663; D015415; D001786; D057225; D003866; D004909; D005260; D006801; D016015; D000069550; D008297; D008875; D015999; D009749; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Bilirubin; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Data Mining; Depressive Disorder; Erythrocyte Indices; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Nutrition Surveys; Young Adult",NA,"10.1093/ije/dys049; 10.1056/NEJMra1201534; 10.1038/mp.2014.139; 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2010.03.006; 10.1037/a0029014; 10.2337/dc09-S001; 10.2337/dc09-9033; 10.1371/journal.pone.0020416; 10.1002/sim.4067; 10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01390.x; 10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01803.x; 10.1370/afm.887; 10.1001/archinternmed.2009.55; 10.1093/eurjhf/hfp179; 10.1016/j.archger.2012.10.002; 10.1007/s00125-011-2331-1; 10.5009/gnl.2011.5.4.460; 10.1016/j.bbi.2009.04.011; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.11.029; 10.2337/dc08-0985; 10.1016/j.diabres.2010.01.024; 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2010.05.004","<b>Competing Interests: </b>JFD has no conflicts of interest.

The objectives were to assess the association between neighbourhood deprivation, completion of treatment to support quit attempts and success of quit attempts-while taking into account other predictors of outcome. 555,744 quit attempts supported by English Stop Smoking Services in 2009-2012 were linked to the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2010 ranks for the clients' neighbourhood and split into deciles relative to the national IMD. Logistic regressions tested the association between neighbourhood deprivation and completion (4-week follow-up) of treatment and biochemically validated success (expired-air carbon monoxide &lt;10 ppm) while adjusting for demographics and intervention characteristics. Sensitivity analyses assessed subsamples: first supported attempts (n = 364,397), those with recorded cigarette dependence (n = 98,659) and completed treatment (n = 416,436). Higher neighbourhood deprivation was associated with reduced completion (OR(adj) = 0.949, 95% CI: 0.947 to 0.951) and success (OR(adj) = 0.957, 95% CI: 0.955 to 0.959). Results of sensitivity analyses were consistent with those of the main analysis. Neighbourhood deprivation was associated with small but consistent reductions in completion and success of evidence-based interventions. These associations were not explained by intervention characteristics, demographics or dependence and reduced completion did not fully account for reduced success.","D000328; D016642; D005260; D006801; D016015; D008131; D008297; D008875; D018722; D010349; D011203; D012111; D012907; D016540; D000074606; D012923; D061485; D000068580","Adult; Bupropion; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; London; Male; Middle Aged; Nicotinic Agonists; Patient Compliance; Poverty; Residence Characteristics; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Smoking Prevention; Social Class; Tobacco Use Cessation Devices; Varenicline","MR/K023195/1","10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61228-8; 10.1136/jech-2014-204319; 10.1016/j.puhe.2012.05.014; 10.1093/pubmed/fdq072; 10.1111/j.1465-3362.2012.00452.x; 10.1136/tc.2007.024265; 10.1136/tc.2008.025981; 10.1111/j.1465-3362.2012.00427.x; 10.1093/ntr/ntq051; 10.1002/14651858.CD009329.pub2; 10.1002/14651858.CD008286.pub2; 10.1136/bmj.f4921; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2005.01026.x; 10.1136/tc.2007.021626; 10.1093/eurpub/cku065; 10.1136/tc.12.3.296; 10.1093/pubmed/fdq097; 10.1007/s00213-004-1971-y; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2013.07.010; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.00995.x; 10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.11.013; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2005.01028.x; 10.1080/14622200701673480; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.00756.x; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03565.x; 10.1037/a0036483; 10.1016/j.addbeh.2008.11.013; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02732.x","<b>Competing Interests: </b>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Leonie S Brose, Andy McEwen","National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training &amp; Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London, London, United Kingdom."

Subjects were 77 first-time mothers and 126 nulliparous young women from the Pittsburgh Girls Study, a longitudinal study beginning in childhood. Subjects underwent a monetary reward task during functional magnetic resonance imaging in addition to assessment of current depressive symptoms. Life stress was measured by averaging data collected between ages 8-15 years. Using a region-of-interest approach, we conducted hierarchical regression to examine the relationship of psychosocial factors (life stress and current depression) and motherhood with extracted ventral striatal (VST) response to reward anticipation. Whole-brain regression analyses were performed post-hoc to explore non-striatal regions associated with reward anticipation in mothers vs nulliparous women. Anticipation of monetary reward was associated with increased neural activity in expected regions including caudate, orbitofrontal, occipital, superior and middle frontal cortices. There was no main effect of motherhood nor motherhood-by-psychosocial factor interaction effect on VST response during reward anticipation. Depressive symptoms were associated with increased VST activity across the entire sample. In exploratory whole brain analysis, motherhood was associated with increased somatosensory cortex activity to reward (FWE cluster forming threshold p&lt;0.001). These findings indicate that motherhood is not associated with reward anticipation-related VST activity nor does motherhood modulate the impact of depression or life stress on VST activity. Future studies are needed to evaluate whether earlier postpartum assessment of reward function, inclusion of mothers with more severe depressive symptoms, and use of reward tasks specific for social reward might reveal an impact of motherhood on reward system activity.","D000293; D000328; D002648; D002675; D003863; D005260; D006801; D008137; D008913; D009035; D009042; D009434; D016487; D011203; D012201; D013315; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Depression; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Minority Groups; Mothers; Motivation; Neural Pathways; Parenting; Poverty; Reward; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult","MH093605; HD067185; MH056630; R01 HD067185; R01 MH056630; R01 MH093605","NA","<b>Conflict of Interest</b>.

Mothers of low socio-economic status and especially those living in crime-ridden areas are even more exposed to a host of risk factors. Societies of extreme violence, poverty and inequalities, often present difficulties to provide adequate mental health care to the most needed populations. The KINDEX, a brief standardized instrument that assesses 11 different risk factors was used by midwives to identify pregnant women at-risk, in a suburban area with one of the highest levels of domestic violence in Lima. The instrument was designed to be used by medical staff to identify high-risk child-bearing women and, based on the results, to refer them to the adequate psychological or social support providers. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of psychosocial screening using the KINDEX in a Latin American Country for the first time, and to explore the relationship of the KINDEX with thee major risk areas, maternal psychopathology, perceived stress and traumatic experiences. The study was conducted in cooperation with the gynecological department of a general hospital in a suburban area of Lima. Nine midwives conducted interviews using the KINDEX of ninety-five pregnant women attending the gynecological unit of the hospital. From these, forty pregnant women were re-interviewed by a clinical psychologist using established instruments in order to assess the feasibility of the prenatal assessment in public health settings and the relationship of the KINDEX with maternal perceived stress, psychopathology symptoms and trauma load during pregnancy. We found high rates of risk factors in the examined pregnant women comparable with those found in the general population. Significant correlations were found between the KINDEX sum score and the three risks areas, stress, psychopathology and trauma load as assessed in the Clinical Expert interviews. The different risks assessed by the KINDEX are related to higher levels of stress, psychopathology and trauma load, depending on the risk. The relationship between past adverse experience and current stressors with perceived maternal stress, psychopathology symptoms and traumatic experiences confirm the importance of prenatal assessment for psychosocial risks. The use of KINDEX by midwives providing obstetrical care to pregnant women in urban Peru is feasible and can be used to identify high-risk women and refer them to the adequate mental health or social services for necessary attention and support. Early interventions are essential to mitigating the adverse effects of maternal stress, trauma and psychopathology on the fetus and child.","D000328; D017579; D005240; D005260; D006801; D008880; D010568; D011203; D011247; D011248; D037841; D011296; D011569; D012307; D013315; D014754; D055815","Adult; Domestic Violence; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Midwifery; Peru; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnant Women; Prenatal Diagnosis; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Risk Factors; Stress, Psychological; Violence; Young Adult",NA,"10.1016/j.infbeh.2006.03.003; 10.1097/GRF.0b013e3181b52930; 10.1353/hpu.2008.0003; 10.1007/s00737-003-0034-4; 10.1016/j.chiabu.2003.07.006; 10.1017/S0954579407070186; 10.1002/icd.649; 10.1017/S0954579412000764; 10.1017/S0954579401003170; 10.1111/j.1542-2011.2012.00237.x; 10.1016/0145-2134(94)90083-3; 10.1016/j.ajog.2005.12.052; 10.1016/S0749-3797(03)00094-1; 10.1002/jts.20179; 10.1177/1077801208329387; 10.1111/j.1526-4610.2010.01777.x; 10.1177/0886260512471080; 10.4040/jkan.2012.42.4.477; 10.1016/j.infbeh.2009.10.004; 10.1002/da.10071; 10.1111/jcpp.12153; 10.1371/journal.pone.0116609; 10.1590/S1020-49892009001000004; 10.1016/j.infbeh.2011.02.005; 10.1002/nur.1023; 10.1136/adc.2007.133553; 10.1515/REVEH.2006.21.2.81; 10.1080/10550881003684723; 10.1111/1467-8624.00133; 10.1017/S0954579401003133; 10.1097/01.AOG.0000250535.97920.b5; 10.1023/A:1022537516969; 10.1037/0033-2909.131.5.662; 10.1001/archpedi.1996.02170260068011; 10.1093/humrep/del432; 10.1196/annals.1425.016; 10.1038/jp.2010.54; 10.1007/s00737-003-0169-3; 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2003.tb02529.x; 10.1186/s12884-015-0462-y; 10.1503/cmaj.1040610; 10.1016/j.wombi.2011.06.002; 10.1186/s13034-014-0030-7; 10.1056/NEJMcp1003896; 10.1067/mob.2002.122592; 10.1002/bs.3830190102; 10.1192/bjp.128.3.280; 10.2307/2136404; 10.1097/00006199-198805000-00007; 10.1016/j.jand.2012.07.002; 10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181d2f0b0; 10.1097/01.AOG.0000119222.40241.fb; 10.1080/01674820600712875; 10.1089/jwh.2009.1854; 10.1097/YCO.0b013e3283503680; 10.1016/j.jmwh.2008.08.001; 10.1007/s00404-012-2286-6; 10.1093/eurpub/cks097; 10.1017/S0033291709990894; 10.1186/1471-2393-13-49; 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2004.00307.x; 10.1111/j.1744-6171.2010.00229.x; 10.1177/0886260507304551; 10.1080/14767050701209560; 10.1126/science.1121400; 10.1067/mob.2003.336; 10.1176/appi.ajp.158.11.1856; 10.1146/annurev.psych.031809.130727",NA,"Andria Spyridou, Maggie Schauer, Martina Ruf-Leuschner","Center of Excellence for Psychotraumatology, Department of Psychology, Clinical Psychology &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience Unit, University of Konstanz, Post Box D 23, D-78457, Konstanz, Germany."

Participants were from a prospective longitudinal study of emotion development. Preschoolers 3-5 years of age were originally ascertained from primary care and day care sites in the St. Louis area and then underwent annual behavioral assessments for up to 12 years. Healthy preschoolers and those with a history of depression symptoms underwent neuroimaging at school age. Using functional MRI, the authors examined whole brain resting-state functional connectivity with the left and right hippocampus and amygdala. Lower income-to-needs ratio at preschool age was associated with reduced connectivity between hippocampus and amygdala and a number of regions at school age, including the superior frontal cortex, lingual gyrus, posterior cingulate, and putamen. Lower income-to-needs ratio predicted greater negative mood/depression severity at school age, as did connectivity between the left hippocampus and the right superior frontal cortex and between the right amygdala and the right lingual gyrus. Connectivity mediated the relationship between income-to-needs ratio and negative mood/depression at the time of scanning. These findings suggest that poverty in early childhood, as assessed by at least one measure, may influence the development of hippocampal and amygdala connectivity in a manner leading to negative mood symptoms during later childhood.","D000679; D002648; D003863; D005260; D059907; D006624; D006801; D008279; D008297; D009434; D011203","Amygdala; Child; Depression; Female; Functional Neuroimaging; Hippocampus; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neural Pathways; Poverty","R01 MH064769; R01 MH090786; T32 GM008151; T32 MH100019","NA","<b>Disclosures</b>.

One of the known environmental risk factors is exposure to life stressors. The aim of this project is to study the interaction between NR3C1 and CRHBP, genes thought to be involved in stress pathways, exposure to stressful life events, and adolescent alcohol use/misuse. The sample included 541 African American individuals (ages 13-18) from the Genes, Environment, and Neighborhood Initiative, a subset of the Mobile Youth Survey sample from whom DNA and more extensive phenotypic data were collected. Participants were selected from high-poverty neighborhoods in Mobile, Alabama, with potential exposure to a variety of extreme life stressors. A measure of stressful life events was significantly predictive of alcohol use/misuse. In addition, this association was significantly dependent upon the number of putative risk variants at rs1715749, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in CRHBP (P &#x2264; .006). There was no significant interaction between NR3C1 and stressful life events with respect to alcohol use/misuse, after taking into account multiple testing. These findings suggest that CRHBP variants are potentially relevant for adolescent alcohol use/misuse among African American youth populations being reared within the context of stressful life events and warrant replication.","D000293; D001741; D000437; D002352; D005260; D020022; D014644; D006801; D008016; D008297; D011203; D011965; D013315; D000066608","Adolescent; Black or African American; Alcoholism; Carrier Proteins; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Humans; Life Change Events; Male; Poverty; Receptors, Glucocorticoid; Stress, Psychological; Underage Drinking","UL1 TR000058; F32 AA022269; K02 AA018755; K01 AA020333; R01 DA025039","NA",NA,"Neeru Goyal, Fazil Aliev, Shawn J Latendresse, Darlene A Kertes, John M Bolland, Gayle R Byck, Brian Mustanski, Jessica E Salvatore, Danielle M Dick","a Department of Human and Molecular Genetics , School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , Virginia , USA."

Children are especially vulnerable to social influences, particularly in their early years. Adverse social exposures in childhood can lead to chronic disorders later in life. Here, we sought to identify and evaluate the impact of social factors on child health in Ghana. As Ghana is unlikely to achieve the Millennium Development Goals' target of reducing child mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015, we deemed it necessary to identify social determinants that might have contributed to the non-realisation of this goal. ScienceDirect, PubMed, MEDLINE via EBSCO and Google Scholar were searched for published articles reporting on the influence of social factors on child health in Ghana. After screening the 98 articles identified, 34 of them that met our inclusion criteria were selected for qualitative review. Major social factors influencing child health in the country include maternal education, rural-urban disparities (place of residence), family income (wealth/poverty) and high dependency (multiparousity). These factors are associated with child mortality, nutritional status of children, completion of immunisation programmes, health-seeking behaviour and hygiene practices. Several social factors influence child health outcomes in Ghana. Developing more effective responses to these social determinants would require sustainable efforts from all stakeholders including the Government, healthcare providers and families. We recommend the development of interventions that would support families through direct social support initiatives aimed at alleviating poverty and inequality, and indirect approaches targeted at eliminating the dependence of poor health outcomes on social factors. Importantly, the expansion of quality free education interventions to improve would-be-mother's health knowledge is emphasised.","D002648; D000067576; D016208; D003695; D005869; D006291; D006801; D009035; D009752; D012424; D012944","Child; Child Health; Databases, Factual; Delivery of Health Care; Ghana; Health Policy; Humans; Mothers; Nutritional Status; Rural Population; Social Support","BB/J014532/1","10.2105/AJPH.2005.061812; 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003463; 10.1542/peds.2015-0491; 10.1155/2015/298409; 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61690-6; 10.1056/NEJMra0708473; 10.1017/S0954579400004776; 10.1007/BF02888596; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097; 10.1017/S1368980007226035; 10.1016/0167-6296(95)00021-6; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.11.032; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2006.01660.x; 10.1016/j.jhealeco.2013.08.001; 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005340; 10.1016/j.healthplace.2008.05.002; 10.1017/S0021932014000340; 10.1016/S0169-5150(97)00011-X; 10.1093/heapol/10.3.312; 10.1007/s001480050080; 10.1111/tmi.12324; 10.1017/S0021932007001927; 10.1017/S1368980014000834; 10.1186/1472-698X-14-24; 10.1186/1471-2393-14-165; 10.1371/journal.pone.0017774; 10.1093/heapro/dau069; 10.1016/S0305-750X(99)00097-2; 10.1186/1475-9276-6-21; 10.1186/s12889-014-1332-7; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.08.057; 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61257-3; 10.2307/3004028; 10.1017/S0021932012000041; 10.1016/S0277-9536(96)00224-9; 10.1016/j.healthplace.2014.06.003; 10.1177/0141076813489680; 10.1080/03050060902920534; 10.1016/j.ijedudev.2012.09.011; 10.1186/1478-4491-9-13; 10.1371/journal.pone.0120556; 10.1186/1742-4755-11-90; 10.1186/1472-6963-14-340; 10.1002/hpm.2304; 10.1186/s12889-015-1696-3; 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.10.025; 10.1186/s12913-014-0637-7; 10.1186/s12913-015-0996-8; 10.1080/08959420.2015.1056650; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02439.x; 10.1186/s12913-015-0762-y; 10.1590/0104-1169.3308.2434; 10.1186/1478-4505-12-16; 10.1186/1471-2393-13-211; 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2007.01981.x; 10.1186/1471-2393-12-50; 10.1179/146532810X12858955921311","<b>Competing Interests: </b>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","Emmanuel Quansah, Lilian Akorfa Ohene, Linda Norman, Michael Osei Mireku, Thomas K Karikari","Neuroscience, School of Life Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, Uunited Kingdom."

Discrete-choice conjoint experiment (DCE) added to systematic focus group data collection and analysis. Focus group data were collected from 64 patients of a Federally-Qualified Health Center (FQHC) serving a predominantly low-income Hispanic population. A total of 604 patients in the waiting rooms of the FQHC responded to the DCE. The DCE contained 15 choice tasks that each asked respondents to choose between three mental health services options described by the levels of two (of eight) attributes based on themes that emerged from focus group data. The addition of the DCE was found to be feasible and useful in providing distinct information on relative patient preferences compared with the focus group analyses alone. According to market simulations, the package of mental health services guided by the results of the DCE was preferred by patients. Unique patterns of patient preferences were uncovered by the DCE and these findings were useful in identifying pragmatic solutions to better address the mental health service needs of this population.

We tested the hypothesis that maternal fatigue would be associated independently with maternal common mental disorder ('maternal CMD') in a rural, low-income country setting. The analysis was conducted using data from a population-based cohort located in the Butajira demographic surveillance site, Ethiopia. A total of 1065 women were recruited in pregnancy and followed up to 2.5 (n = 1009; 94.7%) and 3.5 years post-partum (n = 989; 92.9%). Maternal CMD symptoms were measured using a locally validated version of the Self-Reporting Questionnaire and fatigue was measured using a dichotomised item from the Patient Health Questionnaire-15. Physical health indicators included haemoglobin level, body mass index and illness episodes. Generalised estimating equations were used to conduct hypothesis-driven and exploratory multivariable analyses in the panel at 2.5 and 3.5 years. The prevalence of maternal fatigue was 8.3% at 2.5 years and 5.5% at 3.5 years post-partum. Psychological symptoms of maternal CMD were associated independently with complaints of fatigue after adjusting for anaemia, body mass index, physical ill health, poverty and other confounding variables: adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.28-1.66 for each one point increase in SRQ score. In the multivariable model, only psychosocial factors (CMD and stressful life events) and self-reported physical ill health were associated significantly with complaints of fatigue. Complaints of fatigue are associated strongly with maternal CMD and other psychosocial risk factors in this rural, low-income country setting with a high burden of undernutrition and infectious disease. Fatigue should be understood as a potential indicator of CMD in primary care to improve detection and treatment.

This study describes the experiences and perspectives of these community care providers involved with program referrals or service delivery to mothers who participated in the Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP), a targeted nurse home-visit program. The study included two phases. Phase I was a secondary qualitative data analysis used to analyze a purposeful sample of 24 individual interviews of community care providers. This was part of a larger case study examining adaptations required to increase acceptability of the NFP in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. In Phase II (n = 4), themes identified from Phase I were further explored through individual, semi-structured interviews with community health care and social service providers, giving qualitative description. Overall, the NFP was viewed as addressing an important service gap for first-time mothers. Providers suggested that frequent communication between the NFP and community agencies serving these mothers could help improve the referral process, avoid service duplication, and streamline the flow of service access. The findings can help determine key components required to enhance the success of integrating a home-visit program into an existing network of community services. The function of home-visit programs should not be viewed in isolation. Rather, their potential can be maximized when they collaborate and share information with other agencies to provide better services for first-time mothers.

Evidence from three United States randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness of this intervention at improving pregnancy outcomes, improving child health and development, and increasing maternal economic self-sufficiency is robust. However, the effectiveness of the NFP in Canada, with its different health and social care context, needs to be determined. The purpose of this article is to describe the complex process for moving the NFP from the research arena to full implementation in Canada. This process of evaluation in Canada includes (1) adapting the intervention; (2) piloting the intervention in small-scale feasibility and acceptability studies; and (3) conducting an RCT and process evaluation through a study called the British Columbia Healthy Connections Project (BCHCP). This large-scale evaluation also creates an opportunity to expand the NFP evidence base by conducting an additional study to examine potential biological mechanisms linking intervention and behavioural outcomes in children. Adaptation of the NFP home-visit materials is a continuous process. A pilot project determined that it was feasible to enrol eligible women into the NFP. This pilot also determined that, in Canada, it was most appropriate for public health agencies to implement the NFP and for public health nurses to deliver the intervention. Finally, the pilot showed that this intensive home-visit program was acceptable to clients, their family members and health care providers. Through the BCHCP, the next steps - the RCT and process evaluation - are currently underway. The BCHCP will also set the foundation for long-term evaluation of key public health outcomes in a highly vulnerable population of families.

Many of the differences are explained by the wide variation in population demographics and size, poverty, conflict, culture, land area and quality, and genetics. Neurological, psychiatric, developmental and substance-use disorders that result from, or are worsened by, a lack of adequate nutrition and infectious disease still afflict much of sub-Saharan Africa, although disorders related to increasing longevity, such as stroke, are on the rise. In the Middle East and North Africa, major depressive disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder are a primary concern because of the conflict-ridden environment. Consanguinity is a serious concern that leads to the high prevalence of recessive disorders in the Middle East and North Africa and possibly other regions. The burden of these disorders in Latin American and Asian countries largely surrounds stroke and vascular disease, dementia and lifestyle factors that are influenced by genetics. Although much knowledge has been gained over the past 10 years, the epidemiology of the conditions in low- and middle-income countries still needs more research. Prevention and treatments could be better informed with more longitudinal studies of risk factors. Challenges and opportunities for ameliorating nervous-system disorders can benefit from both local and regional research collaborations. The lack of resources and infrastructure for health-care and related research, both in terms of personnel and equipment, along with the stigma associated with the physical or behavioural manifestations of some disorders have hampered progress in understanding the disease burden and improving brain health.

This gap exists despite potentially greater dependence on social networks for support and survival due to various barriers to health care and social protection schemes in this setting. Thus, this study aims to examine how social network type at baseline predicts all-cause mortality among older adults in six Latin American countries, China, and India. Population-based surveys were conducted of all individuals aged 65+ years in eight countries (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Peru, Venezuela, Mexico, Puerto Rico, China, and India). Data on mortality were obtained at follow-up (mean 3.8 years after cohort inception). Follow-up data for 13,891 individuals were analysed. Social network types were assessed using Wenger's Practitioner Assessment of Network Type (PANT). Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to estimate the impact of social network type on mortality risk in each country, adjusting for socio-demographics, receipt of pension, disability, medical conditions, and depression. Meta-analysis was performed to obtain pooled estimates. The prevalence of private network type was 64.4% in urban China and 1.6% in rural China, while the prevalence of locally integrated type was 6.6% in urban China and 86.8% in rural China. The adjusted pooled estimates across (a) all countries and (b) Latin America showed that, compared to the locally integrated social network type, the locally self-contained [(b) HR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.01-1.51], family dependent [(a) HR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.26; (b) HR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.001-1.28], and private [(a) HR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.06-1.73; (b) HR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.20-1.75] social network types were significantly associated with higher mortality risk. Survival time is significantly reduced in individuals embedded in restricted social networks (i.e. locally self-contained, family dependent, and private network types). Social care interventions may be enhanced by addressing the needs of those most at risk of neglect and deteriorating health.

While the World Health Organization recognizes seventeen priority NTDs, the list of conditions present in Africa and elsewhere that are eligible to be classified as NTDs is much longer. Although NTDs are generally marginalized, their associated neurological burden has been almost completely disregarded. However, reports indicate that trichuriasis, schistosomiasis and hookworm infection, among others, cause impairments in memory and cognition, negatively affecting school attendance rates and educational performance particularly among children, as well as agricultural productivity among adults. Consequently, the neurological impairments have substantial influence on education and economic productivity, thus aggravating and perpetuating poverty in affected societies. However, inadequate research, policy and public health attention has been paid to the neurological burdens associated with NTDs. In order to appropriately address these burdens, we recommend the development of policy interventions that focus on the following areas: (i) the introduction of training programs to develop the capacity of scientists and clinicians in research, diagnostic and treatment approaches (ii) the establishment of competitive research grant schemes to fund cutting-edge research into these neurological impairments, and (iii) the development of public health interventions to improve community awareness of the NTD-associated neurological problems, possibly enhancing disease prevention and expediting treatment.",NA,NA,NA,"NA",NA,"Emmanuel Quansah, Esther Sarpong, Thomas K Karikari","Neuroscience, School of Life Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK; Midlands Integrative Biosciences Training Partnership, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK."

We searched six databases from 1980 to 2013 and conducted a multi-language Google search for quantitative studies addressing the research questions. Effect sizes were calculated from eligible studies where possible, and narrative syntheses conducted. Subgroup analysis compared interventions with and without social contact. Eighty studies (n = 422 653) were included in the review. For studies with medium or long-term follow-up (72, of which 21 had calculable effect sizes) median standardised mean differences were 0.54 for knowledge and -0.26 for stigmatising attitudes. Those containing social contact (direct or indirect) were not more effective than those without. The 11 LMIC studies were all from middle-income countries. Effect sizes were rarely calculable for behavioural outcomes or in LMIC studies. There is modest evidence for the effectiveness of anti-stigma interventions beyond 4 weeks follow-up in terms of increasing knowledge and reducing stigmatising attitudes.

Epidemiological studies have suggested that this covariation is due, in part, to common genetic influences, and a number of plausible candidates have emerged as targets for investigation. To date, however, genetic association studies of these behaviors have focused mostly on unidimensional models of individual phenotypes within European American samples. Herein, we compared a series of confirmatory factor models to best characterize the structure of problem behavior (alcohol and marijuana use, sexual behavior, and disruptive behavior) within a representative community-based sample of 592 low-income African American adolescents (50.3% female), ages 13 to 18. We further explored the extent to which 3 genes previously implicated for their role in similar behavioral dimensions (CHRM2, GABRA2, and OPRM1) independently accounted for variance within factors specified in the best-fitting model. Supplementary analyses were conducted to derive comparative estimates for the predictive utility of these genes in more traditional unidimensional models. Findings provide initial evidence for a bifactor structure of problem behavior among African American adolescents and highlight novel genetic correlates of specific behavioral dimensions otherwise undetected in an orthogonal syndromal factor. Implications of this approach include increased precision in the assessment of problem behavior, with corresponding increases in the reliability and validity of identified genetic associations. As a corollary, the comparison of primary and supplementary association analyses illustrates the potential for overlooking and/or overinterpreting meaningful genetic effects when failing to adequately account for phenotypic complexity.","D000293; D000294; D001741; D005260; D006801; D008297; D011203; D000066553; D015203; D014481","Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Black or African American; Female; Humans; Male; Poverty; Problem Behavior; Reproducibility of Results; United States","K01 AA020333; K02 AA018755; R01 DA025039","10.1101/gr.094052.109; 10.1017/S0954579400004612; 10.1093/bioinformatics/bth457; 10.1037/0033-2909.88.3.588; 10.1016/S0193-953X(05)70074-5; 10.1177/0049124192021002005; 10.1007/s00127-013-0657-3; 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2011.00739.x; 10.1111/j.1745-7599.2012.00702.x; 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.02.004; 10.1037/a0022939; 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00530.x; 10.1001/archpsyc.65.3.310; 10.1007/s10519-005-9041-8; 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.90; 10.3389/fpsyt.2011.00017; 10.1038/sj.mp.4001368; 10.1097/00004583-200106000-00008; 10.1037/0022-006X.53.6.890; 10.1037/0022-006X.56.5.762; 10.1086/383283; 10.1186/1471-2350-9-35; 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2009.02.009; 10.1007/s10802-011-9511-9; 10.1080/10705519909540118; 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01637.x; 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1987.tb01490.x; 10.1037/0012-1649.31.6.923; 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2010.01427.x; 10.1001/archpsyc.60.9.929; 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp218; 10.1037/0021-843X.109.3.488; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01640.x; 10.1038/jhg.2010.150; 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2008.00768.x; 10.1186/1471-2156-6-S1-S104; 10.1073/pnas.1031521100; 10.1002/ajmg.b.20034; 10.1001/archpsyc.62.12.1352; 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02232.x; 10.1093/hmg/ddn289; 10.1037/0022-006X.60.5.766; 10.1111/jora.12053; 10.1007/s10508-013-0215-9; 10.1037/0022-0167.49.2.172; 10.1086/383251; 10.1371/journal.pone.0034861; 10.1177/0272431607313591; 10.1007/s11136-007-9183-7; 10.1037/0022-006X.63.4.594; 10.1186/gb-2002-3-7-comment2007; 10.1016/j.paid.2014.11.036; 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.01120.x; 10.1097/00004583-200001000-00014; 10.1111/j.1521-0391.2012.00253.x; 10.1001/archpsyc.62.9.1042; 10.1038/nrg796; 10.1007/BF02291170; 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003235; 10.1371/journal.pone.0013929; 10.1073/pnas.0812612106; 10.2307/270754; 10.1093/hmg/ddl024",NA,"Shawn J Latendresse, David B Henry, Steven H Aggen, Gayle R Byck, Alan W Ashbeck, John M Bolland, Cuie Sun, Brien P Riley, Brian Mustanski, Danielle M Dick","c Department of Psychiatry , Virginia Commonwealth University."

A total of 1,724,398 study subjects between the ages of 15 and 64, including 10,095 subjects with mental disability only, were used for the analysis. Wealth status was estimated by a wealth index that was derived from a principal component analysis of 10 household assets and four other variables related to wealth. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for mental disability for each category, with the lowest quintile category as the referent. Confounding variables under consideration were age, gender, residence area, marital status, ethnicity, education, current employment status, household size, house type, homeownership and living arrangement. The distribution of various types and severities of mental disability differed significantly by wealth index category in the present population. Wealth index category had a positive association with mild mental disability (p for trend &lt;0.01), but had a negative association with extremely severe mental disability (p for trend &lt;0.01). Moreover, wealth index category had a significant, inverse association with mental disability when all severities of mental disability were taken into consideration. This study's results suggest that wealth is a significant factor in the distribution of mental disability and it might have different influences on various types and severities of mental disability.","D000293; D000328; D000368; D044466; D002681; D015986; D006233; D005191; D005260; D006801; D008607; D008297; D001523; D008875; D016017; D011203; D012107; D012111; D012424; D012959; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Asian People; China; Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic; Disabled Persons; Family Characteristics; Female; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Poverty; Research Design; Residence Characteristics; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult",NA,"10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61238-0; 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60660-7; 10.2471/BLT.11.089730; 10.1136/jech.57.7.501; 10.1080/14034940410019190; 10.1093/eurpub/cki070; 10.1177/00343552070500040101; 10.1111/j.1475-4991.2012.00520.x; 10.1016/j.chieco.2014.05.017; 10.1177/1044207311411299; 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16458-1; 10.1073/pnas.1403158111",NA,"Zhenjie Wang, Wei Du, Lihua Pang, Lei Zhang, Gong Chen, Xiaoying Zheng","Institute of Population Research/WHO Collaborating Center on Reproductive Health and Population Science, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."

Oxytocin appears to be a potent modulator of amygdala reactivity and neuroendocrine responses to psychosocial stress. Given these stress regulatory effects, there is increasing interest in understanding the role of oxytocin in vulnerability to stress-related clinical disorders. The present study examines the impact of a common functional variant within the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene (rs2254298) on structure and function of the amygdala in a high-risk sample of urban, low-income, minority youth with a high incidence of early life stress (ELS). Compared to G/G homozygotes, youth carrying the OXTR A-allele showed increased amygdala volume, reduced behavioral performance, and heightened amygdala response during two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks that involved viewing socially-relevant face stimuli. Higher amygdala response was related to ELS in A-allele carriers but not G/G homozygotes. These findings underscore a series of relations among a common oxytocin system gene variant, ELS exposure, and structure and function of the amygdala in early life. Heightened amygdala response to salient social cues in OXTR A-allele carriers may elevate risk for emotional psychopathology by increasing amygdala involvement in disambiguating environmental cues, particularly for individuals with ELS.","D000293; D000679; D002648; D003463; D004644; D005260; D007839; D005838; D066128; D006801; D007091; D008279; D008297; D008913; D010100; D010364; D010775; D020641; D011203; D011569; D018045; D013315","Adolescent; Amygdala; Child; Cues; Emotions; Female; Functional Laterality; Genotype; Gray Matter; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Minority Groups; Oxygen; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Photic Stimulation; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Poverty; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Receptors, Oxytocin; Stress, Psychological","R01 NS074980; P30ES020957; R01NS074980; P30 CA022453; P30CA022453; P30 ES020957; R01 HD075806; R21 ES026022","NA",NA,"Hilary A Marusak, Daniella J Furman, Nisha Kuruvadi, David W Shattuck, Shantanu H Joshi, Anand A Joshi, Amit Etkin, Moriah E Thomason","Merill Palmer Skillman Institute for Child and Family Development, Wayne State University, 71 E Ferry Street, Dertroit, MI 48202, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, USA."

Total and left hemisphere adult amygdala volumes were positively related to cumulative risk exposure during childhood. The links between childhood cumulative risk exposure and elevated amygdala responses to emotionally neutral facial stimuli in adulthood were mediated by the corresponding amygdala volumes. Cumulative risk exposure in later adolescence (17 years of age), however, was unrelated to subsequent adult amygdala volume or function. Physical and socioemotional risk exposures early in life appear to alter amygdala development, rendering adults more reactive to ambiguous stimuli such as neutral faces.

Nurturing social experience during this time promotes the acquisition of social and cognitive skills and emotional competencies. However, many young children are confronted with obstacles to healthy development, including poverty, inappropriate care, and violence, and their enhanced sensitivity to the social environment means that they are highly susceptible to these adverse childhood experiences. One source of social adversity in early life can stem from parenting that is harsh, inconsistent, non-sensitive or hostile. Parenting is considered to be the cornerstone of early socio-emotional development and an adverse parenting style is associated with adjustment problems and a higher risk of developing mood and behavioral disorders. Importantly, there is a growing literature showing that an important predictor of parenting behavior is how parents, especially mothers, were parented themselves. In this review, we examine how adversity in early-life affects mothering behavior in later-life and how these effects may be perpetuated inter-generationally. Relying on studies in humans and animal models, we consider evidence for the intergenerational transmission of mothering styles. We then describe the psychological underpinnings of mothering, including responsiveness to young, executive function and affect, as well as the physiological mediators of mothering behavior, including hormones, brain regions and neurotransmitters, and we consider how development in these relevant domains may be affected by adversity experienced in early life. Finally, we explore how genes and early experience interact to predict mothering behavior, including the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms. Understanding how adverse parenting begets adverse parenting in the next generation is critical for designing interventions aimed at preventing this intergenerational cycle of early adversity.","D000818; D001921; D044127; D059647; D006801; D007858; D008425; D016487","Animals; Brain; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene-Environment Interaction; Humans; Learning; Maternal Behavior; Parenting",NA,"NA",NA,"A M Lomanowska, M Boivin, C Hertzman, A S Fleming","Department of Psychology, University of Toronto Mississauga, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; Fraser Mustard Institute for Human Development, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1V6, Canada."

Toxocara seroprevalence did not vary with age or blood-lead concentration but did vary with gender, ethnicity, educational attainment and poverty-to-income ratio. Controlling for gender, age, blood-lead concentration, educational attainment, ethnic background and the poverty-to-income ratio, we found that toxocariasis predicted worse performance on the SDS but not on the SRT or the SDL. Moreover, there were significant interactions between toxocariasis and age, gender and educational attainment. In conclusion, toxocariasis appears to be associated with decreased cognitive function.

Accumulating clinical and pre-clinical evidence suggests that the primary motor cortex (M1) is involved in the pathophysiology of PD and that modulating cortical activity may be a therapeutic target in PD and dyskinesia. However, surprisingly little is known about how M1 neurotransmitter tone or gene expression is altered in PD, dyskinesia or associated animal models. The present study utilized the rat unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of PD/dyskinesia to characterize structural and functional changes taking place in M1 monoamine innervation and gene expression. 6-OHDA caused dopamine pathology in M1, although the lesion was less severe than in the striatum. Rats with 6-OHDA lesions showed a PD motor impairment and developed dyskinesia when given L-DOPA or the D1 receptor agonist, SKF81297. M1 expression of two immediate-early genes (c-Fos and ARC) was strongly enhanced by either L-DOPA or SKF81297. At the same time, expression of genes specifically involved in glutamate and GABA signaling were either modestly affected or unchanged by lesion and/or treatment. We conclude that M1 neurotransmission and signal transduction in the rat 6-OHDA model of PD/dyskinesia mirror features of human PD, supporting the utility of the model to study M1 dysfunction in PD and the elucidation of novel pathophysiological mechanisms and therapeutic targets.","D000386; D000818; D001552; D004195; D015259; D004409; D007839; D015870; D007980; D008297; D008474; D009044; D016627; D020734; D016760; D051381; D017207; D012720; D009435","AIDS-Related Complex; Animals; Benzazepines; Disease Models, Animal; Dopamine Agents; Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced; Functional Laterality; Gene Expression; Levodopa; Male; Medial Forebrain Bundle; Motor Cortex; Oxidopamine; Parkinsonian Disorders; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Severity of Illness Index; Synaptic Transmission","F31 NS066684; R01 NS059600; F31-NS066684; R01-NS059600","NA",NA,"D Lindenbach, M M Conti, C Y Ostock, K B Dupre, C Bishop","Behavioral Neuroscience Program, Department of Psychology, Binghamton University - State University of New York, Binghamton, NY, USA."

However, screening of impairments is a significant challenge in low-resource countries. We adapted and validated the rapid neurodevelopmental assessment (RNDA) instrument developed in Bangladesh to assess impairment in nine domains: primitive reflexes, gross and fine motor development, vision, hearing, speech, cognition, behaviour and seizures. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 77 infants (0-12&#x2009;months) in rural Guatemala in July 2012 and July 2013. We assessed inter-rater reliability and predictive validity between the 27-item RNDA and the 325-item Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III) and concurrent validity based on chronic malnutrition, a condition associated with neurodevelopmental impairments. For both RNDA and BSID-III, standardized scores below 80 were defined as borderline impairment. Children came from rural households (92%), were born to indigenous women of Mayan descent (73%) and had moderate or severe growth stunting (43%). Inter-rater reliability for eight RNDA domains was of moderate to high reliability (weighted &#x3ba; coefficients, 0.49-0.99). Children screened positive for impairment in fine motor (17%) and gross motor (14%) domains using the RNDA.

The longer children live in poverty, the greater their academic deficits. These patterns persist to adulthood, contributing to lifetime-reduced occupational attainment. To determine whether atypical patterns of structural brain development mediate the relationship between household poverty and impaired academic performance. Longitudinal cohort study analyzing 823 magnetic resonance imaging scans of 389 typically developing children and adolescents aged 4 to 22 years from the National Institutes of Health Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of Normal Brain Development with complete sociodemographic and neuroimaging data. Data collection began in November 2001 and ended in August 2007. Participants were screened for a variety of factors suspected to adversely affect brain development, recruited at 6 data collection sites across the United States, assessed at baseline, and followed up at 24-month intervals for a total of 3 periods. Each study center used community-based sampling to reflect regional and overall US demographics of income, race, and ethnicity based on the US Department of Housing and Urban Development definitions of area income. One-quarter of sample households reported the total family income below 200% of the federal poverty level. Repeated observations were available for 301 participants. Household poverty measured by family income and adjusted for family size as a percentage of the federal poverty level. Children's scores on cognitive and academic achievement assessments and brain tissue, including gray matter of the total brain, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and hippocampus. Poverty is tied to structural differences in several areas of the brain associated with school readiness skills, with the largest influence observed among children from the poorest households. Regional gray matter volumes of children below 1.5 times the federal poverty level were 3 to 4 percentage points below the developmental norm (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.05). A larger gap of 8 to 10 percentage points was observed for children below the federal poverty level (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.05). These developmental differences had consequences for children's academic achievement. On average, children from low-income households scored 4 to 7 points lower on standardized tests (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.05). As much as 20% of the gap in test scores could be explained by maturational lags in the frontal and temporal lobes. The influence of poverty on children's learning and achievement is mediated by structural brain development. To avoid long-term costs of impaired academic functioning, households below 150% of the federal poverty level should be targeted for additional resources aimed at remediating early childhood environments.","D000293; D001921; D002648; D002657; D002675; D004522; D005191; D005260; D054624; D006801; D008137; D008279; D008297; D009483; D011203; D012923; D012959; D014481; D055815","Adolescent; Brain; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Educational Status; Family Characteristics; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Poverty; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; Young Adult","N01-HD02-3343; N01-MH9-0002; N01-NS-9-2314; N01-NS-9-2319; N01-NS-9-2315; N01 HD023343; R01 MH061285; P2C HD047873; N01-NS-9-2317; N01-NS-9-2316; N01-NS-9-2320","NA","<b>Conflict of Interest Disclosures:</b> None reported.","Nicole L Hair, Jamie L Hanson, Barbara L Wolfe, Seth D Pollak","Department of Psychology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison7Waisman Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison."

We do so in three ways. First, we propose the need for a new, ""see through"" taxonomy for knowledge-based innovation as we transition from the material industries (e.g., textiles, plastic, cement, glass) dominant in the 20(th) century to the anticipated knowledge industry of the 21st century. If knowledge is the currency of the present century, then it is sensible to adopt an approach that thoroughly examines scientific knowledge, starting with the production aims, methods, quality, distribution, access, and the ends it purports to serve. Second, we explain that this knowledge trajectory focus on innovation is crucial and applicable across all sectors, including public, private, or public-private partnerships, as it underscores the fact that scientific knowledge is a co-product of technology, human values, and social systems. By making the value systems embedded in scientific design and knowledge co-production transparent, we all stand to benefit from sustainable and transparent science.

We utilised data collected by the 10/66 research group to investigate the lifetime prevalence of head injury in defined sites in low and middle income countries, its risk factors and its relationship with disability. We analysed data from one-phase cross-sectional surveys of all residents aged 65 years and older (n = 16430) distributed across twelve sites in eight low and middle income countries (China, Cuba, Dominican Republic, India, Venezuela, Mexico, Peru, and Puerto Rico). Self-reported cases of head injury with loss of consciousness were identified during the interview. A sensitivity analysis including data provided by informants of people with dementia was also used to estimate the impact of this information on the estimates. Prevalence ratios (PR) from Poisson regressions were used to identify associated risk factors. The standardised lifetime prevalence of TBI ranged from 0.3% in China to 14.6% in rural Mexico and Venezuela. Being male (PR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.29-1.82), younger (PR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.99), with lower education (PR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.86-0.96), and having fewer assets (PR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88-0.96), was associated with a higher prevalence of TBI when pooling estimates across sites.

This gap is greatest in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Efforts to scale up mental health services in LMICs have to contend with the paucity of mental health professionals and health facilities providing specialist services for mental, neurological and substance use (MNS) disorders. A pragmatic solution is to improve access to care through the facilities that exist closest to the community, via a task-shifting strategy. This study describes a pilot implementation program to integrate mental health services into primary health care in Nigeria. The program was implemented over 18 months in 8 selected local government areas (LGAs) in Osun state of Nigeria, using the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG), which had been contextualized for the local setting. A well supervised cascade training model was utilized, with Master Trainers providing training for the Facilitators, who in turn conducted several rounds of training for front-line primary health care workers. The first set of trainings by the Facilitators was supervised and mentored by the Master Trainers and refresher trainings were provided after 9 months. A total of 198 primary care workers, from 68 primary care clinics, drawn from 8 LGAs with a combined population of 966,714 were trained in the detection and management of four MNS conditions: moderate to severe major depression, psychosis, epilepsy, and alcohol use disorders, using the mhGAP-IG. Following training, there was a marked improvement in the knowledge and skills of the health workers and there was also a significant increase in the numbers of persons identified and treated for MNS disorders, and in the number of referrals. Even though substantial retention of gained knowledge was observed nine months after the initial training, some level of decay had occurred supporting the need for a refresher training. It is feasible to scale up mental health services in primary care settings in Nigeria, using the mhGAP-IG and a well-supervised cascade-training model. This format of training is pragmatic, cost-effective and holds promise, especially in settings where there are few specialists.","D000328; D003362; D019033; D003865; D003906; D005260; D006282; D006801; D008297; D008605; D009549; D010865; D011203; D011320; D012017; D019966","Adult; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Depressive Disorder, Major; Developing Countries; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Mental Health Services; Nigeria; Pilot Projects; Poverty; Primary Health Care; Referral and Consultation; Substance-Related Disorders",NA,"10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61414-7; 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2008.01693.x; 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61729-2; 10.1192/bjp.186.5.436; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61263-X; 10.4314/ajpsy.v13i2.54359; 10.1186/1752-4458-5-8; 10.1186/1472-6963-13-368; 10.3109/09540261.2010.536152; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61239-2; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001501; 10.1016/S0033-3182(00)71172-8; 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001225",NA,"Oye Gureje, Jibril Abdulmalik, Lola Kola, Emmanuel Musa, Mohammad Taghi Yasamy, Kazeem Adebayo","Department of Psychiatry, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Nigeria."

The burden of care on caregivers of people living with MDs was assessed in two districts located in the middle part of Ghana. Coping strategies and available support for caregivers of MDs were also assessed. A qualitative study was carried out involving 75 caregivers of participants with MDs registered within the Kintampo Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems.

Caregivers reported various degrees of burden, which included financial, social exclusion, emotional, depression, and inadequate time for other social responsibilities. Responsibilities around caregiving were mostly shared among close relatives but to a varying and limited extent. Religious prayers and the anticipation of cure were the main coping strategies adopted by caregivers, with expectation of new treatments being discovered. Emotional distress, stigma, financial burden, lack of support networks, social exclusion, health impact, and absence of decentralised mental health services were experienced by family caregivers. These findings highlight the need for interventions to support people with MDs and their caregivers. This might include policy development and implementation that will decentralise mental health care provision including psychosocial support for caregivers.

Neuroscience research on the relation between empathy and psychopathy has predominately focused on the affective sharing and cognitive components of empathy in forensic populations, and much less on empathic concern. The current study used high-density electroencephalography in a community sample to examine the spatiotemporal neurodynamic responses when viewing people in physical distress under two subjective contexts: one evoking affective sharing, the other, empathic concern. Results indicate that early automatic (175-275 ms) and later controlled responses (LPP 400-1,000 ms) were differentially modulated by engagement in affective sharing or empathic concern. Importantly, the late event-related potentials (ERP) component was significantly impacted by dispositional empathy and psychopathy, but the early component was not. Individual differences in dispositional empathic concern directly predicted gamma coherence (25-40 Hz), whereas psychopathy was inversely modulatory. Interestingly, significant suppression in the mu/alpha band (8-13 Hz) when perceiving others in distress was positively associated with higher trait psychopathy, which argues against the assumption that sensorimotor resonance underpins empathy. Greater scores on trait psychopathy were inversely related to subjective ratings of both empathic concern and affective sharing. Overall, the study demonstrates that neural markers of affective sharing and empathic concern to the same cues of another's distress can be distinguished at an electrophysiological level, and that psychopathy alters later time-locked differentiations and spectral coherence associated with empathic concern.","D000987; D001921; D004569; D004644; D004645; D005071; D005260; D006801; D008297; D009483; D058748; D010556; D012938; D014796; D055815","Antisocial Personality Disorder; Brain; Electroencephalography; Emotions; Empathy; Evoked Potentials; Female; Humans; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Pain Perception; Personality Tests; Social Perception; Visual Perception; Young Adult","R01-MH-084934; R01-MH-087525","10.1080/17470919.2015.1029593",NA,"Jean Decety, Kimberly L Lewis, Jason M Cowell","Child Neurosuite, Department of Psychology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois; and."

This study aimed to gain in-depth understanding of day-to-day functioning in a rural Ethiopian setting and the functional impairments associated with SMD. A qualitative study was carried out in the Butajira area, south Ethiopia. In-depth interviews were conducted with people with SMD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;6), religious healers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2) and psychiatric nurses (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2). Four focus group discussions were carried out with caregivers of people with SMD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;37) and one with project outreach workers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5). A thematic analysis approach was used. Participants emphasized that functional impairment in people with SMD arose not only because of the symptoms associated with the illness, but also due to poverty, social exclusion and lack of social support. Within this rural community, the ability to work productively, engage in family life, maintain self-care and fulfill social obligations were the most highly valued domains of functioning. A wide range of farming tasks were elaborated in detail and noted to be of varying levels of difficulty. Although many people with symptomatic SMD were reported to be able to carry out simple farming tasks, this was distinguished from effective farming. Gender differences were most apparent in the domains of work and family life. Impaired functioning was reported to have a critical immediate impact on survival and longer-term impacts on the lifetime opportunities of people with SMD, their caregivers and the younger generation within the family. The study indicates that tackling social exclusion and poverty is needed alongside medical treatment through contextual community based rehabilitation programs. The gendering of functional roles and the complexity of work activities in this subsistence farming community lend support to arguments for locally contextualized measures of functioning in people with SMD.","D000203; D000328; D005002; D056344; D005260; D006801; D008297; D001523; D008875; D020380; D011569; D036301; D012424; D012648; D012944","Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Ethiopia; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Needs Assessment; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Qualitative Research; Rural Population; Self Care; Social Support","U19 MH095699; U19MH095699","10.1590/S1516-44462006000200014; 10.1093/schbul/sbm105; 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.090845; 10.4314/ajpsy.v12i3.48494; 10.1093/schbul/sbs130; 10.1017/S0264180100000904; 10.1192/bjp.178.6.506; 10.1186/1471-244X-14-150; 10.1186/1471-244X-11-165; 10.1192/bjp.191.50.s71; 10.1016/j.jad.2005.11.009; 10.1192/bjp.bp.105.013417; 10.1111/j.1399-5618.2007.00327.x; 10.1186/1745-0179-3-5; 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2007.01108.x; 10.1186/1477-7525-8-51; 10.1080/165019701750419545; 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69498-1; 10.1186/1471-2458-10-390; 10.1016/S0920-9964(00)90482-1; 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; 10.1016/j.ajp.2012.06.002; 10.1007/s00127-003-0691-7; 10.1016/j.schres.2005.05.028; 10.1034/j.1600-0447.2001.00059.x; 10.1093/schbul/sbl004; 10.1176/appi.ps.52.11.1485; 10.1176/ps.2006.57.8.1110; 10.1007/s00127-002-0580-5; 10.1192/bjp.bp.107.039107; 10.1093/oxfordjournals.schbul.a033400; 10.1007/s00127-004-0763-3; 10.1097/00005053-200209000-00009; 10.1080/01612840305301; 10.1007/s00127-003-0594-7; 10.1192/bjp.bp.108.057596; 10.1192/bjp.bp.112.118018; 10.1177/1363461512447070; 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2005.03545.x; 10.1017/S0033291704003551; 10.1007/s00127-003-0601-z",NA,"Kassahun Habtamu, Atalay Alem, Charlotte Hanlon","Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia."

A total of 113 new mothers with very low-birth-weight infants in their initial NICU admission were recruited from 2 urban hospitals servicing low-income minority communities. This study employed a cross-sectional design. Data were collected during the infants' postpartum NICU admission and included maternal demographic information (eg, age, education, race, living with the baby's father), infant illness severity (Neurobiologic Risk Score from infant's medical record), and maternal psychological measures (the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the Perinatal Posttraumatic Stress Questionnaire, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory). The findings indicated that 47 (42%) women had elevated postpartum depressive symptoms and 33 (30%) women had elevated postpartum posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSs). Factors associated with postpartum depressive symptoms included PTS, anxiety, maternal age, and whether the mother lived with the baby's father (F&#x2084;, &#x2081;&#x2080;&#x2084; = 52.27, P &lt; .001). The severity of the infants' illness, parental stress, and maternal education were not associated with depressive symptoms among low-income mothers of NICU infants. On the basis of our findings, we recommend that low-income women should be screened for symptoms of anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and postpartum depression on their infants' admission to the NICU. When this is not feasible, we advise NICU healthcare providers to assess women for familial support, maternal age, posttraumatic stress related to their infants birth, and anxiety to determine which mothers are at the greatest risk for postpartum depressive symptoms. Screening for postpartum depression in the NICU can aid in early identification and treatment, thereby decreasing negative consequences for mothers and their infants.","D000367; D003430; D019052; D005191; D005260; D006801; D007231; D019102; D007363; D009035; D011203; D011644; D012111; D012307; D012944; D013313; D014505","Age Factors; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression, Postpartum; Family Characteristics; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Very Low Birth Weight; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Mothers; Poverty; Puerperal Disorders; Residence Characteristics; Risk Factors; Social Support; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Urban Population","F31 NR010176; R01 NR009418; NR 010176; NR 09418","NA",NA,"Lindsey Garfield, Diane Holditch-Davis, C Sue Carter, Barbara L McFarlin, Dorie Schwertz, Julia S Seng, Carmen Giurgescu, Rosemary White-Traut","Women, Children, and Family Health Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago (Drs Garfield, McFarlin, and White-Traut); Research Affairs, Duke School of Nursing, Durham, North Carolina (Dr Holditch-Davis); Department of Psychiatry, Neuroscience, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (Dr Carter); Department of Biobehavioral Science, University of Illinois at Chicago (Dr Schwertz); Division of Health Promotion and Risk Reduction, University of Michigan School of Nursing, Ann Arbor (Dr Seng); College of Nursing, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan (Dr Giurgescu); and University of Illinois at Chicago, Nursing Research, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, and Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee (Dr White-Traut)."

However, whether low-income children benefit from living alongside more affluent neighbors is unknown. Prospectively gathered data on over 1,600 children from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study living in urban environments is used to test whether living alongside more affluent neighbors (measured via high-resolution geo-spatial indices) predicts low-income children's antisocial behavior (reported by mothers and teachers at the ages of 5, 7, 10, and 12). Results indicated that low-income boys (but not girls) surrounded by more affluent neighbors had higher levels of antisocial behavior than their peers embedded in concentrated poverty. The negative effect of growing up alongside more affluent neighbors on low-income boys' antisocial behavior held across childhood and after controlling for key neighborhood and family-level factors.

These circumstances increase their risk for academic failure and dropout. Given the academic and neural benefits associated with musicianship, music training may be one method for providing auditory enrichment to children from disadvantaged backgrounds. We followed a group of primary-school students from gang reduction zones in Los Angeles, CA, USA for 2 years as they participated in Harmony Project. By providing free community music instruction for disadvantaged children, Harmony Project promotes the healthy development of children as learners, the development of children as ambassadors of peace and understanding, and the development of stronger communities. Children who were more engaged in the music program-as defined by better attendance and classroom participation-developed stronger brain encoding of speech after 2 years than their less-engaged peers in the program. Additionally, children who were more engaged in the program showed increases in reading scores, while those less engaged did not show improvements. The neural gains accompanying music engagement were seen in the very measures of neural speech processing that are weaker in children from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Data were integrated from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study (2009-2010) for adults aged 18+ (n=4588, Mean age=43yr). Depressive symptoms were measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and diabetes status determined via self-report, usage of diabetic medication and/or fasting glucose levels &#x2265;126mg/dL and a glycated hemoglobin level &#x2265;6.5% (48mmol/mol). A 24-h dietary recall interview was given to determine intakes. Multiple logistic regression was employed, with depression the outcome, and dietary patterns and diabetes the predictors. Covariates included gender, age, marital status, education, race, adult food insecurity level, ratio of family income to poverty, and serum C-reactive protein. Exploratory factor analysis revealed five dietary patterns (healthy; unhealthy; sweets; 'Mexican' style; breakfast) explaining 39.8% of the total variance.

This study compared perinatal and sociodemographic risk factors between Brazil and Britain, and their role in explaining higher rates of conduct problems and violence in Brazil. Prospective population-based birth cohort studies were conducted in Pelotas, Brazil (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;3,618) and Avon, Britain (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;4,103). Eleven perinatal and sociodemographic risk factors were measured in questionnaires completed by mothers during the perinatal period. Conduct problems were measured in questionnaires completed by mothers at age 11, and violence in self-report questionnaires completed by adolescents at age 18. Conduct problems were predicted by similar risk factors in Brazil and Britain. Female violence was predicted by several of the same risk factors in both countries. However, male violence in Brazil was associated with only one risk factor, and several risk factor associations were weaker in Brazil than in Britain for both females and males. Almost 20% of the higher risk for conduct problems in Brazil compared to Britain was explained by differential exposure to risk factors. The percentage of the cross-national difference in violence explained by early risk factors was 15% for females and 8% for males. A nontrivial proportion of cross-national differences in antisocial behaviour are related to perinatal and sociodemographic conditions at the start of life.

We examined a sample of 11,329 adults (&#x2265;18 years) who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) during the years 2005-2008. Insomnia was classified via a combination of self-reported positive physician diagnosis and high-frequency 'trouble falling asleep', 'waking during the night', 'waking too early', and 'feeling unrested during the day'. OSA was classified as a combination of a positive response to a physician-diagnosed condition, in addition to a high frequency of self-reported nocturnal 'snoring', 'snorting/stopping breathing' and 'feeling overly sleepy during the day'. Comorbid insomnia-OSA was further assessed by combining a positive response to either insomnia (all), or sleep apnoea (all), as classified above. Depressive symptomology was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), with scores of &gt;9 used to indicate depression. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for sleep disorders and depression were attained from logistic regression modelling adjusted for sex, age, poverty level, smoking status and body mass index (BMI).

Data was gathered from 361 low-income mothers (many with psychiatric diagnoses) reporting on their parenting behavior, parenting stress, and their child's adjustment, in a 2-wave longitudinal study over 5 years. Measurement models were developed to derive 4 broad parenting constructs (involvement, control, rejection, and stress) and 3 child adjustment constructs (internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and social competence). After measurement invariance of these constructs was confirmed across relevant groups and over time, both measurement models were integrated in a single crossed-lagged regression analysis of latent constructs. Multiple reciprocal influences were observed between parenting and perceived child adjustment over time: Externalizing and internalizing problems in children were predicted by baseline maternal parenting behaviors, and child social competence was found to reduce parental stress and increase parental involvement and appropriate monitoring. These findings on the motherhood experience are discussed in light of recent research efforts to understand mother-child bidirectional influences and their potential for practical applications.","D000293; D000328; D002648; D002652; D005260; D006801; D008137; D008297; D033261; D008875; D009035; D016487; D011203; D012917; D066107; D013997; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child Behavior; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Maternal-Fetal Relations; Middle Aged; Mothers; Parenting; Poverty; Social Adjustment; Social Skills; Time Factors; Young Adult","R01-DA11498; DA010726; R01-DA14385; R01 DA010726; R01 DA014385","10.1207/s15374424jccp2104_12; 10.1037/a0021081; 10.2307/352928; 10.1177/0743558401164003; 10.1037/a0028193; 10.1016/j.appdev.2014.04.003; 10.1080/14616734.2013.804328; 10.1007/978-1-4614-0905-2; 10.1007/s10862-012-9331-4; 10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.01114.x; 10.1037/0033-2909.105.3.456; 10.1207/s15374424jccp3501_4; 10.1007/s10896-009-9222-y; 10.1037/1040-3590.18.2.209; 10.1016/S0022-4405(02)00090-0; 10.1037/a0025254; 10.1002/da.20522; 10.1177/0146621611432863; 10.1007/s10964-007-9216-0; 10.1111/1467-8624.7402017; 10.1097/CHI.0b013e3181640805; 10.1037/a0015665; 10.1016/j.dr.2011.08.001; 10.1111/j.1741-3737.2002.00054.x; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01652.x; 10.1207/s15374424jccp1904_3; 10.1037/10409-007; 10.1525/eth.2005.33.3.299; 10.1016/0022-4405(95)00003-5; 10.1016/j.jsat.2006.07.002; 10.1097/00004583-199209000-00022; 10.1207/s15374424jccp1904_2; 10.1136/jech.2004.021808; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01523.x",NA,"Baptiste Barbot, Elizabeth Crossman, Scott R Hunter, Elena L Grigorenko, Suniya S Luthar","Child Study Center, Yale University."

Differences can be explained by methodological problems, premature mortality, seizure remission, socioeconomic factors, and stigma. Diagnostic misclassification-one possible explanation-may result from inclusion of patients with acute symptomatic or isolated unprovoked seizures. Other sources of bias include age and ethnic origin of the target population, definitions of epilepsy, retrospective versus prospective ascertainment, sources of cases, and experienced and perceived stigma. Premature mortality is an issue in low-income countries (LICs), where treatment gap, brain infections, and traumatic brain injuries are more common than in high-income countries (HICs). Death rates may reflect untreated continued seizures or inclusion of acute symptomatic seizures. Lack of compliance with antiepileptic drugs has been associated with increased risk for death, increased hospital admissions, motor vehicle accidents, and fractures in poor communities. Epilepsy is a self-remitting clinical condition in up to 50% of cases. Studies in untreated individuals from LICs have shown that the proportion of remissions overlaps that of countries where patients receive treatment. When the identification of patients is based on spontaneous reports (e.g., door-to-door surveys), patients in remission may be less likely to disclose the disease for fear of stigmatization with no concurrent benefits. This might lead to underascertainment of cases when assessing the lifetime prevalence of epilepsy. In LICs, the proportion of people living in poverty is greater than in HICs. Poverty is associated with risk factors for epilepsy, risk for developing epilepsy, and increased mortality. The high incidence and prevalence of epilepsy found in LICs is also observed in low income individuals from HICs. Epileptogenic conditions are associated with an increased mortality. This may partly explain the difference between incidence and lifetime prevalence of epilepsy in LICs. Poverty within LICs and HICs could be a preventable cause of mortality in epilepsy.","D003906; D004827; D006801; D007182; D011203; D015995; D012959","Developing Countries; Epilepsy; Humans; Income; Poverty; Prevalence; Socioeconomic Factors",NA,"NA",NA,"Ettore Beghi, Dale Hesdorffer","Department of Neurosciences, IRCCS Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research, Milano, Italy."

Thus, we assessed the association between SES and hypertension in rural populations of LMICs. Further, we explored whether this association differs according to geographical region. Through a search of databases we identified population-based studies that presented risk estimates for the association between SES, or any of its proxies, and hypertension. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random effects model. Overall, no association was detected between educational status and hypertension, whereas a positive association was observed with income. Interestingly, educational status was inversely associated with hypertension in East Asia {effect size [ES] 0.82 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78, 0.87]} but positively associated in South Asia [ES 1.28 (95% CI 1.14, 1.43)]. Higher income, household assets or social class were positively associated with hypertension in South Asia whereas no association was detected in East Asia and Africa. Compared with other occupations, farmers or manual labourers were associated with a lower risk for hypertension. Further, in regions such as Latin America, few studies were identified that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. We provide evidence that the association between hypertension and SES in rural populations of LMICs in Asia varies according to geographical region.

Most behavioral investigations in experimental parkinsonism have employed short-term observation windows to assess motor impairments. We postulated that an analysis of longer-term free exploratory behavior could provide further insights into the complex fine structure of altered locomotor activity in parkinsonian animals. To this end, we video-monitored 23 h of free locomotor behavior and extracted several behavioral measures before and after the expression of a severe parkinsonian phenotype following bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the rat dopaminergic substantia nigra. Unbiased stereological cell counting verified the degree of midbrain tyrosine hydroxylase positive cell loss in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. In line with previous reports, overall covered distance and maximal motion speed of lesioned animals were found to be significantly reduced compared to controls. Before lesion surgery, exploratory rat behavior exhibited a bimodal distribution of maximal speed values obtained for single movement episodes, corresponding to a ""first"" and ""second gear"" of motion. 6-OHDA injections significantly reduced the incidence of second gear motion episodes and also resulted in an abnormal prolongation of these fast motion events. Likewise, the spatial spread of such episodes was increased in 6-OHDA rats. The increase in curvature of motion tracks was increased in both lesioned and control animals. We conclude that the discrimination of distinct modes of motion by statistical decomposition of longer-term spontaneous locomotion provides useful insights into the fine structure of fluctuating motor functions in a rat analog of Parkinson's disease.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.expneurol.2009.11.016; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2583-07.2007; 10.2307/2346101; 10.1126/science.2402638; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0943-12.2012; 10.1016/j.brainres.2004.12.009; 10.1038/nrn877; 10.1007/s00221-008-1656-6; 10.1016/S0165-0270(99)00194-6; 10.1016/S0149-7634(01)00022-7; 10.1016/S0166-4328(01)00290-X; 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2005.04.005; 10.1016/0014-4886(92)90038-R; 10.1016/S0006-8993(00)03270-4; 10.1111/j.1365-2818.1986.tb02764.x; 10.1111/j.1365-2818.1987.tb02837.x; 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2012.07.013; 10.1038/334345a0; 10.1016/0006-8993(75)90253-X; 10.1093/brain/95.3.475; 10.1016/j.expneurol.2011.08.003; 10.1006/exnr.1997.6418; 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2005.04238.x; 10.1038/nrn2915; 10.1016/0006-8993(94)91533-4; 10.1126/science.564552; 10.1016/S0301-0082(96)00015-9; 10.1016/S0301-0082(96)00040-8; 10.1016/j.mri.2007.10.010; 10.1016/j.expneurol.2008.02.006; 10.1093/brain/awq032; 10.1016/j.bbr.2005.11.026; 10.1016/j.expneurol.2012.08.018; 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2012.01.029; 10.1016/S0079-6123(02)35006-4; 10.1002/ar.1092310411; 10.1016/j.expneurol.2013.01.014",NA,"Benjamin Grieb, Constantin von Nicolai, Gerhard Engler, Andrew Sharott, Ismini Papageorgiou, Wolfgang Hamel, Andreas K Engel, Christian K Moll","Department of Neurophysiology and Pathophysiology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, University of Hamburg Hamburg, Germany."

Socioeconomically disadvantaged children are underexposed to linguistically and cognitively stimulating environments and overexposed to environmental toxins, including noise pollution. This kind of sensory impoverishment, we theorize, has extensive repercussions on how the brain processes sound. To characterize how this impoverishment affects auditory brain function, we compared two groups of normal-hearing human adolescents who attended the same schools and who were matched in age, sex, and ethnicity, but differed in their maternal education level, a correlate of socioeconomic status (SES). In addition to lower literacy levels and cognitive abilities, adolescents from lower maternal education backgrounds were found to have noisier neural activity than their classmates, as reflected by greater activity in the absence of auditory stimulation. Additionally, in the lower maternal education group, the neural response to speech was more erratic over repeated stimulation, with lower fidelity to the input signal. These weaker, more variable, and noisier responses are suggestive of an inefficient auditory system. By studying SES within a neuroscientific framework, we have the potential to expand our understanding of how experience molds the brain, in addition to informing intervention research aimed at closing the achievement gap between high-SES and low-SES children.","D000161; D000293; D001307; D001309; D001921; D004522; D005260; D006801; D008297; D008425; D012923; D012931; D013067","Acoustic Stimulation; Adolescent; Auditory Perception; Auditory Threshold; Brain; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Male; Maternal Behavior; Social Class; Social Environment; Speech Perception",NA,"10.1016/j.tics.2007.08.015; 10.1016/j.heares.2008.08.004; 10.1542/peds.113.4.846; 10.1073/pnas.1213555110; 10.1121/1.4799804; 10.1093/cercor/bhp024; 10.1038/228477a0; 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233; 10.1177/001391657500700406; 10.2307/1602387; 10.2307/1131822; 10.1007/s10162-010-0236-1; 10.1073/pnas.1309518110; 10.1093/cercor/bht028; 10.1126/science.1082163; 10.1016/S0022-1031(73)80005-8; 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01651.x; 10.1037/0894-4105.22.3.293; 10.1007/s10643-011-0491-8; 10.3109/00016489709117760; 10.1037/0003-066X.59.2.77; 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.23.112001.112349; 10.1073/pnas.0811910106; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1995.tb00522.x; 10.1121/1.381985; 10.2307/3653456; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2009.01380.x; 10.1093/aler/ahl003; 10.1016/j.jenvp.2006.04.001; 10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.003; 10.1038/nrn2897; 10.1371/journal.pone.0018712; 10.1016/j.bbr.2013.01.007; 10.2105/AJPH.2007.133215; 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103538; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4205-12.2013; 10.1073/pnas.0901123106; 10.1073/pnas.1206628109; 10.1038/415073a; 10.1111/1467-9280.00483; 10.1371/journal.pone.0042486; 10.1348/000709909X475055; 10.1162/jocn.2009.21101; 10.1016/j.envres.2005.09.008; 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2007.07.021; 10.1038/nrn2882; 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2012.06463.x; 10.1016/j.cogbrainres.2005.05.004; 10.1016/j.clinph.2011.07.037; 10.1073/pnas.1201575109; 10.1073/pnas.1532872100; 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4985-05.2006; 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00238; 10.1044/1092-4388(2007/067); 10.1017/S0954579408000412; 10.1001/archpsyc.57.11.1077; 10.1093/bmb/63.1.171; 10.1016/j.heares.2012.12.008; 10.1073/pnas.1304437110; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2005.00394.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00600.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2012.01147.x; 10.1016/S0378-5955(03)00225-9; 10.1016/S0013-4694(97)95213-9; 10.1542/peds.99.3.318; 10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00142; 10.1097/AUD.0b013e318241e880; 10.1016/0006-8993(92)91243-8; 10.1037/a0013917; 10.3389/neuro.09.003.2010; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.01.021; 10.1542/peds.102.2.346; 10.1126/science.1167025; 10.1016/0006-8993(75)90748-9; 10.1126/science.6612332; 10.1016/j.neuron.2011.12.005; 10.1016/S0378-5955(03)00074-1; 10.1371/journal.pone.0035744; 10.1007/s12070-011-0163-4; 10.1016/S0031-3955(05)70077-8; 10.1097/AUD.0b013e3181cdb272; 10.1093/cercor/bhr196; 10.1038/nrn1668; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00807.x; 10.1093/cercor/bht103; 10.1121/1.385431; 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2004.03.011; 10.1046/j.0956-7976.2003.psci_1475.x; 10.1073/pnas.261707398; 10.1038/ncomms1849",NA,"Erika Skoe, Jennifer Krizman, Nina Kraus","Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory, Bilingualism and Psycholinguistics Research Group, Department of Communication Sciences, Institute for Neuroscience, Department of Neurobiology and Physiology, and Department of Otolaryngology, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208."

CART analysis proved moderately effective overall, with agreement of 60%, sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 53%.

All biological siblings were identified in the sample (N = 179 099). Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the effect of neighbourhood deprivation on violent criminality and substance misuse between the ages of 15 and 20 years, while taking into account the cross-classified data structure (i.e. siblings in the same families attending different schools and living in different neighbourhoods at age 15). In the crude model, an increase of 1 SD in neighbourhood deprivation was associated with a 57% increase in the odds of being convicted of a violent crime (95% CI 52%-63%). The effect was greatly attenuated when adjustment was made for a number of observed confounders (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.06-1.11). When we additionally adjusted for unobserved familial confounders, the effect was no longer present (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84-1.10). Similar results were observed for substance misuse. The results were not due to poor variability either between neighbourhoods or within families.

The two approaches have considerably different implications for how human wellbeing might be improved. Research in psychology, prevention science, and neuroscience is converging on an evolutionary account of the importance of two contrasting suites of social behavior-prosociality vs. antisocial behaviors (crime, drug abuse, risky sexual behavior) and related problems such as depression. Prosociality of individuals and groups evolves in environments that minimize toxic biological and social conditions, promote and richly reinforce prosocial behavior and attitudes, limit opportunities for antisocial behavior, and nurture the pursuit of prosocial values. Conversely, antisocial behavior and related problems emerge in environments that are high in threat and conflict. Over the past 30 years, randomized trials have shown numerous family, school, and community interventions to prevent most problem behaviors and promote prosociality. Research has also shown that poverty and economic inequality are major risk factors for the development of problem behaviors. The paper describes policies that can reduce poverty and benefit youth development. Although it is clear that the canonical economic model of rational self-interest has made a significant contribution to the science of economics, the evidence reviewed here shows that it must be reconciled with an evolutionary perspective on human development and wellbeing if society is going to evolve public policies that advance the health and wellbeing of the entire population.",NA,NA,"R01 HD060922; RC2 DA028946","NA",NA,"Anthony Biglan, Christine Cody","Oregon Research Institute."

Some of the ethical issues in managing somatization include being influenced by patient distress rather than rational medical decision-making, inadequate attention to the cultural meaning of symptoms, psychologizing versus medicalizing, the ethics of nomenclature and labels, communicating ethically with patients, and managing them adequately given lack of evidence and training. An ethical approach to managing somatization in this context would include using an integrated and simultaneous medical and psychiatric approach. To ensure patient beneficence, the medical, psychological and social assessment should be undertaken side-by-side as much as possible and should be cost effective. Respecting patient autonomy by using adequate communication methods and the patient's cultural model of the illness as part of management is also integral to ethical practice.

We examined the prevalence of child physical and sexual abuse and the associations of child abuse with early contextual, family, and individual factors using a community-based sample in Ontario. The Ontario Child Health Study is a province-wide health survey of children aged 4 through 16 years. Conducted in 1983, a second wave was undertaken in 1987 and a third in 2000-2001. The third wave (N=1,928) included questions about exposure to physical and sexual abuse in childhood. Males reported significantly more child physical abuse (33.7%), but not severe physical abuse (21.5%), than females (28.2% and 18.3%, respectively). Females reported significantly more child sexual abuse (22.1%) than males (8.3%). Growing up in an urban area, young maternal age at the time of the first child's birth, and living in poverty, predicted child physical abuse (and the severe category), and sexual abuse. Childhood psychiatric disorder was associated with child physical abuse (and the severe category), while parental adversity was associated with child sexual abuse and severe physical abuse. Siblings of those who experienced either physical abuse or sexual abuse in childhood were at increased risk for the same abuse exposure; the risk was highest for physical abuse. These findings highlight important similarities and differences in risk factors for physical and sexual abuse in childhood. Such information is useful in considering approaches to prevention and early detection of child maltreatment. Clinicians who identify physical abuse or sexual abuse in children should be alert to the need to assess whether siblings have experienced similar exposures. This has important implications for assessment of other children in the home at the time of identification with the overall goal of reducing further occurrence of abuse.","D000293; D000328; D000367; D002648; D002649; D002650; D002675; D005260; D006801; D008297; D008423; D001523; D009864; D011203; D015995; D012111; D012189; D012307; D055815","Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Child; Child Abuse; Child Abuse, Sexual; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Male; Maternal Age; Mental Disorders; Ontario; Poverty; Prevalence; Residence Characteristics; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Young Adult",NA,"NA",NA,"Harriet L MacMillan, Masako Tanaka, Eric Duku, Tracy Vaillancourt, Michael H Boyle","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada L8S 4K1."

Given that neurologists and neurosurgeons have special expertise in this area, the authors hypothesized that the density of neuroscience providers is associated with reduced mortality rates from stroke across US counties. This is a retrospective review of the Area Resource File 2009-2010, a national county-level health information database maintained by the US Department of Health and Human Services. The primary outcome variable was the 3-year (2004-2006) average in cerebrovascular disease deaths per million population for each county. The primary independent variable was the combined density of neurosurgeons and neurologists per million population in the year 2006. Multiple regression analysis was performed, adjusting for density of general practitioners (GPs), urbanicity of the county, and socioeconomic status of the residents of the county. In the 3141 counties analyzed, the median number of annual stroke deaths was 586 (interquartile range [IQR] 449-754), the median number of neuroscience providers was 0 (IQR 0-26), and the median number of GPs was 274 (IQR 175-410) per million population. On multivariate adjusted analysis, each increase of 1 neuroscience provider was associated with 0.38 fewer deaths from stroke per year (p &lt; 0.001) per million population. Rural location (p &lt; 0.001) and increased density of GPs (p &lt; 0.001) were associated with increases in stroke-related mortality.

We review challenges rooted in the implicit and explicit assumptions informing this newborn field. We provide balanced theoretical alternatives on how hypothesized psychological processes map onto the brain (e.g., problem of localization) and how experimental phenomena at multiple levels of analysis (e.g., behavior, cognition and the brain) could be related. We therefore examine unclear issues regarding the existing perspectives on poverty and their relationships with low SES, the evidence of low-SES adaptive functioning, historical precedents of the ""alternate pathways"" (neuroplasticity) interpretation of learning disabilities related to low-SES and the notion of deficit, issues of ""normativity"" and validity in findings of neurocognitive differences between children from different SES, and finally alternative interpretations of the complex relationship between IQ and SES. Particularly, we examine the extent to which the available laboratory results may be interpreted as showing that cognitive performance in low-SES children reflects cognitive and behavioral deficits as a result of growing up in specific environmental or cultural contexts, and how the experimental findings should be interpreted for the design of different types of interventions-particularly those related to educational practices-or translated to the public-especially the media. Although a cautionary tone permeates many studies, still, a potential deficit attribution-i.e., low-SES is associated with cognitive and behavioral developmental deficits-seems almost an inevitable implicit issue with ethical implications.

This converging, multidisciplinary science of human development has profound implications for our ability to enhance the life prospects of children and to strengthen the social and economic fabric of society. Drawing on these multiple streams of investigation, this report presents an ecobiodevelopmental framework that illustrates how early experiences and environmental influences can leave a lasting signature on the genetic predispositions that affect emerging brain architecture and long-term health. The report also examines extensive evidence of the disruptive impacts of toxic stress, offering intriguing insights into causal mechanisms that link early adversity to later impairments in learning, behavior, and both physical and mental well-being. The implications of this framework for the practice of medicine, in general, and pediatrics, specifically, are potentially transformational. They suggest that many adult diseases should be viewed as developmental disorders that begin early in life and that persistent health disparities associated with poverty, discrimination, or maltreatment could be reduced by the alleviation of toxic stress in childhood. An ecobiodevelopmental framework also underscores the need for new thinking about the focus and boundaries of pediatric practice. It calls for pediatricians to serve as both front-line guardians of healthy child development and strategically positioned, community leaders to inform new science-based strategies that build strong foundations for educational achievement, economic productivity, responsible citizenship, and lifelong health.","D000328; D001921; D002657; D002669; D002675; D006293; D006801; D010372; D010819; D002666; D012931; D013315","Adult; Brain; Child Development; Child Welfare; Child, Preschool; Health Promotion; Humans; Pediatrics; Physician's Role; Psychology, Child; Social Environment; Stress, Psychological",NA,"NA",NA,"Jack P Shonkoff, Andrew S Garner",NA

The result is poverty of movement, increased muscle rigidity, and tremor at rest and on posture. Midbrain/nigral structural abnormalities can be demonstrated in vivo with both transcranial sonography (TCS) and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) while positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) ligands exist to demonstrate dopamine terminal dysfunction. These radiotracers are markers of dopamine storage capacity, vesicular monoamine and dopamine transporter availability. While loss of putamen dopaminergic function leads to motor disability, Lewy bodies not only target dopamine neurons but have also been observed in serotoninergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic neurons. As a consequence, non-dopaminergic neurotransmission is also impaired resulting in non-motor symptoms including sleep disturbance, fatigue, depression, dementia, and autonomic dysfunction. PET and SPECT ligands exist to interrogate the function of monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons. Cortical and limbic Lewy body disease is seen in more advanced PD and this can be detected with FDG PET as abnormal covariance between levels of resting brain metabolism in these regions.

Gender differences were found in several subscales of the SDQ; girls had more emotional problems, whereas boys had higher scores regarding peer relationship and hyperactivity/inattention problems. Male gender, low socioeconomic status (family income below poverty limit and living in a single parent home), and other chronic disease (asthma/diabetes) were independent risk factors of developing psychiatric symptoms, along with epilepsy.

This article reviews and updates the evidence base informing that recommendation and explores federal and state policy challenges involved in implementing it. Reviews of published research, analyses of federal child health data sets, consultation with early development and state and local program experts, and site visits were conducted between 2006 and 2009, with statistics and literature reviews updated through mid-2010. The economic and social conditions of children's lives, especially in the early years, affect their health and development in childhood and across the life course. Forty percent of children in the U.S. live in families with incomes &lt;200% of the federal poverty level and consequently are at higher risk of poor health and development. Recent advances in neuroscience and life course epidemiology reveal that these children are more likely to experience chronic or ""toxic"" stress resulting from frequent or sustained adverse experiences, increasing their lifetime risk of chronic disease. Intervening early in childhood by providing a safe, stable, nurturing, and stimulating environment can improve cognitive, emotional, and behavioral development and health outcomes in children--particularly socially and economically disadvantaged children--and both their health and social and economic well-being as adults. Coordination of multiple programs and funding sources, along with higher standards of accountability for services, outcomes, and ongoing evaluation of effectiveness, are needed to ensure more effective state and local programs providing early developmental support. Federal leadership and funding are needed to ensure that children at high risk for multiple adverse exposures and their families receive attention and services as early as possible.","D000293; D000328; D002648; D002654; D002669; D002675; D018479; D004777; D005190; D005378; D054624; D006801; D007223; D011203; D011640; D012944; D014481","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child Care; Child Welfare; Child, Preschool; Early Intervention, Educational; Environment; Family; Financial Support; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Infant; Poverty; Public Policy; Social Support; United States",NA,"NA",NA,"Wilhelmine D Miller, Tabashir Sadegh-Nobari, Marsha Lillie-Blanton","NORC at University of Chicago, Bethesda, Maryland 20814, USA."

A prospective observational study followed Latinas from pregnancy through 13 months postpartum. Prenatal predictors of PPD included depression, recent IPV exposure, remote IPV exposure, non-IPV trauma history, poverty, low social support, acculturation, high parity, and low education. Postpartum depression was measured at 3, 7, and 13 months after birth with the Beck's Depression Inventory-Fast Screen. Strength of association was evaluated using bivariate and multivariable odds ratio analysis. Subjects were predominantly low income, monolingual Spanish, and foreign-born, with mean age of 27.7. Recent IPV, prenatal depression, non-IPV trauma, and low social support were associated with greater likelihood of PPD in bivariate analyses.

A perspective from behavioral ecology.","Within affluent populations, there are marked socioeconomic gradients in health behavior, with people of lower socioeconomic position smoking more, exercising less, having poorer diets, complying less well with therapy, using medical services less, ignoring health and safety advice more, and being less health-conscious overall, than their more affluent peers. Whilst the proximate mechanisms underlying these behavioral differences have been investigated, the ultimate causes have not. This paper presents a theoretical model of why socioeconomic gradients in health behavior might be found. I conjecture that lower socioeconomic position is associated with greater exposure to extrinsic mortality risks (that is, risks that cannot be mitigated through behavior), and that health behavior competes for people's time and energy against other activities which contribute to their fitness. Under these two assumptions, the model shows that the optimal amount of health behavior to perform is indeed less for people of lower socioeconomic position. The model predicts an exacerbatory dynamic of poverty, whereby the greater exposure of poor people to unavoidable harms engenders a disinvestment in health behavior, resulting in a final inequality in health outcomes which is greater than the initial inequality in material conditions. I discuss the assumptions of the model, and its implications for strategies for the reduction of health inequalities.","D015438; D006801; D008962; D011203; D012959","Health Behavior; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Poverty; Socioeconomic Factors",NA,"NA","<b>Competing Interests: </b>The author has declared that no competing interests exist.","Daniel Nettle","Centre for Behaviour and Evolution, Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University, Newcastle, United Kingdom."

We studied the development of differences in reproductive schedules, using a cross-sectional survey over 1000 school students aged 9-15 in the metropolitan borough of North Tyneside. Students from more deprived neighbourhoods had earlier ideal ages for parenthood than those from more affluent ones, and these differences were fully apparent by age 11. We found evidence consistent with three mechanisms playing a role in maintaining the socioeconomic gradient. These were: vertical intergenerational transmission (students whose own parents were younger at their birth wanted children younger); oblique intergenerational transmission (students in neighbourhoods where parents were younger in general wanted children earlier); and low parental investment (students who did not feel emotionally supported by their own parents wanted children at a younger age). Our results shed some light on the proximate factors which may be involved in maintaining early childbearing in disadvantaged communities. They help understand why educational initiatives aimed at adolescents tend to have no effect, whereas improving the well-being of poor families with young children may do so.

In Spain, following the intellectual poverty of the absolutist rule of King Ferdinand, medicine took on a new flourishing lease of life in the last third of the century under the leadership of its most distinguished proponent, Santiago Ramon y Cajal. In April 1903, and in spite of the country's multiple political and social ups and downs, Madrid organised a great medical convention (14th International Congress of Medicine) that gathered together the foremost figures in the neurosciences. This work attempts to describe the situation in which neurology found itself at that time, as well as the socio-political context, and to highlight the most important contributions that were made in our specialty. A whole medical generation from around the world enthusiastically took part and 1681 communications and papers were presented, many of which dealt with neurological topics. Special mention should be made of the presentations by Cajal, who described the histological structure of the optic thalamus, and by Pavlov, who gave details of his theory of conditioned reflexes for the very first time.","D003226; D049672; D049673; D038622; D009488; D013030","Congresses as Topic; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Internationality; Neurosciences; Spain",NA,"NA",NA,"Esteban Garc&#xed;a-Albea Ristol, Julia Garc&#xed;a-Albea Mart&#xed;n","Secci&#xf3;n de Neurolog&#xed;a, Hospital Universitario Pr&#xed;ncipe de Asturias, Madrid, Espa&#xf1;a."

This review aims to highlight these questions, to outline their potential significance, and to suggest routes by which they might be approached. Although remarkably few neural studies have been carried out so far, there exists a large literature of previous behavioural work. This behavioural research provides an invaluable guide for future neuroimaging work, but also poses an important challenge for it: how can we ensure that the neural data contributes predictive or diagnostic power over and above what can be derived from behaviour alone? We discuss some of the open mechanistic questions which Cognitive Neuroscience may have the power to illuminate, spanning areas including language, numerical cognition, stress, memory, and social influences on learning. These questions have obvious practical and societal significance, but they also bear directly on a set of longstanding questions in basic science: what are the environmental and neural factors which affect the acquisition and retention of declarative and nondeclarative skills? Perhaps the best opportunity for practical and theoretical interests to converge is in the study of interventions. Many interventions aimed at improving the cognitive development of low SES children are currently underway, but almost all are operating without either input from, or study by, the Cognitive Neuroscience community. Given that longitudinal intervention studies are very hard to set up, but can, with proper designs, be ideal tests of causal mechanisms, this area promises exciting opportunities for future research.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3102/00346543075001001; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2008.03.001; 10.1016/j.econedurev.2005.10.007; 10.1038/4551057a; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01021.x; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.00995.x; 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.00834.x; 10.2307/1130253; 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233; 10.1111/1467-8624.t01-1-00383; 10.3389/neuro.09.032.2009; 10.1111/1467-8624.00457; 10.1037/0012-1649.37.2.231; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2008.03.003; 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01622.x; 10.1126/science.1128317; 10.1126/science.1170769; 10.1146/annurev.psych.58.110405.085551; 10.2307/146372; 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2006.12.017; 10.1037/0894-4105.22.3.293; 10.1126/science.1151148; 10.1161/01.STR.0000221281.69373.4e; 10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.1087; 10.1080/00223890802634290; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01641.x; 10.2307/1131385; 10.1038/scientificamericanmind1207-36; 10.1111/1467-8624.00330; 10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190057; 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.02008.x; 10.1073/pnas.0811910106; 10.1016/j.brainres.2006.06.072; 10.1162/003465304323031049; 10.1126/science.1171999; 10.1093/cercor/bhk001; 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60032-4; 10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70267-3; 10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.003; 10.1126/science.1128898; 10.1002/(SICI)1099-0720(199704)11:2&lt;113::AID-ACP424&gt;3.0.CO;2-F; 10.1177/0009922806297303; 10.1037/0735-7044.121.3.602; 10.1111/1467-8624.00612; 10.1146/annurev.psych.093008.100442; 10.1016/S0010-0285(02)00500-5; 10.1016/1041-6080(94)90003-5; 10.1002/ddrr.46; 10.1162/jocn.2009.21101; 10.1073/pnas.0600888103; 10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2007.02.019; 10.1016/S0006-3223(00)00965-3; 10.1017/S0954579401003133; 10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.02.031; 10.1038/sj.npp.1301544; 10.1037/0003-066X.53.2.185; 10.1126/science.1158808; 10.1126/science.159.3810.56; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00746.x; 10.2105/AJPH.2008.148353; 10.1037/0003-066X.61.2.99; 10.1037/0012-1649.44.4.895; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00600.x; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2005.00394.x; 10.1353/foc.2005.0006; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00542.x; 10.1016/S0193-953X(02)00112-0; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.01.021; 10.1093/cercor/bhp076; 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01131.x; 10.1037/0003-066X.53.2.109; 10.1006/pmed.1998.0279; 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.07.003; 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.3.022806.091411; 10.1001/archpedi.161.8.730; 10.1001/jama.285.18.2339; 10.1007/s11881-003-0004-6; 10.2307/748203; 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093633; 10.1016/S0006-3223(02)01836-X; 10.1176/appi.ajp.163.4.735; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00714.x; 10.1598/RRQ.21.4.1; 10.1016/j.ecresq.2004.01.002; 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00807.x; 10.1007/s004269900007; 10.1073/pnas.0030098100; 10.1046/j.0956-7976.2003.psci_1475.x; 10.1006/pmed.1998.0280; 10.1162/jocn.2008.20040",NA,"Rajeev D S Raizada, Mark M Kishiyama","Neukom Institute for Computational Science, Dartmouth College Hanover, NH, USA."

The prevalence of psychological distress in connection with attendance at the traditional healers' shrines was 65.1%. Having a co-wife and having more than four children were significantly associated with psyclogical distress. Among the socioeconomic indicators, lack of food and having debts were significantly associated with psychological distress. The distressed group was more likely to need explanations for ill health. Those who visited both the healer and a health unit were less likely to be distressed.

This review surveys visual HSN, presenting first the means for detection and diagnosis in its manifold variations.

The literature review revealed a number of ethical dilemmas and challenges that professionals, cancer patients and their families encountered during palliative care. It was noted that patients' preferences and decisions are influenced by family members. Dilemmas leave the professionals and families confused about how ethical their actions have been. Specific ethical issues were noted in relation to the availability and use of oral morphine for pain relief, spiritual care, lack of adequate palliative care services, and palliative care education.

In the present research, we report on the development of a theoretically grounded, generally applicable, and patient report measure of provider cultural competency. Samples of predominantly African American patients (N=310) were recruited from three urban medical clinics to complete a survey about their relationship with their physician. We examined the factor structure, validity and other psychometric characteristics of a newly proposed patient report measure of provider cultural competency. Psychometric analyses supported a tripartite model of cultural competency that was comprised of patient judgments of their physician's cultural knowledge, awareness, and skill. In addition, this result was replicated across multiple clinical contexts, while also demonstrating convergent and incremental validity when correlated with measures of trust, satisfaction and discrimination. This newly proposed measure addresses prior limitations in cultural competency measurement and may enhance future research by providing a standardized tool for use in multiple clinical and cultural contexts.","D000293; D000328; D000554; D001249; D044383; D002648; D002662; D003142; D003155; D054521; D005260; D054625; D006801; D007600; D008297; D008824; D008875; D017060; D010817; D011204; D011618; D011795; D014505","Adolescent; Adult; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Asthma; Black People; Child; Child Health Services; Communication; Community Mental Health Centers; Cultural Competency; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Judgment; Male; Michigan; Middle Aged; Patient Satisfaction; Physician-Patient Relations; Poverty Areas; Psychotic Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urban Population",NA,"NA",NA,"Todd Lucas, Georgia Michalopoulou, Pamela Falzarano, Shanti Menon, Windy Cunningham","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Institute of Mental Health, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI 48201, USA."

The degeneration of nigrostriatal DA neurons in Parkinson's disease causes poverty and slowness of movement. These symptoms are greatly improved by pharmacological DA replacement with L-3,4-dihydroxy-phenylalanine (L-DOPA), which however causes excessive involuntary movements in a majority of patients. L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (abnormal involuntary movements) provides a topic of investigation at the interface between clinical and basic neuroscience. In this article, we review recent studies in rodent models, which have uncovered two principal alterations at the basis of the movement disorder, namely, an abnormal pre-synaptic handling of exogenous L-DOPA, and a hyper-reactive post-synaptic response to DA. Dysregulated nigrostriatal DA transmission causes secondary alterations in a variety of non-dopaminergic transmitter systems, the manipulation of which modulates dyskinesia through mechanisms that are presently unclear. Further research on L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia will contribute to a deeper understanding of the functional interplay between neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in the motor circuits of the basal ganglia.","D000818; D000978; D004195; D004298; D004409; D006801; D007980; D008959; D009434; D009435","Animals; Antiparkinson Agents; Disease Models, Animal; Dopamine; Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced; Humans; Levodopa; Models, Neurological; Neural Pathways; Synaptic Transmission",NA,"NA",NA,"M A Cenci, H S Lindgren","Basal Ganglia Pathophysiology Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, S-221 84 Lund, Sweden."

Birth records from North Carolina Register of Deeds Offices were used to identify participants for the Carolina African-American Twin Study of Aging (CAATSA). Participants completed an in-person interview that included measures of health status, cognition and psychosocial measures. Data for the analysis come from 200 pairs of same-sex twins (97 identical pairs and 113 fraternal), with a mean age = 46.9 years (SD = 13.9) and 38% of the sample being men. Compared to previous research on smoking, our estimates are very similar with genetics, accounting for about 60% of the individual variance in current smoking. We did find that there was a significant amount of genetic variance in pack years but no shared environmental influences. Similarity in proportions of genetic influences lead to larger questions about the genes involved in smoking among African Americans working in the same manner as in Caucasians or other groups. Additionally, this same question holds for the environmental variance. It is perhaps most likely that while the proportions of environmental variance are similar between groups that the actual source of variance (e.g., poverty, urban rural context, socioeconomic status, attitudes of family and friends) may differ when comparing ethnic groups.","D001741; D005260; D014644; D015438; D006306; D006801; D007407; D008297; D008875; D012307; D012309; D012907; D012931; D014427; D014481","Black or African American; Female; Genetic Variation; Health Behavior; Health Surveys; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Risk-Taking; Smoking; Social Environment; Twins; United States","1R01-AG13662-01A2","NA",NA,"Keith E Whitfield, Gary King, Stephanie Moller, Christopher L Edwards, Tracy Nelson, David Vandenbergh","Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University, P.O.

Although knowledge about HIV/AIDS and protective sexual behaviour are linked theoretically, relatively little is known about their empirical relationship. Using Demographic and Health Survey data from 23 low- and middle-income countries, this study used multilevel logistic regression models: to examine cross-national variability in the relationship between HIV/AIDS knowledge and protective behaviour (condom use and restricted sex); to investigate the moderating influences of women's educational attainment on this relationship; and to test the extent to which severity of the HIV/AIDS epidemic accounts for cross-national variability in the association between HIV/AIDS knowledge and protective behaviour. There was an association between increased knowledge of HIV/AIDS and condom use that varied in strength and form cross-nationally. This cross-national variation was accounted for partially by the socioeconomic characteristics of women resident in the study countries and between-country differences in the severity of the HIV epidemic. While education modified the association between HIV/AIDS knowledge and protective behaviour--stronger associations at lower levels of education--epidemic severity exerted a stronger influence on behaviour than any other characteristic. Finally, this study indicates that protective sexual practices are disturbingly low. In eight of 23 countries, overall levels of condom use to prevent STDs and HIV/AIDS were less than 5.0%. Waiting for the spread of HIV/AIDS infection to change sexual practices in low- and middle-income countries will result in dramatic unnecessary suffering.","D000163; D000328; D000349; D002489; D017280; D004522; D005260; D015658; D007722; D006801; D007182; D016015; D011203; D012307; D021841; D015229; D012923; D013020","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Adult; Africa; Central America; Condoms; Educational Status; Female; HIV Infections; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Income; Logistic Models; Poverty; Risk Factors; Safe Sex; Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Viral; Social Class; South America",NA,"NA",NA,"Dana Snelling, D Walter Rasugu Omariba, Sungjin Hong, Katholiki Georgiades, Yvonne Racine, Michael H Boyle","Offord Centre for Child Studies and Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University and Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation, Hamilton, Canada."

However, modelling human mental disorders in experimental animals is fraught with difficulties. Depression models generally lack both clinical and scientific credibility and have, thus far, failed to inform treatment strategies previously acquired through serendipity. The complexity and heterogeneity of the clinical states labelled 'depression' dictate that we continue to work with a crude and uninformative taxonomy within which 'core' clinical and pathophysiological features of depression are not clearly identified. Consequently, much of the neuroscience of animal modelling is framed around physiological and neurobiological phenomena that may be of relevance to only a minority of patients. Additionally, inferring pathophysiology from apparent treatment responses overestimates the efficacy of existing treatments and tends to ignore reliable demonstrations of the 'antidepressant effects' of non-pharmacological interventions. Whilst animal modelling remains a potentially important approach towards understanding neurobiological mechanisms in depression, we need to address the poverty of reliable clinical science that should inform model development.","D000818; D000928; D002986; D003863; D003866; D004195; D006801; D007206; D011613; D013312","Animals; Antidepressive Agents; Clinical Trials as Topic; Depression; Depressive Disorder; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Individuality; Psychotherapy; Stress, Physiological",NA,"NA",NA,"Keith Matthews, David Christmas, John Swan, Eleanor Sorrell","Division of Pathology and Neuroscience, Department of Psychiatry, University of Dundee, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee DD1 9SY, UK."

Besides these well-known motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms may develop, such as depression, cognitive impairment and psychosis. Psychotic symptoms constitute a relatively common but nevertheless serious complication, with visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions often being most prominent. These symptoms are important contributors to patient and caregiver distress and are often important risk factors for nursing home placement. Exogenous (related to therapeutic interventions) factors are of major importance but endogenous (related to the disease process itself) factors might also contribute to the development of psychotic symptoms in PD. Therapeutic strategies comprise reduction of antiparkinsonian treatment, cholinesterase inhibitors and atypical antipsychotics.

One such subprocess could be the active orientation of attention to significant or novel stimuli. In this study, we used skin conductance responses (SCRs) to index orienting responses (ORs). ERP activity was examined in relation to concomitant ORs in a schizophrenia and nonpsychiatric control group. Schizophrenia responses were considered with respect to the Reality Distortion, Disorganisation and Psychomotor Poverty syndromes. Forty schizophrenia and 40 age and sex matched control subjects were tested. The three schizophrenia syndromes were derived from a principal component analysis of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) ratings. Auditory ERPs (N100, N200, P200, P300) were elicited using a conventional auditory oddball paradigm, and electrodermal SCR data were acquired simultaneously. ERP data were sub-averaged according to the presence/absence of an OR. For both 'with-' and 'without-OR' ERPs, schizophrenia subjects as a group showed reduced N100 (associated with vigilance level) and N200 (associated with response selection) amplitude, and for with-OR responses, they showed an additional reduction in P300 (context processing). Concerning schizophrenia syndromes, Reality Distortion was related primarily to frontal disturbances (earlier N100/N200 latency and decreased P200/P300 amplitude), and Psychomotor Poverty to a generally delayed P300 latency. Similarly delayed P300 in Disorganisation was explained by medication effects. There were no associations with syndromes for without-OR ERPs. These results suggest that schizophrenia syndromes are dissociated with regard to both the direction and nature of speed of information processing disturbances, in relation to task-relevant information that produces active orientation.","D000293; D000328; D005071; D005260; D005625; D005712; D006801; D008297; D008875; D011601; D012559; D012720; D011795","Adolescent; Adult; Evoked Potentials; Female; Frontal Lobe; Galvanic Skin Response; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychophysics; Schizophrenia; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires",NA,"NA",NA,"Leanne Lea M Williams, Homayoun Bahramali, David R Hemsley, Anthony W F Harris, Kerri Brown, Evian Gordon","Cognitive Neuroscience Unit, Department of Psychology, University of Sydney, Sydney NSW 2006, Australia."

Brain dysfunction itself not only constitutes a formidable liability to psychopathology, but also has an impact on environmental and social responses to the individual, compounding the risk for an adverse outcome. Environmental conditions, such as social and physical stimulus deprivation, poverty, traumatic stress, and prenatal drug exposure, can further compromise brain function in the context of existing liabilities. The relationship between genetic and environmental processes is interactive, fluid, and cumulative in their ability to influence an individual's developmental trajectory and alter subsequent behavioral outcomes. Given the codependent relationship between these processes, brain function is now believed to be malleable via manipulations of the environment in ways that may decrease liability for psychopathology. Research that explores these relationships and ways in which interventions can redirect this developmental track may substantially advance both the science and practice of prevention. Studies attempting to isolate the neurobiological effects of socioenvironmental factors are reviewed, implications for intervention strategies are discussed, and a future research agenda is proposed to provide greater insight into specific brain-environment relationships.

The specificity of SPEM dysfunction to Disorganization was verified in comparisons among schizophrenia subgroups and the control group. By contrast, the general domains of positive and negative symptoms were both found to be modestly associated with SPEM dysfunction.

Little is known about the natural history of the infection in humans, but some of the mechanisms whereby the parasite remains silent and evades the host immune response are understood. Symptomatic neurocysticercosis usually results from host inflammatory response after parasite death, and the clinical manifestations can be diverse. There is no evidence that cysticidal treatment does more good than harm in addition to conventional antiepileptic treatment. Population control measures involving immunisation or mass treatment have not shown long term effectiveness.Epilepsy, similarly to neurocysticercosis, is a largely unrecognised but increasing burden on the welfare and economies of developing countries. The technology of drug treatment and psychosocial rehabilitation is well known but requires widespread and effective dissemination at low cost. There is little epidemiological data on risk factors for epilepsy in developing countries on which to base prevention strategies. The public health prioritisation of chronic disorders such as epilepsy remains a challenge for policy and practice in developing countries. For both neurocysticercosis and epilepsy, there is a dilemma about whether limited public resources would better be spent on general economic development, which would be expected to have a broad impact on the health and welfare of communities, or on specific programmes to help individual affected people with neurocysticercosis and epilepsy. Either approach requires detailed economic evaluation.","D017281; D003906; D004827; D006801; D020019","Cost of Illness; Developing Countries; Epilepsy; Humans; Neurocysticercosis",NA,"NA",NA,"D K Pal, A Carpio, J W Sander","Neurosciences Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London, UK."

In the present study, the suicide rate of the richest and poorest countries of Sweden were compared to test whether the negative correlation previously found locally between average income in the country and incidence of suicide, also exists in a nationwide extrapolation. The poorest county of Sweden, Berg, manifested an increased suicide rate of 46.2 per 100,000 population [Ratio observed/ expected (O/E) 2.3], whereas the richest, Danderyd, had a rate four times lower (10.8; Ratio O/E, 0.5), being also lower than the Swedish mean suicide rate of 17.2. The findings do not support the socioeconomic hypothesis on incidence of suicide, according to which an increased suicide rate is expected to be observed in demographic units with increased income or economic output.","D003431; D003430; D006801; D015994; D011203; D011593; D012307; D012959; D013405; D013548","Cross-Cultural Comparison; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Incidence; Poverty; Psychology, Social; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Suicide; Sweden",NA,"NA",NA,"M Ferrada-Noli","Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden."

At the same time the human value spin-offs of brain research are thrust into a strategic position of top concern because of their key role as criteria or policy priorities and decision-making guidelines. Recent conceptual developments in the mind-brain sciences rejecting reductionism and mechanistic determinism on the one side, and dualisms on the other, clear the way for a rational approach to the theory and prescription of values and to natural fusion of science and religion. Science can be upheld as the best route to an increased understanding and report with the forces that made and move the universe and created man. The outlines of the value-belief system emerge that include an ultimate respect for nature and the evolving quality of the biosphere, which, if implemented, would set in motion the kind of social change needed to lead us out of the viscious spirals of increasing population, pollution, poverty, energy demands, etc. The strategic importance of neuroscience and the central role of prevailing concepts of the mind-brain relation to all of the foregoing remain evident throughout, as does also the direct relevance of efforts to bring added insight and substantiation of these mind-brain concepts through further advances in brain research.","D000818; D006801; D009424; D009482; D010684; D012106; D014481","Animals; Humans; Nervous System Physiological Phenomena; Neurophysiology; Philosophy; Research; United States",NA,"NA",NA,"R W Sperry",NA
